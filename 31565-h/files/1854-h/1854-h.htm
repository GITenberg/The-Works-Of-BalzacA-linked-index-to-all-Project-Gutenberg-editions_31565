                             DEDICATION

  To Monsieur le Marquis de Pastoret, Member of the Academie des
  Beaux-Arts.

  When we think of the enormous number of volumes that have been
  published on the question as to where Hannibal crossed the Alps,
  without our being able to decide to-day whether it was (according
  to Whittaker and Rivaz) by Lyon, Geneva, the Great Saint-Bernard,
  and the valley of Aosta; or (according to Letronne, Follard,
  Saint-Simon and Fortia d&rsquo;Urbano) by the Isere, Grenoble,
  Saint-Bonnet, Monte Genevra, Fenestrella, and the Susa passage;
  or (according to Larauza) by the Mont Cenis and the Susa; or
  (according to Strabo, Polybius and Lucanus) by the Rhone, Vienne,
  Yenne, and the Dent du Chat; or (according to some intelligent
  minds) by Genoa, La Bochetta, and La Scrivia,&mdash;an opinion which I
  share and which Napoleon adopted,&mdash;not to speak of the verjuice
  with which the Alpine rocks have been bespattered by other learned
  men,&mdash;is it surprising, Monsieur le marquis, to see modern history
  so bemuddled that many important points are still obscure, and the
  most odious calumnies still rest on names that ought to be
  respected?

  And let me remark, in passing, that Hannibal&rsquo;s crossing has been
  made almost problematical by these very elucidations. For
  instance, Pere Menestrier thinks that the Scoras mentioned by
  Polybius is the Saona; Letronne, Larauza and Schweighauser think
  it is the Isere; Cochard, a learned Lyonnais, calls it the Drome,
  and for all who have eyes to see there are between Scoras and
  Scrivia great geographical and linguistical resemblances,&mdash;to say
  nothing of the probability, amounting almost to certainty, that
  the Carthaginian fleet was moored in the Gulf of Spezzia or the
  roadstead of Genoa. I could understand these patient researches if
  there were any doubt as to the battle of Canna; but inasmuch as
  the results of that great battle are known, why blacken paper with
  all these suppositions (which are, as it were, the arabesques of
  hypothesis) while the history most important to the present day,
  that of the Reformation, is full of such obscurities that we are
  ignorant of the real name of the man who navigated a vessel by
  steam to Barcelona at the period when Luther and Calvin were
  inaugurating the insurrection of thought.[*]

  You and I hold, I think, the same opinion, after having made, each
  in his own way, close researches as to the grand and splendid
  figure of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. Consequently, I have thought that
  my historical studies upon that queen might properly be dedicated
  to an author who has written so much on the history of the
  Reformation; while at the same time I offer to the character and
  fidelity of a monarchical writer a public homage which may,
  perhaps, be valuable on account of its rarity.

  [*] The name of the man who tried this experiment at Barcelona
  should be given as Salomon de Caux, not Caus. That great man
  has always been unfortunate; even after his death his name is
  mangled. Salomon, whose portrait taken at the age of forty-six
  was discovered by the author of the &ldquo;Comedy of Human Life&rdquo; at
  Heidelberg, was born at Caux in Normandy. He was the author of
  a book entitled &ldquo;The Causes of Moving Forces,&rdquo; in which he
  gave the theory of the expansion and condensation of steam.
  He died in 1635.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a general cry of paradox when scholars, struck by some historical
      error, attempt to correct it; but, for whoever studies modern history to
      its depths, it is plain that historians are privileged liars, who lend
      their pen to popular beliefs precisely as the newspapers of the day, or
      most of them, express the opinions of their readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical independence has shown itself much less among lay writers than
      among those of the Church. It is from the Benedictines, one of the glories
      of France, that the purest light has come to us in the matter of history,&mdash;so
      long, of course, as the interests of the order were not involved. About
      the middle of the eighteenth century great and learned controversialists,
      struck by the necessity of correcting popular errors endorsed by
      historians, made and published to the world very remarkable works. Thus
      Monsieur de Launoy, nicknamed the &ldquo;Expeller of Saints,&rdquo; made cruel war
      upon the saints surreptitiously smuggled into the Church. Thus the
      emulators of the Benedictines, the members (too little recognized) of the
      Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres, began on many obscure
      historical points a series of monographs, which are admirable for
      patience, erudition, and logical consistency. Thus Voltaire, for a
      mistaken purpose and with ill-judged passion, frequently cast the light of
      his mind on historical prejudices. Diderot undertook in this direction a
      book (much too long) on the era of imperial Rome. If it had not been for
      the French Revolution, <i>criticism</i> applied to history might then have
      prepared the elements of a good and true history of France, the proofs for
      which had long been gathered by the Benedictines. Louis XVI., a just mind,
      himself translated the English work in which Walpole endeavored to explain
      Richard III.,&mdash;a work much talked of in the last century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do personages so celebrated as kings and queens, so important as the
      generals of armies, become objects of horror or derision? Half the world
      hesitates between the famous song on Marlborough and the history of
      England, and it also hesitates between history and popular tradition as to
      Charles IX. At all epochs when great struggles take place between the
      masses and authority, the populace creates for itself an <i>ogre-esque</i>
      personage&mdash;if it is allowable to coin a word to convey a just idea.
      Thus, to take an example in our own time, if it had not been for the
      &ldquo;Memorial of Saint Helena,&rdquo; and the controversies between the Royalists
      and the Bonapartists, there was every probability that the character of
      Napoleon would have been misunderstood. A few more Abbe de Pradits, a few
      more newspaper articles, and from being an emperor, Napoleon would have
      turned into an ogre.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does error propagate itself? The mystery is accomplished under our
      very eyes without our perceiving it. No one suspects how much solidity the
      art of printing has given both to the envy which pursues greatness, and to
      the popular ridicule which fastens a contrary sense on a grand historical
      act. Thus, the name of the Prince de Polignac is given throughout the
      length and breadth of France to all bad horses that require whipping; and
      who knows how that will affect the opinion of the future as to the <i>coup
      d&rsquo;Etat</i> of the Prince de Polignac himself? In consequence of a whim of
      Shakespeare&mdash;or perhaps it may have been a revenge, like that of
      Beaumarchais on Bergasse (Bergearss)&mdash;Falstaff is, in England, a type
      of the ridiculous; his very name provokes laughter; he is the king of
      clowns. Now, instead of being enormously pot-bellied, absurdly amorous,
      vain, drunken, old, and corrupted, Falstaff was one of the most
      distinguished men of his time, a Knight of the Garter, holding a high
      command in the army. At the accession of Henry V. Sir John Falstaff was
      only thirty-four years old. This general, who distinguished himself at the
      battle of Agincourt, and there took prisoner the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, captured,
      in 1420, the town of Montereau, which was vigorously defended. Moreover,
      under Henry VI. he defeated ten thousand French troops with fifteen
      hundred weary and famished men.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for war. Now let us pass to literature, and see our own Rabelais,
      a sober man who drank nothing but water, but is held to be, nevertheless,
      an extravagant lover of good cheer and a resolute drinker. A thousand
      ridiculous stories are told about the author of one of the finest books in
      French literature,&mdash;&ldquo;Pantagruel.&rdquo; Aretino, the friend of Titian, and
      the Voltaire of his century, has, in our day, a reputation the exact
      opposite of his works and of his character; a reputation which he owes to
      a grossness of wit in keeping with the writings of his age, when broad
      farce was held in honor, and queens and cardinals wrote tales which would
      be called, in these days, licentious. One might go on multiplying such
      instances indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France, and that, too, during the most serious epoch of modern history,
      no woman, unless it be Brunehaut or Fredegonde, has suffered from popular
      error so much as Catherine de&rsquo; Medici; whereas Marie de&rsquo; Medici, all of
      whose actions were prejudicial to France, has escaped the shame which
      ought to cover her name. Marie de&rsquo; Medici wasted the wealth amassed by
      Henri IV.; she never purged herself of the charge of having known of the
      king&rsquo;s assassination; her <i>intimate</i> was d&rsquo;Epernon, who did not ward
      off Ravaillac&rsquo;s blow, and who was proved to have known the murderer
      personally for a long time. Marie&rsquo;s conduct was such that she forced her
      son to banish her from France, where she was encouraging her other son,
      Gaston, to rebel; and the victory Richelieu at last won over her (on the
      Day of the Dupes) was due solely to the discovery the cardinal made, and
      imparted to Louis XIII., of secret documents relating to the death of
      Henri IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, on the contrary, saved the crown of France; she
      maintained the royal authority in the midst of circumstances under which
      more than one great prince would have succumbed. Having to make head
      against factions and ambitions like those of the Guises and the house of
      Bourbon, against men such as the two Cardinals of Lorraine, the two
      Balafres, and the two Condes, against the queen Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, Henri
      IV., the Connetable de Montmorency, Calvin, the three Colignys, Theodore
      de Beze, she needed to possess and to display the rare qualities and
      precious gifts of a statesman under the mocking fire of the Calvinist
      press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those facts are incontestable. Therefore, to whosoever burrows into the
      history of the sixteenth century in France, the figure of Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici will seem like that of a great king. When calumny is once
      dissipated by facts, recovered with difficulty from among the
      contradictions of pamphlets and false anecdotes, all explains itself to
      the fame of this extraordinary woman, who had none of the weaknesses of
      her sex, who lived chaste amid the license of the most dissolute court in
      Europe, and who, in spite of her lack of money, erected noble public
      buildings, as if to repair the loss caused by the iconoclasms of the
      Calvinists, who did as much harm to art as to the body politic. Hemmed in
      between the Guises who claimed to be the heirs of Charlemagne and the
      factious younger branch who sought to screen the treachery of the
      Connetable de Bourbon behind the throne, Catherine, forced to combat
      heresy which was seeking to annihilate the monarchy, without friends,
      aware of treachery among the leaders of the Catholic party, foreseeing a
      republic in the Calvinist party, Catherine employed the most dangerous but
      the surest weapon of public policy,&mdash;craft. She resolved to trick and
      so defeat, successively, the Guises who were seeking the ruin of the house
      of Valois, the Bourbons who sought the crown, and the Reformers (the
      Radicals of those days) who dreamed of an impossible republic&mdash;like
      those of our time; who have, however, nothing to reform. Consequently, so
      long as she lived, the Valois kept the throne of France. The great
      historian of that time, de Thou, knew well the value of this woman when,
      on hearing of her death, he exclaimed: &ldquo;It is not a woman, it is monarchy
      itself that has died!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine had, in the highest degree, the sense of royalty, and she
      defended it with admirable courage and persistency. The reproaches which
      Calvinist writers have cast upon her are to her glory; she incurred them
      by reason only of her triumphs. Could she, placed as she was, triumph
      otherwise than by craft? The whole question lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for violence, that means is one of the most disputed questions of
      public policy; in our time it has been answered on the Place Louis XV.,
      where they have now set up an Egyptian stone, as if to obliterate regicide
      and offer a symbol of the system of materialistic policy which governs us;
      it was answered at the Carmes and at the Abbaye; answered on the steps of
      Saint-Roch; answered once more by the people against the king before the
      Louvre in 1830, as it has since been answered by Lafayette&rsquo;s best of all
      possible republics against the republican insurrection at Saint-Merri and
      the rue Transnonnain. All power, legitimate or illegitimate, must defend
      itself when attacked; but the strange thing is that where the people are
      held heroic in their victory over the nobility, power is called murderous
      in its duel with the people. If it succumbs after its appeal to force,
      power is then called imbecile. The present government is attempting to
      save itself by two laws from the same evil Charles X. tried to escape by
      two ordinances; is it not a bitter derision? Is craft permissible in the
      hands of power against craft? may it kill those who seek to kill it? The
      massacres of the Revolution have replied to the massacres of
      Saint-Bartholomew. The people, become king, have done against the king and
      the nobility what the king and the nobility did against the insurgents of
      the sixteenth century. Therefore the popular historians, who know very
      well that in a like case the people will do the same thing over again,
      have no excuse for blaming Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and Charles IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All power,&rdquo; said Casimir Perier, on learning what power ought to be, &ldquo;is
      a permanent conspiracy.&rdquo; We admire the anti-social maxims put forth by
      daring writers; why, then, this disapproval which, in France, attaches to
      all social truths when boldly proclaimed? This question will explain, in
      itself alone, historical errors. Apply the answer to the destructive
      doctrines which flatter popular passions, and to the conservative
      doctrines which repress the mad efforts of the people, and you will find
      the reason of the unpopularity and also the popularity of certain
      personages. Laubardemont and Laffemas were, like some men of to-day,
      devoted to the defence of power in which they believed. Soldiers or
      judges, they all obeyed royalty. In these days d&rsquo;Orthez would be dismissed
      for having misunderstood the orders of the ministry, but Charles X. left
      him governor of a province. The power of the many is accountable to no
      one; the power of one is compelled to render account to its subjects, to
      the great as well as to the small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, like Philip the Second and the Duke of Alba, like the Guises
      and Cardinal Granvelle, saw plainly the future that the Reformation was
      bringing upon Europe. She and they saw monarchies, religion, authority
      shaken. Catherine wrote, from the cabinet of the kings of France, a
      sentence of death to that spirit of inquiry which then began to threaten
      modern society; a sentence which Louis XIV. ended by executing. The
      revocation of the Edict of Nantes was an unfortunate measure only so far
      as it caused the irritation of all Europe against Louis XIV. At another
      period England, Holland, and the Holy Roman Empire would not have welcomed
      banished Frenchmen and encouraged revolt in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why refuse, in these days, to the majestic adversary of the most barren of
      heresies the grandeur she derived from the struggle itself? Calvinists
      have written much against the &ldquo;craftiness&rdquo; of Charles IX.; but travel
      through France, see the ruins of noble churches, estimate the fearful
      wounds given by the religionists to the social body, learn what vengeance
      they inflicted, and you will ask yourself, as you deplore the evils of
      individualism (the disease of our present France, the germ of which was in
      the questions of liberty of conscience then agitated),&mdash;you will ask
      yourself, I say, on which side were the executioners. There are,
      unfortunately, as Catherine herself says in the third division of this
      Study of her career, &ldquo;in all ages hypocritical writers always ready to
      weep over the fate of two hundred scoundrels killed necessarily.&rdquo; Caesar,
      who tried to move the senate to pity the attempt of Catiline, might
      perhaps have got the better of Cicero could he have had an Opposition and
      its newspapers at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another consideration explains the historical and popular disfavor in
      which Catherine is held. The Opposition in France has always been
      Protestant, because it has had no policy but that of <i>negation</i>; it
      inherits the theories of Lutherans, Calvinists, and Protestants on the
      terrible words &ldquo;liberty,&rdquo; &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; &ldquo;progress,&rdquo; and &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; Two
      centuries have been employed by the opponents of power in establishing the
      doubtful doctrine of the <i>libre arbitre</i>,&mdash;liberty of will. Two
      other centuries were employed in developing the first corollary of liberty
      of will, namely, liberty of conscience. Our century is endeavoring to
      establish the second, namely, political liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed between the ground already lost and the ground still to be
      defended, Catherine and the Church proclaimed the salutary principle of
      modern societies, <i>una fides, unus dominus</i>, using their power of
      life and death upon the innovators. Though Catherine was vanquished,
      succeeding centuries have proved her justification. The product of liberty
      of will, religious liberty, and political liberty (not, observe this, to
      be confounded with civil liberty) is the France of to-day. What is the
      France of 1840? A country occupied exclusively with material interests,&mdash;without
      patriotism, without conscience; where power has no vigor; where election,
      the fruit of liberty of will and political liberty, lifts to the surface
      none but commonplace men; where brute force has now become a necessity
      against popular violence; where discussion, spreading into everything,
      stifles the action of legislative bodies; where money rules all questions;
      where individualism&mdash;the dreadful product of the division of property
      <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;will suppress the family and devour all, even
      the nation, which egoism will some day deliver over to invasion. Men will
      say, &ldquo;Why not the Czar?&rdquo; just as they said, &ldquo;Why not the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans?&rdquo;
       We don&rsquo;t cling to many things even now; but fifty years hence we shall
      cling to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, according to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and according to all those who
      believe in a well-ordered society, in <i>social man</i>, the subject
      cannot have liberty of will, ought not to <i>teach</i> the dogma of
      liberty of conscience, or demand political liberty. But, as no society can
      exist without guarantees granted to the subject against the sovereign,
      there results for the subject <i>liberties</i> subject to restriction.
      Liberty, no; liberties, yes,&mdash;precise and well-defined liberties.
      That is in harmony with the nature of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, assuredly, beyond the reach of human power to prevent the liberty
      of thought; and no sovereign can interfere with money. The great statesmen
      who were vanquished in the long struggle (it lasted five centuries)
      recognized the right of subjects to great liberties; but they did not
      admit their right to publish anti-social thoughts, nor did they admit the
      indefinite liberty of the subject. To them the words &ldquo;subject&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; were terms that contradicted each other; just as the theory of
      citizens being all equal constitutes an absurdity which nature contradicts
      at every moment. To recognize the necessity of a religion, the necessity
      of authority, and then to leave to subjects the right to deny religion,
      attack its worship, oppose the exercise of power by public expression
      communicable and communicated by thought, was an impossibility which the
      Catholics of the sixteenth century would not hear of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! the victory of Calvinism will cost France more in the future than it
      has yet cost her; for religious sects and humanitarian, equality-levelling
      politics are, to-day, the tail of Calvinism; and, judging by the mistakes
      of the present power, its contempt for intellect, its love for material
      interests, in which it seeks the basis of its support (though material
      interests are the most treacherous of all supports), we may predict that
      unless some providence intervenes, the genius of destruction will again
      carry the day over the genius of preservation. The assailants, who have
      nothing to lose and all to gain, understand each other thoroughly; whereas
      their rich adversaries will not make any sacrifice either of money or
      self-love to draw to themselves supporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of printing came to the aid of the opposition begun by the Vaudois
      and the Albigenses. As soon as human thought, instead of condensing
      itself, as it was formerly forced to do to remain in communicable form,
      took on a multitude of garments and became, as it were, the people itself,
      instead of remaining a sort of axiomatic divinity, there were two
      multitudes to combat,&mdash;the multitude of ideas, and the multitude of
      men. The royal power succumbed in that warfare, and we are now assisting,
      in France, at its last combination with elements which render its
      existence difficult, not to say impossible. Power is action, and the
      elective principle is discussion. There is no policy, no statesmanship
      possible where discussion is permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore we ought to recognize the grandeur of the woman who had the eyes
      to see this future and fought it bravely. That the house of Bourbon was
      able to succeed to the house of Valois, that it found a crown preserved to
      it, was due solely to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. Suppose the second Balafre had
      lived? No matter how strong the Bearnais was, it is doubtful whether he
      could have seized the crown, seeing how dearly the Duc de Mayenne and the
      remains of the Guise party sold it to him. The means employed by
      Catherine, who certainly had to reproach herself with the deaths of
      Francois II. and Charles IX., whose lives might have been saved in time,
      were never, it is observable, made the subject of accusations by either
      the Calvinists or modern historians. Though there was no poisoning, as
      some grave writers have said, there was other conduct almost as criminal;
      there is no doubt she hindered Pare from saving one, and allowed the other
      to accomplish his own doom by moral assassination. But the sudden death of
      Francois II., and that of Charles IX., were no injury to the Calvinists,
      and therefore the causes of these two events remained in their secret
      sphere, and were never suspected either by the writers of the people of
      that day; they were not divined except by de Thou, l&rsquo;Hopital, and minds of
      that calibre, or by the leaders of the two parties who were coveting or
      defending the throne, and believed such means necessary to their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Popular songs attacked, strangely enough, Catherine&rsquo;s morals. Every one
      knows the anecdote of the soldier who was roasting a goose in the
      courtyard of the chateau de Tours during the conference between Catherine
      and Henri IV., singing, as he did so, a song in which the queen was
      grossly insulted. Henri IV. drew his sword to go out and kill the man; but
      Catherine stopped him and contented herself with calling from the window
      to her insulter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! but it was Catherine who gave you the goose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the executions at Amboise were attributed to Catherine, and though
      the Calvinists made her responsible for all the inevitable evils of that
      struggle, it was with her as it was, later, with Robespierre, who is still
      waiting to be justly judged. Catherine was, moreover, rightly punished for
      her preference for the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou, to whose interests the two elder
      brothers were sacrificed. Henri III., like all spoilt children, ended in
      becoming absolutely indifferent to his mother, and he plunged voluntarily
      into the life of debauchery which made of him what his mother had made of
      Charles IX., a husband without sons, a king without heirs. Unhappily the
      Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, Catherine&rsquo;s last male child, had already died, a natural
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words of the great queen were like a summing up of her lifelong
      policy, which was, moreover, so plain in its common-sense that all
      cabinets are seen under similar circumstances to put it in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough cut off, my son,&rdquo; she said when Henri III. came to her death-bed
      to tell her that the great enemy of the crown was dead, &ldquo;<i>now piece
      together</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By which she meant that the throne should at once reconcile itself with
      the house of Lorraine and make use of it, as the only means of preventing
      evil results from the hatred of the Guises,&mdash;by holding out to them
      the hope of surrounding the king. But the persistent craft and
      dissimulation of the woman and the Italian, which she had never failed to
      employ, was incompatible with the debauched life of her son. Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici once dead, the policy of the Valois died also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before undertaking to write the history of the manners and morals of this
      period in action, the author of this Study has patiently and minutely
      examined the principal reigns in the history of France, the quarrel of the
      Burgundians and the Armagnacs, that of the Guises and the Valois, each of
      which covers a century. His first intention was to write a picturesque
      history of France. Three women&mdash;Isabella of Bavaria, Catharine and
      Marie de&rsquo; Medici&mdash;hold an enormous place in it, their sway reaching
      from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century, ending in Louis XIV. Of
      these three queens, Catherine is the finer and more interesting. Hers was
      virile power, dishonored neither by the terrible amours of Isabella nor by
      those, even more terrible, though less known, of Marie de&rsquo; Medici.
      Isabella summoned the English into France against her son, and loved her
      brother-in-law, the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans. The record of Marie de&rsquo; Medici is
      heavier still. Neither had political genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the course of these studies that the writer acquired the
      conviction of Catherine&rsquo;s greatness; as he became initiated into the
      constantly renewed difficulties of her position, he saw with what
      injustice historians&mdash;all influenced by Protestants&mdash;had treated
      this queen. Out of this conviction grew the three sketches which here
      follow; in which some erroneous opinions formed upon Catherine, also upon
      the persons who surrounded her, and on the events of her time, are
      refuted. If this book is placed among the Philosophical Studies, it is
      because it shows the Spirit of a Time, and because we may clearly see in
      it the influence of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before entering the political arena, where Catherine will be seen
      facing the two great difficulties of her career, it is necessary to give a
      succinct account of her preceding life, from the point of view of
      impartial criticism, in order to take in as much as possible of this vast
      and regal existence up to the moment when the first part of the present
      Study begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there any period, in any land, in any sovereign family, a
      greater contempt for legitimacy than in the famous house of the Medici. On
      the subject of power they held the same doctrine now professed by Russia,
      namely: to whichever head the crown goes, he is the true, the legitimate
      sovereign. Mirabeau had reason to say: &ldquo;There has been but one mesalliance
      in my family,&mdash;that of the Medici&rdquo;; for in spite of the paid efforts
      of genealogists, it is certain that the Medici, before Everardo de&rsquo; 
      Medici, <i>gonfaloniero</i> of Florence in 1314, were simple Florentine
      merchants who became very rich. The first personage in this family who
      occupies an important place in the history of the famous Tuscan republic
      is Silvestro de&rsquo; Medici, <i>gonfaloniero</i> in 1378. This Silvestro had
      two sons, Cosmo and Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Cosmo are descended Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Duc de Nemours, the
      Duc d&rsquo;Urbino, father of Catherine, Pope Leo X., Pope Clement VII., and
      Alessandro, not Duke of Florence, as historians call him, but Duke <i>della
      citta di Penna</i>, a title given by Pope Clement VII., as a half-way
      station to that of Grand-duke of Tuscany.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Lorenzo are descended the Florentine Brutus Lorenzino, who killed
      Alessandro, Cosmo, the first grand-duke, and all the sovereigns of Tuscany
      till 1737, at which period the house became extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither of the two branches&mdash;the branch Cosmo and the branch
      Lorenzo&mdash;reigned through their direct and legitimate lines until the
      close of the sixteenth century, when the grand-dukes of Tuscany began to
      succeed each other peacefully. Alessandro de&rsquo; Medici, he to whom the title
      of Duke <i>della citta di Penna</i> was given, was the son of the Duke
      d&rsquo;Urbino, Catherine&rsquo;s father, by a Moorish slave. For this reason
      Lorenzino claimed a double right to kill Alessandro,&mdash;as a usurper in
      his house, as well as an oppressor of the city. Some historians believe
      that Alessandro was the son of Clement VII. The fact that led to the
      recognition of this bastard as chief of the republic and head of the house
      of the Medici was his marriage with Margaret of Austria, natural daughter
      of Charles V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco de&rsquo; Medici, husband of Bianca Capello, accepted as his son a
      child of poor parents bought by the celebrated Venetian; and, strange to
      say, Ferdinando, on succeeding Francesco, maintained the substituted child
      in all his rights. That child, called Antonio de&rsquo; Medici, was considered
      during four reigns as belonging to the family; he won the affection of
      everybody, rendered important services to the family, and died universally
      regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the first Medici had natural children, whose careers were
      invariably brilliant. For instance, the Cardinal Giulio de&rsquo; Medici,
      afterwards Pope under the name of Clement VII., was the illegitimate son
      of Giuliano I. Cardinal Ippolito de&rsquo; Medici was also a bastard, and came
      very near being Pope and the head of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorenzo II., the father of Catherine, married in 1518, for his second
      wife, Madeleine de la Tour de Boulogne, in Auvergne, and died April 25,
      1519, a few days after his wife, who died in giving birth to Catherine.
      Catherine was therefore orphaned of father and mother as soon as she drew
      breath. Hence the strange adventures of her childhood, mixed up as they
      were with the bloody efforts of the Florentines, then seeking to recover
      their liberty from the Medici. The latter, desirous of continuing to reign
      in Florence, behaved with such circumspection that Lorenzo, Catherine&rsquo;s
      father, had taken the name of Duke d&rsquo;Urbino.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Lorenzo&rsquo;s death, the head of the house of the Medici was Pope Leo X.,
      who sent the illegitimate son of Giuliano, Giulio de&rsquo; Medici, then
      cardinal, to govern Florence. Leo X. was great-uncle to Catherine, and
      this Cardinal Giulio, afterward Clement VII., was her uncle by the left
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the siege of Florence, undertaken by the Medici to force
      their return there, that the Republican party, not content with having
      shut Catherine, then nine years old, into a convent, after robbing her of
      all her property, actually proposed, on the suggestion of one named
      Batista Cei, to expose her between two battlements on the walls to the
      artillery of the Medici. Bernardo Castiglione went further in a council
      held to determine how matters should be ended: he was of opinion that, so
      far from returning her to the Pope as the latter requested, she ought to
      be given to the soldiers for dishonor. This will show how all popular
      revolutions resemble each other. Catherine&rsquo;s subsequent policy, which
      upheld so firmly the royal power, may well have been instigated in part by
      such scenes, of which an Italian girl of nine years of age was assuredly
      not ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of Alessandro de&rsquo; Medici, to which the bastard Pope Clement VII.
      powerfully contributed, was no doubt chiefly caused by the affection of
      Charles V. for his famous illegitimate daughter Margaret. Thus Pope and
      emperor were prompted by the same sentiment. At this epoch Venice had the
      commerce of the world; Rome had its moral government; Italy still reigned
      supreme through the poets, the generals, the statesmen born to her. At no
      period of the world&rsquo;s history, in any land, was there ever seen so
      remarkable, so abundant a collection of men of genius. There were so many,
      in fact, that even the lesser princes were superior men. Italy was crammed
      with talent, enterprise, knowledge, science, poesy, wealth, and gallantry,
      all the while torn by intestinal warfare and overrun with conquerors
      struggling for possession of her finest provinces. When men are so strong,
      they do not fear to admit their weaknesses. Hence, no doubt, this golden
      age for bastards. We must, moreover, do the illegitimate children of the
      house of the Medici the justice to say that they were ardently devoted to
      the glory, power, and increase of wealth of that famous family. Thus as
      soon as the <i>Duca della citta di Penna</i>, son of the Moorish woman,
      was installed as tyrant of Florence, he espoused the interest of Pope
      Clement VII., and gave a home to the daughter of Lorenzo II., then eleven
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we study the march of events and that of men in this curious
      sixteenth century, we ought never to forget that public policy had for its
      element a perpetual craftiness and a dissimulation which destroyed, in all
      characters, the straightforward, upright bearing our imaginations demand
      of eminent personages. In this, above all, is Catherine&rsquo;s absolution. It
      disposes of the vulgar and foolish accusations of treachery launched
      against her by the writers of the Reformation. This was the great age of
      that statesmanship the code of which was written by Macchiavelli as well
      as by Spinosa, by Hobbes as well as by Montesquieu,&mdash;for the dialogue
      between Sylla and Eucrates contains Montesquieu&rsquo;s true thought, which his
      connection with the Encyclopedists did not permit him to develop otherwise
      than as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      These principles are to-day the secret law of all cabinets in which plans
      for the conquest and maintenance of great power are laid. In France we
      blamed Napoleon when he made use of that Italian genius for craft which
      was bred in his bone,&mdash;though in his case it did not always succeed.
      But Charles V., Catherine, Philip II., and Pope Julius would not have
      acted otherwise than as he did in the affair of Spain. History, in the
      days when Catherine was born, if judged from the point of view of honesty,
      would seem an impossible tale. Charles V., obliged to sustain Catholicism
      against the attacks of Luther, who threatened the Throne in threatening
      the Tiara, allowed the siege of Rome and held Pope Clement VII. in prison!
      This same Clement, who had no bitterer enemy than Charles V., courted him
      in order to make Alessandro de&rsquo; Medici ruler of Florence, and obtained his
      favorite daughter for that bastard. No sooner was Alessandro established
      than he, conjointly with Clement VII., endeavored to injure Charles V. by
      allying himself with Francois I., king of France, by means of Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici; and both of them promised to assist Francois in reconquering
      Italy. Lorenzino de&rsquo; Medici made himself the companion of Alessandro&rsquo;s
      debaucheries for the express purpose of finding an opportunity to kill
      him. Filippo Strozzi, one of the great minds of that day, held this murder
      in such respect that he swore that his sons should each marry a daughter
      of the murderer; and each son religiously fulfilled his father&rsquo;s oath when
      they might all have made, under Catherine&rsquo;s protection, brilliant
      marriages; for one was the rival of Doria, the other a marshal of France.
      Cosmo de&rsquo; Medici, successor of Alessandro, with whom he had no
      relationship, avenged the death of that tyrant in the cruellest manner,
      with a persistency lasting twelve years; during which time his hatred
      continued keen against the persons who had, as a matter of fact, given him
      the power. He was eighteen years old when called to the sovereignty; his
      first act was to declare the rights of Alessandro&rsquo;s legitimate sons null
      and void,&mdash;all the while avenging their father&rsquo;s death! Charles V.
      confirmed the disinheriting of his grandsons, and recognized Cosmo instead
      of the son of Alessandro and his daughter Margaret. Cosmo, placed on the
      throne by Cardinal Cibo, instantly exiled the latter; and the cardinal
      revenged himself by accusing Cosmo (who was the first grand-duke) of
      murdering Alessandro&rsquo;s son. Cosmo, as jealous of his power as Charles V.
      was of his, abdicated in favor of his son Francesco, after causing the
      death of his other son, Garcia, to avenge the death of Cardinal Giovanni
      de&rsquo; Medici, whom Garcia had assassinated. Cosmo the First and his son
      Francesco, who ought to have been devoted, body and soul, to the house of
      France, the only power on which they might really have relied, made
      themselves the lacqueys of Charles V. and Philip II., and were
      consequently the secret, base, and perfidious enemies of Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici, one of the glories of their house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the leading contradictory and illogical traits, the treachery,
      knavery, and black intrigues of a single house, that of the Medici. From
      this sketch, we may judge of the other princes of Italy and Europe. All
      the envoys of Cosmos I. to the court of France had, in their secret
      instructions, an order to poison Strozzi, Catherine&rsquo;s relation, when he
      arrived. Charles V. had already assassinated three of the ambassadors of
      Francois I.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early in the month of October, 1533, that the <i>Duca della citta
      di Penna</i> started from Florence for Livorno, accompanied by the sole
      heiress of Lorenzo II., namely, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. The duke and the
      Princess of Florence, for that was the title by which the young girl, then
      fourteen years of age, was known, left the city surrounded by a large
      retinue of servants, officers, and secretaries, preceded by armed men, and
      followed by an escort of cavalry. The young princess knew nothing as yet
      of what her fate was to be, except that the Pope was to have an interview
      at Livorno with the Duke Alessandro; but her uncle, Filippo Strozzi, very
      soon informed her of the future before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filippo Strozzi had married Clarice de&rsquo; Medici, half-sister on the
      father&rsquo;s side of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, Duke of Urbino, father of Catherine;
      but this marriage, which was brought about as much to convert one of the
      firmest supporters of the popular party to the cause of the Medici as to
      facilitate the recall of that family, then banished from Florence, never
      shook the stern champion from his course, though he was persecuted by his
      own party for making it. In spite of all apparent changes in his conduct
      (for this alliance naturally affected it somewhat) he remained faithful to
      the popular party, and declared himself openly against the Medici as soon
      as he foresaw their intention to enslave Florence. This great man even
      refused the offer of a principality made to him by Leo X.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of which we are now writing Filippo Strozzi was a victim to
      the policy of the Medici, so vacillating in its means, so fixed and
      inflexible in its object. After sharing the misfortunes and the captivity
      of Clement VII. when the latter, surprised by the Colonna, took refuge in
      the Castle of Saint-Angelo, Strozzi was delivered up by Clement as a
      hostage and taken to Naples. As the Pope, when he got his liberty, turned
      savagely on his enemies, Strozzi came very near losing his life, and was
      forced to pay an enormous sum to be released from a prison where he was
      closely confined. When he found himself at liberty he had, with an
      instinct of kindness natural to an honest man, the simplicity to present
      himself before Clement VII., who had perhaps congratulated himself on
      being well rid of him. The Pope had such good cause to blush for his own
      conduct that he received Strozzi extremely ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strozzi thus began, early in life, his apprenticeship in the misfortunes
      of an honest man in politics,&mdash;a man whose conscience cannot lend
      itself to the capriciousness of events; whose actions are acceptable only
      to the virtuous; and who is therefore persecuted by the world,&mdash;by
      the people, for opposing their blind passions; by power for opposing its
      usurpations. The life of such great citizens is a martyrdom, in which they
      are sustained only by the voice of their conscience and an heroic sense of
      social duty, which dictates their course in all things. There were many
      such men in the republic of Florence, all as great as Strozzi, and as able
      as their adversaries the Medici, though vanquished by the superior craft
      and wiliness of the latter. What could be more worthy of admiration than
      the conduct of the chief of the Pazzi at the time of the conspiracy of his
      house, when, his commerce being at that time enormous, he settled all his
      accounts with Asia, the Levant, and Europe before beginning that great
      attempt; so that, if it failed, his correspondents should lose nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the establishment of the house of the Medici in the
      fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is a magnificent tale which still
      remains to be written, though men of genius have already put their hands
      to it. It is not the history of a republic, nor of a society, nor of any
      special civilization; it is the history of <i>statesmen</i>, the eternal
      history of Politics,&mdash;that of usurpers, that of conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Filippo Strozzi returned to Florence he re-established the
      preceding form of government and ousted Ippolito de&rsquo; Medici, another
      bastard, and the very Alessandro with whom, at the later period of which
      we are now writing, he was travelling to Livorno. Having completed this
      change of government, he became alarmed at the evident inconstancy of the
      people of Florence, and, fearing the vengeance of Clement VII., he went to
      Lyon to superintend a vast house of business he owned there, which
      corresponded with other banking-houses of his own in Venice, Rome, France,
      and Spain. Here we find a strange thing. These men who bore the weight of
      public affairs and of such a struggle as that with the Medici (not to
      speak of contentions with their own party) found time and strength to bear
      the burden of a vast business and all its speculations, also of banks and
      their complications, which the multiplicity of coinages and their
      falsification rendered even more difficult than it is in our day. The name
      &ldquo;banker&rdquo; comes from the <i>banc</i> (Anglice, <i>bench</i>) upon which the
      banker sat, and on which he rang the gold and silver pieces to try their
      quality. After a time Filippo found in the death of his wife, whom he
      adored, a pretext for renewing his relations with the Republican party,
      whose secret police becomes the more terrible in all republics, because
      every one makes himself a spy in the name of a liberty which justifies
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filippo returned to Florence at the very moment when that city was
      compelled to adopt the yoke of Alessandro; but he had previously gone to
      Rome and seen Pope Clement VII., whose affairs were now so prosperous that
      his disposition toward Strozzi was much changed. In the hour of triumph
      the Medici were so much in need of a man like Filippo&mdash;were it only
      to smooth the return of Alessandro&mdash;that Clement urged him to take a
      seat at the Council of the bastard who was about to oppress the city; and
      Strozzi consented to accept the diploma of a senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for the last two years and more, he had seen, like Seneca and
      Burrhus, the beginnings of tyranny in his Nero. He felt himself, at the
      moment of which we write, an object of so much distrust on the part of the
      people and so suspected by the Medici whom he was constantly resisting,
      that he was confident of some impending catastrophe. Consequently, as soon
      as he heard from Alessandro of the negotiation for Catherine&rsquo;s marriage
      with the son of Francois I., the final arrangements for which were to be
      made at Livorno, where the negotiators had appointed to meet, he formed
      the plan of going to France, and attaching himself to the fortunes of his
      niece, who needed a guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alessandro, delighted to rid himself of a man so unaccommodating in the
      affairs of Florence, furthered a plan which relieved him of one murder at
      least, and advised Strozzi to put himself at the head of Catherine&rsquo;s
      household. In order to dazzle the eyes of France the Medici had selected a
      brilliant suite for her whom they styled, very unwarrantably, the Princess
      of Florence, and who also went by the name of the little Duchess d&rsquo;Urbino.
      The cortege, at the head of which rode Alessandro, Catherine, and Strozzi,
      was composed of more than a thousand persons, not including the escort and
      servants. When the last of it issued from the gates of Florence the head
      had passed that first village beyond the city where they now braid the
      Tuscan straw hats. It was beginning to be rumored among the people that
      Catherine was to marry a son of Francois I.; but the rumor did not obtain
      much belief until the Tuscans beheld with their own eyes this triumphal
      procession from Florence to Livorno.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine herself, judging by all the preparations she beheld, began to
      suspect that her marriage was in question, and her uncle then revealed to
      her the fact that the first ambitious project of his house had aborted,
      and that the hand of the dauphin had been refused to her. Alessandro still
      hoped that the Duke of Albany would succeed in changing this decision of
      the king of France who, willing as he was to buy the support of the Medici
      in Italy, would only grant them his second son, the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans. This
      petty blunder lost Italy to France, and did not prevent Catherine from
      becoming queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Albany, son of Alexander Stuart, brother of James III., king
      of Scotland, had married Anne de la Tour de Boulogne, sister of Madeleine
      de la Tour de Boulogne, Catherine&rsquo;s mother; he was therefore her maternal
      uncle. It was through her mother that Catherine was so rich and allied to
      so many great families; for, strangely enough, her rival, Diane de
      Poitiers, was also her cousin. Jean de Poitiers, father of Diane, was son
      of Jeanne de Boulogne, aunt of the Duchess d&rsquo;Urbino. Catherine was also a
      cousin of Mary Stuart, her daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine now learned that her dowry in money was a hundred thousand
      ducats. A ducat was a gold piece of the size of an old French louis,
      though less thick. (The old louis was worth twenty-four francs&mdash;the
      present one is worth twenty). The Comtes of Auvergne and Lauraguais were
      also made a part of the dowry, and Pope Clement added one hundred thousand
      ducats in jewels, precious stones, and other wedding gifts; to which
      Alessandro likewise contributed his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at Livorno, Catherine, still so young, must have been
      flattered by the extreme magnificence displayed by Pope Clement (&ldquo;her
      uncle in Notre-Dame,&rdquo; then head of the house of the Medici), in order to
      outdo the court of France. He had already arrived at Livorno in one of his
      galleys, which was lined with crimson satin fringed with gold, and covered
      with a tent-like awning in cloth of gold. This galley, the decoration of
      which cost twenty thousand ducats, contained several apartments destined
      for the bride of Henri of France, all of which were furnished with the
      richest treasures of art the Medici could collect. The rowers,
      magnificently apparelled, and the crew were under the command of a prior
      of the order of the Knights of Rhodes. The household of the Pope were in
      three other galleys. The galleys of the Duke of Albany, anchored near
      those of Clement VII., added to the size and dignity of the flotilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke Alessandro presented the officers of Catherine&rsquo;s household to the
      Pope, with whom he had a secret conference, in which, it would appear, he
      presented to his Holiness Count Sebastiano Montecuculi, who had just left,
      somewhat abruptly, the service of Charles V. and that of his two generals,
      Antonio di Leyva and Ferdinando di Gonzago. Was there between the two
      bastards, Giulio and Alessandro, a premeditated intention of making the
      Duc d&rsquo;Orleans dauphin? What reward was promised to Sebastiano Montecuculi,
      who, before entering the service of Charles V. had studied medicine?
      History is silent on that point. We shall see presently what clouds hang
      round that fact. The obscurity is so great that, quite recently, grave and
      conscientious historians have admitted Montecuculi&rsquo;s innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine then heard officially from the Pope&rsquo;s own lips of the alliance
      reserved for her. The Duke of Albany had been able to do no more than hold
      the king of France, and that with difficulty, to his promise of giving
      Catherine the hand of his second son, the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans. The Pope&rsquo;s
      impatience was so great, and he was so afraid that his plans would be
      thwarted either by some intrigue of the emperor, or by the refusal of
      France, or by the grandees of the kingdom looking with evil eye upon the
      marriage, that he gave orders to embark at once, and sailed for Marseille,
      where he arrived toward the end of October, 1533.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding its wealth, the house of the Medici was eclipsed on this
      occasion by the court of France. To show the lengths to which the Medici
      pushed their magnificence, it is enough to say that the &ldquo;dozen&rdquo; put into
      the bride&rsquo;s purse by the Pope were twelve gold medals of priceless
      historical value, which were then unique. But Francois I., who loved the
      display of festivals, distinguished himself on this occasion. The wedding
      festivities of Henri de Valois and Catherine de&rsquo; Medici lasted thirty-four
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to repeat the details, which have been given in all the
      histories of Provence and Marseille, as to this celebrated interview
      between the Pope and the king of France, which was opened by a jest of the
      Duke of Albany as to the duty of keeping fasts,&mdash;a jest mentioned by
      Brantome and much enjoyed by the court, which shows the tone of the
      manners of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many conjectures have been made as to Catherine&rsquo;s barrenness, which lasted
      ten years. Strange calumnies still rest upon this queen, all of whose
      actions were fated to be misjudged. It is sufficient to say that the cause
      was solely in Henri II. After the difficulty was removed, Catherine had
      ten children. The delay was, in one respect, fortunate for France. If
      Henri II. had had children by Diane de Poitiers the politics of the
      kingdom would have been dangerously complicated. When the difficulty was
      removed the Duchesse de Valentinois had reached the period of a woman&rsquo;s
      second youth. This matter alone will show that the true life of Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici is still to be written, and also&mdash;as Napoleon said with
      profound wisdom&mdash;that the history of France should be either in one
      volume only, or one thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a contemporaneous and succinct account of the meeting of Clement
      VII. and the king of France:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His Holiness the Pope, having been conducted to the palace, which
  was, as I have said, prepared beyond the port, every one retired
  to their own quarters till the morrow, when his Holiness was to
  make his entry; the which was made with great sumptuousness and
  magnificence, he being seated in a chair carried on the shoulders
  of two men and wearing his pontifical robes, but not the tiara.
  Pacing before him was a white hackney, bearing the sacrament of
  the altar,&mdash;the said hackney being led by reins of white silk held
  by two footmen finely equipped. Next came all the cardinals in
  their robes, on pontifical mules, and Madame la Duchesse d&rsquo;Urbino
  in great magnificence, accompanied by a vast number of ladies and
  gentlemen, both French and Italian.

  &ldquo;The Holy Father having arrived in the midst of this company at
  the place appointed for his lodging, every one retired; and all
  this, being well-ordered, took place without disorder or tumult.
  While the Pope was thus making his entry, the king crossed the
  water in a frigate and went to the lodging the Pope had just
  quitted, in order to go the next day and make obeisance to the
  Holy Father as a Most Christian king.

  &ldquo;The next day the king being prepared set forth for the palace
  where was the Pope, accompanied by the princes of the blood, such
  as Monseigneur le Duc de Vendomois (father of the Vidame de
  Chartres), the Comte de Sainct-Pol, Messieurs de Montpensier and
  la Roche-sur-Yon, the Duc de Nemours (brother of the Duc de
  Savoie) who died in this said place, the Duke of Albany, and many
  others, whether counts, barons, or seigneurs; nearest to the king
  was the Seigneur de Montmorency, his Grand-master.

  &ldquo;The king, being arrived at the palace, was received by the Pope
  and all the college of cardinals, assembled in consistory, most
  civilly. This done, each retired to the place ordained for him,
  the king taking with him several cardinals to feast them,&mdash;among
  them Cardinal de&rsquo; Medici, nephew of the Pope, a very splendid man
  with a fine retinue.

  &ldquo;On the morrow those persons chosen by his Holiness and by the
  king began to assemble to discuss the matters for which the
  meeting was made. First, the matter of the Faith was treated of,
  and a bull was put forth repressing heresy and preventing that
  things come to greater combustion than they now are.

  &ldquo;After this was concluded the marriage of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans,
  second son of the king, with Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, Duchesse
  d&rsquo;Urbino, niece of his Holiness, under the conditions such, or
  like to those, as were proposed formerly by the Duke of Albany.
  The said espousals were celebrated with great magnificence, and
  our Holy Father himself wedded the pair. The marriage thus
  consummated, the Holy Father held a consistory at which he created
  four cardinals and devoted them to the king,&mdash;to wit: Cardinal Le
  Veneur, formerly bishop of Lisieux and grand almoner; the Cardinal
  de Boulogne of the family of la Chambre, brother on the mother&rsquo;s
  side of the Duke of Albany; the Cardinal de Chatillon of the house
  of Coligny, nephew of the Sire de Montmorency, and the Cardinal de
  Givry.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Strozzi delivered the dowry in presence of the court he noticed some
      surprise on the part of the French seigneurs; they even said aloud that it
      was little enough for such a mesalliance (what would they have said in
      these days?). Cardinal Ippolito replied, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be ill-informed as to the secrets of your king. His Holiness has
      bound himself to give to France three pearls of inestimable value, namely:
      Genoa, Milan, and Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pope left Sebastiano Montecuculi to present himself to the court of
      France, to which the count offered his services, complaining of his
      treatment by Antonio di Leyva and Ferdinando di Gonzago, for which reason
      his services were accepted. Montecuculi was not made a part of Catherine&rsquo;s
      household, which was wholly composed of French men and women, for, by a
      law of the monarchy, the execution of which the Pope saw with great
      satisfaction, Catherine was naturalized by letters-patent as a Frenchwoman
      before the marriage. Montecuculi was appointed in the first instance to
      the household of the queen, the sister of Charles V. After a while he
      passed into the service of the dauphin as cup-bearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Duchesse d&rsquo;Orleans soon found herself a nullity at the court of
      Francois I. Her young husband was in love with Diane de Poitiers, who
      certainly, in the matter of birth, could rival Catherine, and was far more
      of a great lady than the little Florentine. The daughter of the Medici was
      also outdone by Queen Eleonore, sister of Charles V., and by Madame
      d&rsquo;Etampes, whose marriage with the head of the house of Brosse made her
      one of the most powerful and best titled women in France. Catherine&rsquo;s aunt
      the Duchess of Albany, the Queen of Navarre, the Duchesse de Guise, the
      Duchesse de Vendome, Madame la Connetable de Montmorency, and other women
      of like importance, eclipsed by birth and by their rights, as well as by
      their power at the most sumptuous court of France (not excepting that of
      Louis XIV.), the daughter of the Florentine grocers, who was richer and
      more illustrious through the house of the Tour de Boulogne than by her own
      family of Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of his niece was so bad and difficult that the republican
      Filippo Strozzi, wholly incapable of guiding her in the midst of such
      conflicting interests, left her after the first year, being recalled to
      Italy by the death of Clement VII. Catherine&rsquo;s conduct, when we remember
      that she was scarcely fifteen years old, was a model of prudence. She
      attached herself closely to the king, her father-in-law; she left him as
      little as she could, following him on horseback both in hunting and in
      war. Her idolatry for Francois I. saved the house of the Medici from all
      suspicion when the dauphin was poisoned. Catherine was then, and so was
      her husband, at the headquarters of the king in Provence; for Charles V.
      had speedily invaded France and the late scene of the marriage festivities
      had become the theatre of a cruel war.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Charles V. was put to flight, leaving the bones of his
      army in Provence, the dauphin was returning to Lyon by the Rhone. He
      stopped to sleep at Tournon, and, by way of pastime, practised some
      violent physical exercises,&mdash;which were nearly all the education his
      brother and he, in consequence of their detention as hostages, had ever
      received. The prince had the imprudence&mdash;it being the month of
      August, and the weather very hot&mdash;to ask for a glass of water, which
      Montecuculi, as his cup-bearer, gave to him, with ice in it. The dauphin
      died almost immediately. Francois I. adored his son. The dauphin was,
      according to all accounts, a charming young man. His father, in despair,
      gave the utmost publicity to the proceedings against Montecuculi, which he
      placed in the hands of the most able magistrates of that day. The count,
      after heroically enduring the first tortures without confessing anything,
      finally made admissions by which he implicated Charles V. and his two
      generals, Antonio di Leyva and Ferdinando di Gonzago. No affair was ever
      more solemnly debated. Here is what the king did, in the words of an
      ocular witness:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The king called an assembly at Lyon of all the princes of his
  blood, all the knights of his order, and other great personages of
  the kingdom; also the legal and papal nuncio, the cardinals who
  were at his court, together with the ambassadors of England,
  Scotland, Portugal, Venice, Ferrara, and others; also all the
  princes and noble strangers, both Italian and German, who were
  then residing at his court in great numbers. These all being
  assembled, he caused to be read to them, in presence of each
  other, from beginning to end, the trial of the unhappy man who
  poisoned Monseigneur the late dauphin,&mdash;with all the
  interrogatories, confessions, confrontings, and other ceremonies
  usual in criminal trials; he, the king, not being willing that the
  sentence should be executed until all present had given their
  opinion on this heinous and miserable case.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The fidelity, devotion, and cautious skill of the Comte de Montecuculi may
      seem extraordinary in our time, when all the world, even ministers of
      State, tell everything about the least little event with which they have
      to do; but in those days princes could find devoted servants, or knew how
      to choose them. Monarchical Moreys existed because in those days there was
      <i>faith</i>. Never ask devotion of <i>self-interest</i>, because such
      interest may change; but expect all from sentiments, religious faith,
      monarchical faith, patriotic faith. Those three beliefs produced such men
      as the Berthereaus of Geneva, the Sydneys and Straffords of England, the
      murderers of Thomas a Becket, the Jacques Coeurs, the Jeanne d&rsquo;Arcs, the
      Richelieus, Dantons, Bonchamps, Talmonts, and also the Clements, Chabots,
      and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dauphin was poisoned in the same manner, and possibly by the same drug
      which afterwards served MADAME under Louis XIV. Pope Clement VII. had been
      dead two years; Duke Alessandro, plunged in debauchery, seemed to have no
      interest in the elevation of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans; Catherine, then seventeen,
      and full of admiration for her father-in-law, was with him at the time;
      Charles V. alone appeared to have an interest in his death, for Francois
      I. was negotiating for his son an alliance which would assuredly have
      aggrandized France. The count&rsquo;s confession was therefore very skilfully
      based on the passions and politics of the moment; Charles V. was then
      flying from France, leaving his armies buried in Provence with his
      happiness, his reputation, and his hopes of dominion. It is to be remarked
      that if torture had forced admissions from an innocent man, Francois I.
      gave Montecuculi full liberty to speak in presence of an imposing
      assembly, and before persons in whose eyes innocence had some chance to
      triumph. The king, who wanted the truth, sought it in good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her now brilliant future, Catherine&rsquo;s situation at court was
      not changed by the death of the dauphin. Her barrenness gave reason to
      fear a divorce in case her husband should ascend the throne. The dauphin
      was under the spell of Diane de Poitiers, who assumed to rival Madame
      d&rsquo;Etampes, the king&rsquo;s mistress. Catherine redoubled in care and cajolery
      of her father-in-law, being well aware that her sole support was in him.
      The first ten years of Catherine&rsquo;s married life were years of ever-renewed
      grief, caused by the failure, one by one, of her hopes of pregnancy, and
      the vexations of her rivalry with Diane. Imagine what must have been the
      life of a young princess, watched by a jealous mistress who was supported
      by a powerful party,&mdash;the Catholic party,&mdash;and by the two
      powerful alliances Diane had made in marrying one daughter to Robert de la
      Mark, Duc de Bouillon, Prince of Sedan, and the other to Claude de
      Lorraine, Duc d&rsquo;Aumale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, helpless between the party of Madame d&rsquo;Etampes and the party of
      the Senechale (such was Diane&rsquo;s title during the reign of Francois I.),
      which divided the court and politics into factions for these mortal
      enemies, endeavored to make herself the friend of both Diane de Poitiers
      and Madame d&rsquo;Etampes. She, who was destined to become so great a queen,
      played the part of a servant. Thus she served her apprenticeship in that
      double-faced policy which was ever the secret motor of her life. Later,
      the <i>queen</i> was to stand between Catholics and Calvinists, just as
      the <i>woman</i> had stood for ten years between Madame d&rsquo;Etampes and
      Madame de Poitiers. She studied the contradictions of French politics; she
      saw Francois I. sustaining Calvin and the Lutherans in order to embarrass
      Charles V., and then, after secretly and patiently protecting the
      Reformation in Germany, and tolerating the residence of Calvin at the
      court of Navarre, he suddenly turned against it with excessive rigor.
      Catherine beheld on the one hand the court, and the women of the court,
      playing with the fire of heresy, and on the other, Diane at the head of
      the Catholic party with the Guises, solely because the Duchesse d&rsquo;Etampes
      supported Calvin and the Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the political education of this queen, who saw in the cabinet of
      the king of France the same errors committed as in the house of the
      Medici. The dauphin opposed his father in everything; he was a bad son. He
      forgot the cruel but most vital maxim of royalty, namely, that thrones
      need solidarity; and that a son who creates opposition during the lifetime
      of his father must follow that father&rsquo;s policy when he mounts the throne.
      Spinosa, who was as great a statesman as he was a philosopher, said&mdash;in
      the case of one king succeeding another by insurrection or crime,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If the new king desires to secure the safety of his throne and of
  his own life he must show such ardor in avenging the death of his
  predecessor that no one shall feel a desire to commit the same
  crime. But to avenge it <i>worthily</i> it is not enough to shed the
  blood of his subjects, he must approve the axioms of the king he
  replaces, and take the same course in governing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was the application of this maxim which gave Florence to the Medici.
      Cosmo I. caused to be assassinated at Venice, after eleven years&rsquo; sway,
      the Florentine Brutus, and, as we have already said, persecuted the
      Strozzi. It was forgetfulness of this maxim which ruined Louis XVI. That
      king was false to every principle of royal government when he
      re-established the parliaments suppressed by his grandfather. Louis XV.
      saw the matter clearly. The parliaments, and notably that of Paris,
      counted for fully half in the troubles which necessitated the convocation
      of the States-general. The fault of Louis XV. was, that in breaking down
      that barrier which separated the throne from the people he did not erect a
      stronger; in other words, that he did not substitute for parliament a
      strong constitution of the provinces. There lay the remedy for the evils
      of the monarchy; thence should have come the voting on taxes, the
      regulation of them, and a slow approval of reforms that were necessary to
      the system of monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act of Henri II. was to give his confidence to the Connetable de
      Montmorency, whom his father had enjoined him to leave in disgrace. The
      Connetable de Montmorency was, with Diane de Poitiers, to whom he was
      closely bound, the master of the State. Catherine was therefore less happy
      and less powerful after she became queen of France than while she was
      dauphiness. From 1543 she had a child every year for ten years, and was
      occupied with maternal cares during the period covered by the last three
      years of the reign of Francois I. and nearly the whole of the reign of
      Henri II. We may see in this recurring fecundity the influence of a rival,
      who was able thus to rid herself of the legitimate wife,&mdash;a barbarity
      of feminine policy which must have been one of Catherine&rsquo;s grievances
      against Diane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus set aside from public life, this superior woman passed her time in
      observing the self-interests of the court people and of the various
      parties which were formed about her. All the Italians who had followed her
      were objects of violent suspicion. After the execution of Montecuculi the
      Connetable de Montmorency, Diane, and many of the keenest politicians of
      the court were filled with suspicion of the Medici; though Francois I.
      always repelled it. Consequently, the Gondi, Strozzi, Ruggieri, Sardini,
      etc.,&mdash;in short, all those who were called distinctively &ldquo;the
      Italians,&rdquo;&mdash;were compelled to employ greater resources of mind,
      shrewd policy, and courage, to maintain themselves at court against the
      weight of disfavor which pressed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her husband&rsquo;s reign Catherine&rsquo;s amiability to Diane de Poitiers
      went to such great lengths that intelligent persons must regard it as
      proof of that profound dissimulation which men, events, and the conduct of
      Henri II. compelled Catherine de&rsquo; Medici to employ. But they go too far
      when they declare that she never claimed her rights as wife and queen. In
      the first place, the sense of dignity which Catherine possessed in the
      highest degree forbade her claiming what historians call her rights as a
      wife. The ten children of the marriage explain Henri&rsquo;s conduct; and his
      wife&rsquo;s maternal occupations left him free to pass his time with Diane de
      Poitiers. But the king was never lacking in anything that was due to
      himself; and he gave Catherine an &ldquo;entry&rdquo; into Paris, to be crowned as
      queen, which was worthy of all such pageants that had ever taken place.
      The archives of the Parliament, and those of the Cour des Comptes, show
      that those two great bodies went to meet her outside of Paris as far as
      Saint Lazare. Here is an extract from du Tillet&rsquo;s account of it:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A platform had been erected at Saint-Lazare, on which was a
  throne (du Tillet calls it a <i>chair de parement</i>). Catherine took
  her seat upon it, wearing a surcoat, or species of ermine
  short-cloak covered with precious stones, a bodice beneath it with
  the royal mantle, and on her head a crown enriched with pearls and
  diamonds, and held in place by the Marechale de la Mark, her lady
  of honor. Around her <i>stood</i> the princes of the blood, and other
  princes and seigneurs, richly apparelled, also the chancellor of
  France in a robe of gold damask on a background of crimson-red.
  Before the queen, and on the same platform, were seated, in two
  rows, twelve duchesses or countesses, wearing ermine surcoats,
  bodices, robes, and circlets,&mdash;that is to say, the coronets of
  duchesses and countesses. These were the Duchesses d&rsquo;Estouteville,
  Montpensier (elder and younger); the Princesses de la
  Roche-sur-Yon; the Duchesses de Guise, de Nivernois, d&rsquo;Aumale, de
  Valentinois (Diane de Poitiers), Mademoiselle la batarde legitimee
  de France (the title of the king&rsquo;s daughter, Diane, who was
  Duchesse de Castro-Farnese and afterwards Duchesse de
  Montmorency-Damville), Madame la Connetable, and Mademoiselle de
  Nemours; without mentioning other demoiselles who were not seated.
  The four presidents of the courts of justice, wearing their caps,
  several other members of the court, and the clerk du Tillet, mounted
  the platform, made reverent bows, and the chief judge, Lizet,
  kneeling down, harangued the queen. The chancellor then knelt down
  and answered. The queen made her entry at half-past three o&rsquo;clock in
  an open litter, having Madame Marguerite de France sitting
  opposite to her, and on either side of the litter the Cardinals of
  Amboise, Chatillon, Boulogne, and de Lenoncourt in their episcopal
  robes. She left her litter at the church of Notre-Dame, where she
  was received by the clergy. After offering her prayer, she was
  conducted by the rue de la Calandre to the palace, where the royal
  supper was served in the great hall. She there appeared, seated at
  the middle of the marble table, beneath a velvet dais strewn with
  golden fleur-de-lis.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We may here put an end to one of those popular beliefs which are repeated
      in many writers from Sauval down. It has been said that Henri II. pushed
      his neglect of the proprieties so far as to put the initials of his
      mistress on the buildings which Catherine advised him to continue or to
      begin with so much magnificence. But the double monogram which can be seen
      at the Louvre offers a daily denial to those who are so little
      clear-sighted as to believe in silly nonsense which gratuitously insults
      our kings and queens. The H or Henri and the two C&rsquo;s of Catherine which
      back it, appear to represent the two D&rsquo;s of Diane. The coincidence may
      have pleased Henri II., but it is none the less true that the royal
      monogram contained officially the initial of the king and that of the
      queen. This is so true that the monogram can still be seen on the column
      of the Halle au Ble, which was built by Catherine alone. It can also be
      seen in the crypt of Saint-Denis, on the tomb which Catherine erected for
      herself in her lifetime beside that of Henri II., where her figure is
      modelled from nature by the sculptor to whom she sat for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a solemn occasion, when he was starting, March 25, 1552, for his
      expedition into Germany, Henri II. declared Catherine regent during his
      absence, and also in case of his death. Catherine&rsquo;s most cruel enemy, the
      author of &ldquo;Marvellous Discourses on Catherine the Second&rsquo;s Behavior&rdquo;
       admits that she carried on the government with universal approval and that
      the king was satisfied with her administration. Henri received both money
      and men at the time he wanted them; and finally, after the fatal day of
      Saint-Quentin, Catherine obtained considerable sums of money from the
      people of Paris, which she sent to Compiegne, where the king then was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In politics, Catherine made immense efforts to obtain a little influence.
      She was clever enough to bring the Connetable de Montmorency, all-powerful
      under Henri II., to her interests. We all know the terrible answer that
      the king made, on being harassed by Montmorency in her favor. This answer
      was the result of an attempt by Catherine to give the king good advice, in
      the few moments she was ever alone with him, when she explained the
      Florentine policy of pitting the grandees of the kingdom one against
      another and establishing the royal authority on their ruins. But Henri
      II., who saw things only through the eyes of Diane and the Connetable, was
      a truly feudal king and the friend of all the great families of his
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the futile attempt of the Connetable in her favor, which must have
      been made in the year 1556, Catherine began to cajole the Guises for the
      purpose of detaching them from Diane and opposing them to the Connetable.
      Unfortunately, Diane and Montmorency were as vehement against the
      Protestants as the Guises. There was therefore not the same animosity in
      their struggle as there might have been had the religious question entered
      it. Moreover, Diane boldly entered the lists against the queen&rsquo;s project
      by coquetting with the Guises and giving her daughter to the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale.
      She even went so far that certain authors declared she gave more than mere
      good-will to the gallant Cardinal de Lorraine; and the lampooners of the
      time made the following quatrain on Henri II:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sire, if you&rsquo;re weak and let your will relax
  Till Diane and Lorraine do govern you,
  Pound, knead and mould, re-melt and model you,
  Sire, you are nothing&mdash;nothing else than wax.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is impossible to regard as sincere the signs of grief and the
      ostentation of mourning which Catherine showed on the death of Henri II.
      The fact that the king was attached by an unalterable passion to Diane de
      Poitiers naturally made Catherine play the part of a neglected wife who
      adores her husband; but, like all women who act by their head, she
      persisted in this dissimulation and never ceased to speak tenderly of
      Henri II. In like manner Diane, as we know, wore mourning all her life for
      her husband the Senechal de Breze. Her colors were black and white, and
      the king was wearing them at the tournament when he was killed. Catherine,
      no doubt in imitation of her rival, wore mourning for Henri II. for the
      rest of her life. She showed a consummate perfidy toward Diane de
      Poitiers, to which historians have not given due attention. At the king&rsquo;s
      death the Duchesse de Valentinois was completely disgraced and shamefully
      abandoned by the Connetable, a man who was always below his reputation.
      Diane offered her estate and chateau of Chenonceaux to the queen.
      Catherine then said, in presence of witnesses:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never forget that she made the happiness of my dear Henri. I am
      ashamed to accept her gift; I wish to give her a domain in place of it,
      and I shall offer her that of Chaumont-sur-Loire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the deed of exchange was signed at Blois in 1559. Diane,
      whose sons-in-law were the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale and the Duc de Bouillon (then a
      sovereign prince), kept her wealth, and died in 1566 aged sixty-six. She
      was therefore nineteen years older than Henri II. These dates, taken from
      her epitaph which was copied from her tomb by the historian who concerned
      himself so much about her at the close of the last century, clear up quite
      a number of historical difficulties. Some historians have declared she was
      forty, others that she was sixteen at the time of her father&rsquo;s
      condemnation in 1523; in point of fact she was then twenty-four. After
      reading everything for and against her conduct towards Francois I. we are
      unable to affirm or to deny anything. This is one of the passages of
      history that will ever remain obscure. We may see by what happens in our
      own day how history is falsified at the very moment when events happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, who had founded great hopes on the age of her rival, tried more
      than once to overthrow her. It was a dumb, underhand, terrible struggle.
      The day came when Catherine believed herself for a moment on the verge of
      success. In 1554, Diane, who was ill, begged the king to go to
      Saint-Germain and leave her for a short time until she recovered. This
      stately coquette did not choose to be seen in the midst of medical
      appliances and without the splendors of apparel. Catherine arranged, as a
      welcome to her husband, a magnificent ballet, in which six beautiful young
      girls were to recite a poem in his honor. She chose for this function Miss
      Fleming, a relation of her uncle the Duke of Albany, the handsomest young
      woman, some say, that was ever seen, white and very fair; also one of her
      own relations, Clarice Strozzi, a magnificent Italian with superb black
      hair, and hands that were of rare beauty; Miss Lewiston, maid of honor to
      Mary Stuart; Mary Stuart herself; Madame Elizabeth of France (who was
      afterwards that unfortunate Queen of Spain); and Madame Claude. Elizabeth
      and Claude were eight and nine years old, Mary Stuart twelve; evidently
      the queen intended to bring forward Miss Fleming and Clarice Strozzi and
      present them without rivals to the king. The king fell in love with Miss
      Fleming, by whom he had a natural son, Henri de Valois, Comte d&rsquo;Angouleme,
      grand-prior of France. But the power and influence of Diane were not
      shaken. Like Madame de Pompadour with Louis XV., the Duchesse de
      Valentinois forgave all. But what sort of love did this attempt show in
      Catherine? Was it love to her husband or love of power? Women may decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal is said in these days of the license of the press; but it is
      difficult to imagine the lengths to which it went when printing was first
      invented. We know that Aretino, the Voltaire of his time, made kings and
      emperors tremble, more especially Charles V.; but the world does not know
      so well the audacity and license of pamphlets. The chateau de Chenonceaux,
      which we have just mentioned, was given to Diane, or rather not given, she
      was implored to accept it to make her forget one of the most horrible
      publications ever levelled against a woman, and which shows the violence
      of the warfare between herself and Madame d&rsquo;Etampes. In 1537, when she was
      thirty-eight years of age, a rhymester of Champagne named Jean Voute,
      published a collection of Latin verses in which were three epigrams upon
      her. It is to be supposed that the poet was sure of protection in high
      places, for the pamphlet has a preface in praise of itself, signed by
      Salmon Macrin, first valet-de-chambre to the king. Only one passage is
      quotable from these epigrams, which are entitled: IN PICTAVIAM, ANAM
      AULIGAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A painted trap catches no game,&rdquo; says the poet, after telling Diane that
      she painted her face and bought her teeth and hair. &ldquo;You may buy all that
      superficially makes a woman, but you can&rsquo;t buy that your lover wants; for
      he wants life, and you are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This collection, printed by Simon de Colines, is dedicated to a bishop!&mdash;to
      Francois Bohier, the brother of the man who, to save his credit at court
      and redeem his offence, offered to Diane, on the accession of Henri II.,
      the chateau de Chenonceaux, built by his father, Thomas Bohier, a
      councillor of state under four kings: Louis XI., Charles VIII., Louis
      XII., and Francois I. What were the pamphlets published against Madame de
      Pompadour and against Marie-Antoinette compared to these verses, which
      might have been written by Martial? Voute must have made a bad end. The
      estate and chateau cost Diane nothing more than the forgiveness enjoined
      by the gospel. After all, the penalties inflicted on the press, though not
      decreed by juries, were somewhat more severe than those of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queens of France, on becoming widows, were required to remain in the
      king&rsquo;s chamber forty days without other light than that of wax tapers;
      they did not leave the room until after the burial of the king. This
      inviolable custom was a great annoyance to Catherine, who feared cabals;
      and, by chance, she found a means to evade it, thus: Cardinal de Lorraine,
      leaving, very early in the morning, the house of the <i>belle Romaine</i>,
      a celebrated courtesan of the period, who lived in the rue
      Culture-Sainte-Catherine, was set upon and maltreated by a party of
      libertines. &ldquo;On which his holiness, being much astonished&rdquo; (says Henri
      Estienne), &ldquo;gave out that the heretics were preparing ambushes against
      him.&rdquo; The court at once removed from Paris to Saint-Germain, and the
      queen-mother, declaring that she would not abandon the king her son, went
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accession of Francois II., the period at which Catherine confidently
      believed she could get possession of the regal power, was a moment of
      cruel disappointment, after the twenty-six years of misery she had lived
      through at the court of France. The Guises laid hands on power with
      incredible audacity. The Duc de Guise was placed in command of the army;
      the Connetable was dismissed; the cardinal took charge of the treasury and
      the clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine now began her political career by a drama which, though it did
      not have the dreadful fame of those of later years, was, nevertheless,
      most horrible; and it must, undoubtedly, have accustomed her to the
      terrible after emotions of her life. While appearing to be in harmony with
      the Guises, she endeavored to pave the way for her ultimate triumph by
      seeking a support in the house of Bourbon, and the means she took were as
      follows: Whether it was that (before the death of Henri II.), and after
      fruitlessly attempting violent measures, she wished to awaken jealousy in
      order to bring the king back to her; or whether as she approached
      middle-age it seemed to her cruel that she had never known love, certain
      it is that she showed a strong interest in a seigneur of the royal blood,
      Francois de Vendome, son of Louis de Vendome (the house from which that of
      the Bourbons sprang), and Vidame de Chartres, the name under which he is
      known in history. The secret hatred which Catherine bore to Diane was
      revealed in many ways, to which historians, preoccupied by political
      interests, have paid no attention. Catherine&rsquo;s attachment to the vidame
      proceeded from the fact that the young man had offered an insult to the
      favorite. Diane&rsquo;s greatest ambition was for the honor of an alliance with
      the royal family of France. The hand of her second daughter (afterwards
      Duchesse d&rsquo;Aumale) was offered on her behalf to the Vidame de Chartres,
      who was kept poor by the far-sighted policy of Francois I. In fact, when
      the Vidame de Chartres and the Prince de Conde first came to court,
      Francois I. gave them&mdash;what? The office of chamberlain, with a paltry
      salary of twelve hundred crowns a year, the same that he gave to the
      simplest gentlemen. Though Diane de Poitiers offered an immense dowry, a
      fine office under the crown, and the favor of the king, the vidame
      refused. After which, this Bourbon, already factious, married Jeanne,
      daughter of the Baron d&rsquo;Estissac, by whom he had no children. This act of
      pride naturally commended him to Catherine, who greeted him after that
      with marked favor and made a devoted friend of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historians have compared the last Duc de Montmorency, beheaded at
      Toulouse, to the Vidame de Chartres, in the art of pleasing, in
      attainments, accomplishments, and talent. Henri II. showed no jealousy; he
      seemed not even to suppose that a queen of France could fail in her duty,
      or a Medici forget the honor done to her by a Valois. But during this time
      when the queen was, it is said, coquetting with the Vidame de Chartres,
      the king, after the birth of her last child, had virtually abandoned her.
      This attempt at making him jealous was to no purpose, for Henri died
      wearing the colors of Diane de Poitiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the king&rsquo;s death Catherine was, therefore, on terms of
      gallantry with the vidame,&mdash;a situation which was quite in conformity
      with the manners and morals of a time when love was both so chivalrous and
      so licentious that the noblest actions were as natural as the most
      blamable; although historians, as usual, have committed the mistake in
      this case of taking the exception for the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four sons of Henri II. of course rendered null the position of the
      Bourbons, who were all extremely poor and were now crushed down by the
      contempt which the Connetable de Montmorency&rsquo;s treachery brought upon
      them, in spite of the fact that the latter had thought best to fly the
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vidame de Chartres&mdash;who was to the first Prince de Conde what
      Richelieu was to Mazarin, his father in policy, his model, and, above all,
      his master in gallantry&mdash;concealed the excessive ambition of his
      house beneath an external appearance of light-hearted gaiety. Unable
      during the reign of Henri II. to make head against the Guises, the
      Montmorencys, the Scottish princes, the cardinals, and the Bouillons, he
      distinguished himself by his graceful bearing, his manners, his wit, which
      won him the favor of many charming women and the heart of some for whom he
      cared nothing. He was one of those privileged beings whose seductions are
      irresistible, and who owe to love the power of maintaining themselves
      according to their rank. The Bourbons would not have resented, as did
      Jarnac, the slander of la Chataigneraie; they were willing enough to
      accept the lands and castles of their mistresses,&mdash;witness the Prince
      de Conde, who accepted the estate of Saint-Valery from Madame la Marechale
      de Saint-Andre.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first twenty days of mourning after the death of Henri II. the
      situation of the vidame suddenly changed. As the object of the queen
      mother&rsquo;s regard, and permitted to pay his court to her as court is paid to
      a queen, very secretly, he seemed destined to play an important role, and
      Catherine did, in fact, resolve to use him. The vidame received letters
      from her for the Prince de Conde, in which she pointed out to the latter
      the necessity of an alliance against the Guises. Informed of this
      intrigue, the Guises entered the queen&rsquo;s chamber for the purpose of
      compelling her to issue an order consigning the vidame to the Bastille,
      and Catherine, to save herself, was under the hard necessity of obeying
      them. After a captivity of some months, the vidame died on the very day he
      left prison, which was shortly before the conspiracy of Amboise. Such was
      the conclusion of the first and only amour of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
      Protestant historians have said that the queen caused the vidame to be
      poisoned, to lay the secret of her gallantries in a tomb!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now shown what was the apprenticeship of this woman for the
      exercise of her royal power.

      I. A HOUSE WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT THE CORNER OF A STREET WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS IN A PARIS WHICH NO
      LONGER EXISTS
    </p>
    <p>
      Few persons in the present day know how plain and unpretentious were the
      dwellings of the burghers of Paris in the sixteenth century, and how
      simple their lives. Perhaps this simplicity of habits and of thought was
      the cause of the grandeur of that old bourgeoisie which was certainly
      grand, free, and noble,&mdash;more so, perhaps, than the bourgeoisie of
      the present day. Its history is still to be written; it requires and it
      awaits a man of genius. This reflection will doubtless rise to the lips of
      every one after reading the almost unknown incident which forms the basis
      of this Study and is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of
      that bourgeoisie. It will not be the first time in history that conclusion
      has preceded facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1560, the houses of the rue de la Vieille-Pelleterie skirted the left
      bank of the Seine, between the pont Notre-Dame and the pont au Change. A
      public footpath and the houses then occupied the space covered by the
      present roadway. Each house, standing almost in the river, allowed its
      dwellers to get down to the water by stone or wooden stairways, closed and
      protected by strong iron railings or wooden gates, clamped with iron. The
      houses, like those in Venice, had an entrance on <i>terra firma</i> and a
      water entrance. At the moment when the present sketch is published, only
      one of these houses remains to recall the old Paris of which we speak, and
      that is soon to disappear; it stands at the corner of the Petit-Pont,
      directly opposite to the guard-house of the Hotel-Dieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly each dwelling presented on the river-side the fantastic
      appearance given either by the trade of its occupant and his habits, or by
      the originality of the exterior constructions invented by the proprietors
      to use or abuse the Seine. The bridges being encumbered with more mills
      than the necessities of navigation could allow, the Seine formed as many
      enclosed basins as there were bridges. Some of these basins in the heart
      of old Paris would have offered precious scenes and tones of color to
      painters. What a forest of crossbeams supported the mills with their huge
      sails and their wheels! What strange effects were produced by the piles or
      props driven into the water to project the upper floors of the houses
      above the stream! Unfortunately, the art of genre painting did not exist
      in those days, and that of engraving was in its infancy. We have therefore
      lost that curious spectacle, still offered, though in miniature, by
      certain provincial towns, where the rivers are overhung with wooden
      houses, and where, as at Vendome, the basins, full of water grasses, are
      enclosed by immense iron railings, to isolate each proprietor&rsquo;s share of
      the stream, which extends from bank to bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of this street, which has now disappeared from the map,
      sufficiently indicates the trade that was carried on in it. In those days
      the merchants of each class of commerce, instead of dispersing themselves
      about the city, kept together in the same neighborhood and protected
      themselves mutually. Associated in corporations which limited their
      number, they were still further united into guilds by the Church. In this
      way prices were maintained. Also, the masters were not at the mercy of
      their workmen, and did not obey their whims as they do to-day; on the
      contrary, they made them their children, their apprentices, took care of
      them, and taught them the intricacies of the trade. In order to become a
      master, a workman had to produce a masterpiece, which was always dedicated
      to the saint of his guild. Will any one dare to say that the absence of
      competition destroyed the desire for perfection, or lessened the beauty of
      products? What say you, you whose admiration for the masterpieces of past
      ages has created the modern trade of the sellers of bric-a-brac?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the trade of the furrier was one
      of the most flourishing industries. The difficulty of obtaining furs,
      which, being all brought from the north, required long and perilous
      journeys, gave a very high price and value to those products. Then, as
      now, high prices led to consumption; for vanity likes to override
      obstacles. In France, as in other kingdoms, not only did royal ordinances
      restrict the use of furs to the nobility (proved by the part which ermine
      plays in the old blazons), but also certain rare furs, such as <i>vair</i>
      (which was undoubtedly Siberian sable), could not be worn by any but
      kings, dukes, and certain lords clothed with official powers. A
      distinction was made between the greater and lesser <i>vair</i>. The very
      name has been so long disused, that in a vast number of editions of
      Perrault&rsquo;s famous tale, Cinderella&rsquo;s slipper, which was no doubt of <i>vair</i>
      (the fur), is said to have been made of <i>verre</i> (glass). Lately one
      of our most distinguished poets was obliged to establish the true
      orthography of the word for the instruction of his brother-feuilletonists
      in giving an account of the opera of the &ldquo;Cenerentola,&rdquo; where the symbolic
      slipper has been replaced by a ring, which symbolizes nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally the sumptuary laws about the wearing of fur were perpetually
      infringed upon, to the great satisfaction of the furriers. The costliness
      of stuffs and furs made a garment in those days a durable thing,&mdash;as
      lasting as the furniture, the armor, and other items of that strong life
      of the fifteenth century. A woman of rank, a seigneur, all rich men, also
      all the burghers, possessed at the most two garments for each season,
      which lasted their lifetime and beyond it. These garments were bequeathed
      to their children. Consequently the clause in the marriage-contract
      relating to arms and clothes, which in these days is almost a dead letter
      because of the small value of wardrobes that need constant renewing, was
      then of much importance. Great costs brought with them solidity. The
      toilet of a woman constituted a large capital; it was reckoned among the
      family possessions, and was kept in those enormous chests which threaten
      to break through the floors of our modern houses. The jewels of a woman of
      1840 would have been the <i>undress</i> ornaments of a great lady in 1540.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, the discovery of America, the facilities of transportation, the
      ruin of social distinctions which has paved the way for the ruin of
      apparent distinctions, has reduced the trade of the furrier to what it now
      is,&mdash;next to nothing. The article which a furrier sells to-day, as in
      former days, for twenty <i>livres</i> has followed the depreciation of
      money: formerly the <i>livre</i>, which is now worth one franc and is
      usually so called, was worth twenty francs. To-day, the lesser bourgeoisie
      and the courtesans who edge their capes with sable, are ignorant than in
      1440 an ill-disposed police-officer would have incontinently arrested them
      and marched them before the justice at the Chatelet. Englishwomen, who are
      so fond of ermine, do not know that in former times none but queens,
      duchesses, and chancellors were allowed to wear that royal fur. There are
      to-day in France several ennobled families whose true name is Pelletier or
      Lepelletier, the origin of which is evidently derived from some rich
      furrier&rsquo;s counter, for most of our burgher&rsquo;s names began in some such way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This digression will explain, not only the long feud as to precedence
      which the guild of drapers maintained for two centuries against the guild
      of furriers and also of mercers (each claiming the right to walk first, as
      being the most important guild in Paris), but it will also serve to
      explain the importance of the Sieur Lecamus, a furrier honored with the
      custom of two queens, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and Mary Stuart, also the
      custom of the parliament,&mdash;a man who for twenty years was the syndic
      of his corporation, and who lived in the street we have just described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of Lecamus was one of three which formed the three angles of the
      open space at the end of the pont au Change, where nothing now remains but
      the tower of the Palais de Justice, which made the fourth angle. On the
      corner of this house, which stood at the angle of the pont au Change and
      the quai now called the quai aux Fleurs, the architect had constructed a
      little shrine for a Madonna, which was always lighted by wax-tapers and
      decked with real flowers in summer and artificial ones in winter. On the
      side of the house toward the rue du Pont, as on the side toward the rue de
      la Vieille-Pelleterie, the upper story of the house was supported by
      wooden pillars. All the houses in this mercantile quarter had an arcade
      behind these pillars, where the passers in the street walked under cover
      on a ground of trodden mud which kept the place always dirty. In all
      French towns these arcades or galleries are called <i>les piliers</i>, a
      general term to which was added the name of the business transacted under
      them,&mdash;as &ldquo;piliers des Halles&rdquo; (markets), &ldquo;piliers de la Boucherie&rdquo;
       (butchers).
    </p>
    <p>
      These galleries, a necessity in the Parisian climate, which is so
      changeable and so rainy, gave this part of the city a peculiar character
      of its own; but they have now disappeared. Not a single house in the river
      bank remains, and not more than about a hundred feet of the old &ldquo;piliers
      des Halles,&rdquo; the last that have resisted the action of time, are left; and
      before long even that relic of the sombre labyrinth of old Paris will be
      demolished. Certainly, the existence of such old ruins of the middle-ages
      is incompatible with the grandeurs of modern Paris. These observations are
      meant not so much to regret the destruction of the old town, as to
      preserve in words, and by the history of those who lived there, the memory
      of a place now turned to dust, and to excuse the following description,
      which may be precious to a future age now treading on the heels of our
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of this house were of wood covered with slate. The spaces
      between the uprights had been filled in, as we may still see in some
      provincial towns, with brick, so placed, by reversing their thickness, as
      to make a pattern called &ldquo;Hungarian point.&rdquo; The window-casings and
      lintels, also in wood, were richly carved, and so was the corner pillar
      where it rose above the shrine of the Madonna, and all the other pillars
      in front of the house. Each window, and each main beam which separated the
      different storeys, was covered with arabesques of fantastic personages and
      animals wreathed with conventional foliage. On the street side, as on the
      river side, the house was capped with a roof looking as if two cards were
      set up one against the other,&mdash;thus presenting a gable to the street
      and a gable to the water. This roof, like the roof of a Swiss chalet,
      overhung the building so far that on the second floor there was an outside
      gallery with a balustrade, on which the owners of the house could walk
      under cover and survey the street, also the river basin between the
      bridges and the two lines of houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      These houses on the river bank were very valuable. In those days a system
      of drains and fountains was still to be invented; nothing of the kind as
      yet existed except the circuit sewer, constructed by Aubriot, provost of
      Paris under Charles the Wise, who also built the Bastille, the pont
      Saint-Michel and other bridges, and was the first man of genius who ever
      thought of the sanitary improvement of Paris. The houses situated like
      that of Lecamus took from the river the water necessary for the purposes
      of life, and also made the river serve as a natural drain for rain-water
      and household refuse. The great works that the &ldquo;merchants&rsquo; provosts&rdquo; did
      in this direction are fast disappearing. Middle-aged persons alone can
      remember to have seen the great holes in the rue Montmartre, rue du
      Temple, etc., down which the waters poured. Those terrible open jaws were
      in the olden time of immense benefit to Paris. Their place will probably
      be forever marked by the sudden rise of the paved roadways at the spots
      where they opened,&mdash;another archaeological detail which will be quite
      inexplicable to the historian two centuries hence. One day, about 1816, a
      little girl who was carrying a case of diamonds to an actress at the
      Ambigu, for her part as queen, was overtaken by a shower and so nearly
      washed down the great drainhole in the rue du Temple that she would have
      disappeared had it not been for a passer who heard her cries. Unluckily,
      she had let go the diamonds, which were, however, recovered later at a
      man-hole. This event made a great noise, and gave rise to many petitions
      against these engulfers of water and little girls. They were singular
      constructions about five feet high, furnished with iron railings, more or
      less movable, which often caused the inundation of the neighboring
      cellars, whenever the artificial river produced by sudden rains was
      arrested in its course by the filth and refuse collected about these
      railings, which the owners of the abutting houses sometimes forgot to
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of this shop of the Sieur Lecamus was all window, formed of
      sashes of leaded panes, which made the interior very dark. The furs were
      taken for selection to the houses of rich customers. As for those who came
      to the shop to buy, the goods were shown to them outside, between the
      pillars,&mdash;the arcade being, let us remark, encumbered during the
      day-time with tables, and clerks sitting on stools, such as we all
      remember seeing some fifteen years ago under the &ldquo;piliers des Halles.&rdquo;
       From these outposts, the clerks and apprentices talked, questioned,
      answered each other, and called to the passers,&mdash;customs which the
      great Walter Scott has made use of in his &ldquo;Fortunes of Nigel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sign, which represented an ermine, hung outside, as we still see in
      some village hostelries, from a rich bracket of gilded iron filagree.
      Above the ermine, on one side of the sign, were the words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 LECAMVS

                 FURRIER
</pre>
    <h3>
      TO MADAME LA ROYNE ET DU ROY NOSTRE SIRE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the other side of the sign were the words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         TO MADAME LA ROYNE-MERE

       AND MESSIEURS DV PARLEMENT.
</pre>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;Madame la Royne-mere&rdquo; had been lately added. The gilding was
      fresh. This addition showed the recent changes produced by the sudden and
      violent death of Henri II., which overturned many fortunes at court and
      began that of the Guises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-shop opened on the river. In this room usually sat the
      respectable proprietor himself and Mademoiselle Lecamus. In those days the
      wife of a man who was not noble had no right to the title of dame,
      &ldquo;madame&rdquo;; but the wives of the burghers of Paris were allowed to use that
      of &ldquo;mademoiselle,&rdquo; in virtue of privileges granted and confirmed to their
      husbands by the several kings to whom they had done service. Between this
      back-shop and the main shop was the well of a corkscrew-staircase which
      gave access to the upper story, where were the great ware-room and the
      dwelling-rooms of the old couple, and the garrets lighted by skylights,
      where slept the children, the servant-woman, the apprentices, and the
      clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This crowding of families, servants, and apprentices, the little space
      which each took up in the building where the apprentices all slept in one
      large chamber under the roof, explains the enormous population of Paris
      then agglomerated on one-tenth of the surface of the present city; also
      the queer details of private life in the middle ages; also, the
      contrivances of love which, with all due deference to historians, are
      found only in the pages of the romance-writers, without whom they would be
      lost to the world. At this period very great <i>seigneurs</i>, such, for
      instance, as Admiral de Coligny, occupied three rooms, and their suites
      lived at some neighboring inn. There were not, in those days, more than
      fifty private mansions in Paris, and those were fifty palaces belonging to
      sovereign princes, or to great vassals, whose way of living was superior
      to that of the greatest German rulers, such as the Duke of Bavaria and the
      Elector of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen of the Lecamus family was beneath the back-shop and looked out
      upon the river. It had a glass door opening upon a sort of iron balcony,
      from which the cook drew up water in a bucket, and where the household
      washing was done. The back-shop was made the dining-room, office, and
      salon of the merchant. In this important room (in all such houses richly
      panelled and adorned with some special work of art, and also a carved
      chest) the life of the merchant was passed; there the joyous suppers after
      the work of the day was over, there the secret conferences on the
      political interests of the burghers and of royalty took place. The
      formidable corporations of Paris were at that time able to arm a hundred
      thousand men. Therefore the opinions of the merchants were backed by their
      servants, their clerks, their apprentices, their workmen. The burghers had
      a chief in the &ldquo;provost of the merchants&rdquo; who commanded them, and in the
      Hotel de Ville, a palace where they possessed the right to assemble. In
      the famous &ldquo;burghers&rsquo; parlor&rdquo; their solemn deliberations took place. Had
      it not been for the continual sacrifices which by that time made war
      intolerable to the corporations, who were weary of their losses and of the
      famine, Henri IV., that factionist who became king, might never perhaps
      have entered Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one can now picture to himself the appearance of this corner of old
      Paris, where the bridge and quai still are, where the trees of the quai
      aux Fleurs now stand, but where no trace remains of the period of which we
      write except the tall and famous tower of the Palais de Justice, from
      which the signal was given for the Saint Bartholomew. Strange
      circumstance! one of the houses standing at the foot of that tower then
      surrounded by wooden shops, that, namely, of Lecamus, was about to witness
      the birth of facts which were destined to prepare for that night of
      massacre, which was, unhappily, more favorable than fatal to Calvinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when our history begins, the audacity of the new religious
      doctrines was putting all Paris in a ferment. A Scotchman named Stuart had
      just assassinated President Minard, the member of the Parliament to whom
      public opinion attributed the largest share in the execution of Councillor
      Anne du Bourg; who was burned on the place de Greve after the king&rsquo;s
      tailor&mdash;to whom Henri II. and Diane de Poitiers had caused the
      torture of the &ldquo;question&rdquo; to be applied in their very presence. Paris was
      so closely watched that the archers compelled all passers along the street
      to pray before the shrines of the Madonna so as to discover heretics by
      their unwillingness or even refusal to do an act contrary to their
      beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two archers who were stationed at the corner of the Lecamus house had
      departed, and Cristophe, son of the furrier, vehemently suspected of
      deserting Catholicism, was able to leave the shop without fear of being
      made to adore the Virgin. By seven in the evening, in April, 1560,
      darkness was already falling, and the apprentices, seeing no signs of
      customers on either side of the arcade, were beginning to take in the
      merchandise exposed as samples beneath the pillars, in order to close the
      shop. Christophe Lecamus, an ardent young man about twenty-two years old,
      was standing on the sill of the shop-door, apparently watching the
      apprentices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said one of them, addressing Christophe and pointing to a man
      who was walking to and fro under the gallery with an air of indecision,
      &ldquo;perhaps that&rsquo;s a thief or a spy; anyhow, the shabby wretch can&rsquo;t be an
      honest man; if he wanted to speak to us he would come over frankly,
      instead of sidling along as he does&mdash;and what a face!&rdquo; continued the
      apprentice, mimicking the man, &ldquo;with his nose in his cloak, his yellow
      eyes, and that famished look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the stranger thus described caught sight of Christophe alone on the
      door-sill, he suddenly left the opposite gallery where he was then
      walking, crossed the street rapidly, and came under the arcade in front of
      the Lecamus house. There he passed slowly along in front of the shop, and
      before the apprentices returned to close the outer shutters he said to
      Christophe in a low voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Chaudieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the name of one of the most illustrious ministers and devoted
      actors in the terrible drama called &ldquo;The Reformation,&rdquo; Christophe quivered
      as a faithful peasant might have quivered on recognizing his disguised
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to see some furs? Though it is almost dark I will
      show you some myself,&rdquo; said Christophe, wishing to throw the apprentices,
      whom he heard behind him, off the scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of his hand he invited the minister to enter the shop, but the
      latter replied that he preferred to converse outside. Christophe then
      fetched his cap and followed the disciple of Calvin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though banished by an edict, Chaudieu, the secret envoy of Theodore de
      Beze and Calvin (who were directing the French Reformation from Geneva),
      went and came, risking the cruel punishment to which the Parliament, in
      unison with the Church and Royalty, had condemned one of their number, the
      celebrated Anne du Bourg, in order to make a terrible example. Chaudieu,
      whose brother was a captain and one of Admiral Coligny&rsquo;s best soldiers,
      was a powerful auxiliary by whose arm Calvin shook France at the beginning
      of the twenty two years of religious warfare now on the point of breaking
      out. This minister was one of the hidden wheels whose movements can best
      exhibit the wide-spread action of the Reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaudieu led Christophe to the water&rsquo;s edge through an underground
      passage, which was like that of the Marion tunnel filled up by the
      authorities about ten years ago. This passage, which was situated between
      the Lecamus house and the one adjoining it, ran under the rue de la
      Vieille-Pelleterie, and was called the Pont-aux-Fourreurs. It was used by
      the dyers of the City to go to the river and wash their flax and silks,
      and other stuffs. A little boat was at the entrance of it, rowed by a
      single sailor. In the bow was a man unknown to Christophe, a man of low
      stature and very simply dressed. Chaudieu and Christophe entered the boat,
      which in a moment was in the middle of the Seine; the sailor then directed
      its course beneath one of the wooden arches of the pont au Change, where
      he tied up quickly to an iron ring. As yet, no one had said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we can speak without fear; there are no traitors or spies here,&rdquo;
       said Chaudieu, looking at the two as yet unnamed men. Then, turning an
      ardent face to Christophe, &ldquo;Are you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;full of that devotion that
      should animate a martyr? Are you ready to endure all for our sacred cause?
      Do you fear the tortures applied to the Councillor du Bourg, to the king&rsquo;s
      tailor,&mdash;tortures which await the majority of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall confess the gospel,&rdquo; replied Lecamus, simply, looking at the
      windows of his father&rsquo;s back-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family lamp, standing on the table where his father was making up his
      books for the day, spoke to him, no doubt, of the joys of family and the
      peaceful existence which he now renounced. The vision was rapid, but
      complete. His mind took in, at a glance, the burgher quarter full of its
      own harmonies, where his happy childhood had been spent, where lived his
      promised bride, Babette Lallier, where all things promised him a sweet and
      full existence; he saw the past; he saw the future, and he sacrificed it,
      or, at any rate, he staked it all. Such were the men of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need ask no more,&rdquo; said the impetuous sailor; &ldquo;we know him for one of
      our <i>saints</i>. If the Scotchman had not done the deed he would kill us
      that infamous Minard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lecamus, &ldquo;my life belongs to the church; I shall give it with
      joy for the triumph of the Reformation, on which I have seriously
      reflected. I know that what we do is for the happiness of the peoples. In
      two words: Popery drives to celibacy, the Reformation establishes the
      family. It is time to rid France of her monks, to restore their lands to
      the Crown, who will, sooner or later, sell them to the burghers. Let us
      learn to die for our children, and make our families some day free and
      prosperous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the young enthusiast, that of Chaudieu, that of the sailor,
      that of the stranger seated in the bow, lighted by the last gleams of the
      twilight, formed a picture which ought the more to be described because
      the description contains in itself the whole history of the times&mdash;if
      it is, indeed, true that to certain men it is given to sum up in their own
      persons the spirit of their age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The religious reform undertaken by Luther in Germany, John Knox in
      Scotland, Calvin in France, took hold especially of those minds in the
      lower classes into which thought had penetrated. The great lords sustained
      the movement only to serve interests that were foreign to the religious
      cause. To these two classes were added adventurers, ruined noblemen,
      younger sons, to whom all troubles were equally acceptable. But among the
      artisan and merchant classes the new faith was sincere and based on
      calculation. The masses of the poorer people adhered at once to a religion
      which gave the ecclesiastical property to the State, and deprived the
      dignitaries of the Church of their enormous revenues. Commerce everywhere
      reckoned up the profits of this religious operation, and devoted itself
      body, soul, and purse, to the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But among the young men of the French bourgeoisie the Protestant movement
      found that noble inclination to sacrifices of all kinds which inspires
      youth, to which selfishness is, as yet, unknown. Eminent men, sagacious
      minds, discerned the Republic in the Reformation; they desired to
      establish throughout Europe the government of the United Provinces, which
      ended by triumphing over the greatest Power of those times,&mdash;Spain,
      under Philip the Second, represented in the Low Countries by the Duke of
      Alba. Jean Hotoman was then meditating his famous book, in which this
      project is put forth,&mdash;a book which spread throughout France the
      leaven of these ideas, which were stirred up anew by the Ligue, repressed
      by Richelieu, then by Louis XIV., always protected by the younger
      branches, by the house of Orleans in 1789, as by the house of Bourbon in
      1589. Whoso says &ldquo;Investigate&rdquo; says &ldquo;Revolt.&rdquo; All revolt is either the
      cloak that hides a prince, or the swaddling-clothes of a new mastery. The
      house of Bourbon, the younger sons of the Valois, were at work beneath the
      surface of the Reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when the little boat floated beneath the arch of the pont au
      Change the question was strangely complicated by the ambitions of the
      Guises, who were rivalling the Bourbons. Thus the Crown, represented by
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, was able to sustain the struggle for thirty years by
      pitting the one house against the other house; whereas later, the Crown,
      instead of standing between various jealous ambitions, found itself
      without a barrier, face to face with the people: Richelieu and Louis XIV.
      had broken down the barrier of the Nobility; Louis XV. had broken down
      that of the Parliaments. Alone before the people, as Louis XVI. was, a
      king must inevitably succumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe Lecamus was a fine representative of the ardent and devoted
      portion of the people. His wan face had the sharp hectic tones which
      distinguish certain fair complexions; his hair was yellow, of a coppery
      shade; his gray-blue eyes were sparkling. In them alone was his fine soul
      visible; for his ill-proportioned face did not atone for its triangular
      shape by the noble mien of an elevated mind, and his low forehead
      indicated only extreme energy. Life seemed to centre in his chest, which
      was rather hollow. More nervous than sanguine, Cristophe&rsquo;s bodily
      appearance was thin and threadlike, but wiry. His pointed noise expressed
      the shrewdness of the people, and his countenance revealed an intelligence
      capable of conducting itself well on a single point of the circumference,
      without having the faculty of seeing all around it. His eyes, the arching
      brows of which, scarcely covered with a whitish down, projected like an
      awning, were strongly circled by a pale-blue band, the skin being white
      and shining at the spring of the nose,&mdash;a sign which almost always
      denotes excessive enthusiasm. Christophe was of the people,&mdash;the
      people who devote themselves, who fight for their devotions, who let
      themselves be inveigled and betrayed; intelligent enough to comprehend and
      serve an idea, too upright to turn it to his own account, too noble to
      sell himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrasting with this son of Lecamus, Chaudieu, the ardent minister, with
      brown hair thinned by vigils, a yellow skin, an eloquent mouth, a militant
      brow, with flaming brown eyes, and a short and prominent chin, embodied
      well the Christian faith which brought to the Reformation so many sincere
      and fanatical pastors, whose courage and spirit aroused the populations.
      The aide-de-camp of Calvin and Theodore de Beze contrasted admirably with
      the son of the furrier. He represented the fiery cause of which the effect
      was seen in Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, an impetuous being, tanned by the open air, accustomed to dewy
      nights and burning days, with closed lips, hasty gestures, orange eyes,
      ravenous as those of a vulture, and black, frizzled hair, was the
      embodiment of an adventurer who risks all in a venture, as a gambler
      stakes all on a card. His whole appearance revealed terrific passions, and
      an audacity that flinched at nothing. His vigorous muscles were made to be
      quiescent as well as to act. His manner was more audacious than noble. His
      nose, though thin, turned up and snuffed battle. He seemed agile and
      capable. You would have known him in all ages for the leader of a party.
      If he were not of the Reformation, he might have been Pizarro, Fernando
      Cortez, or Morgan the Exterminator,&mdash;a man of violent action of some
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth man, sitting on a thwart wrapped in his cloak, belonged,
      evidently, to the highest portion of society. The fineness of his linen,
      its cut, the material and scent of his clothing, the style and skin of his
      gloves, showed him to be a man of courts, just as his bearing, his
      haughtiness, his composure and his all-embracing glance proved him to be a
      man of war. The aspect of this personage made a spectator uneasy in the
      first place, and then inclined him to respect. We respect a man who
      respects himself. Though short and deformed, his manners instantly
      redeemed the disadvantages of his figure. The ice once broken, he showed a
      lively rapidity of decision, with an indefinable dash and fire which made
      him seem affable and winning. He had the blue eyes and the curved nose of
      the house of Navarre, and the Spanish cut of the marked features which
      were in after days the type of the Bourbon kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the scene now assumed a startling interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, as young Lecamus ended his speech, &ldquo;this boatman is
      La Renaudie. And here is Monsiegneur the Prince de Conde,&rdquo; he added,
      motioning to the deformed little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus these four men represented the faith of the people, the spirit of the
      Scriptures, the mailed hand of the soldier, and royalty itself hidden in
      that dark shadow of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall now know what we expect of you,&rdquo; resumed the minister, after
      allowing a short pause for Christophe&rsquo;s astonishment. &ldquo;In order that you
      may make no mistake, we feel obliged to initiate you into the most
      important secrets of the Reformation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince and La Renaudie emphasized the minister&rsquo;s speech by a gesture,
      the latter having paused to allow the prince to speak, if he so wished.
      Like all great men engaged in plotting, whose system it is to conceal
      their hand until the decisive moment, the prince kept silence&mdash;but
      not from cowardice. In these crises he was always the soul of the
      conspiracy; recoiling from no danger and ready to risk his own head; but
      from a sort of royal dignity he left the explanation of the enterprise to
      his minister, and contented himself with studying the new instrument he
      was about to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, in the Huguenot style of address, &ldquo;we are about
      to do battle for the first time with the Roman prostitute. In a few days
      either our legions will be dying on the scaffold, or the Guises will be
      dead. This is the first call to arms on behalf of our religion in France,
      and France will not lay down those arms till they have conquered. The
      question, mark you this, concerns the nation, not the kingdom. The
      majority of the nobles of the kingdom see plainly what the Cardinal de
      Lorraine and his brother are seeking. Under pretext of defending the
      Catholic religion, the house of Lorraine means to claim the crown of
      France as its patrimony. Relying on the Church, it has made the Church a
      formidable ally; the monks are its support, its acolytes, its spies. It
      has assumed the post of guardian to the throne it is seeking to usurp; it
      protects the house of Valois which it means to destroy. We have decided to
      take up arms because the liberties of the people and the interests of the
      nobles are equally threatened. Let us smother at its birth a faction as
      odious as that of the Burgundians who formerly put Paris and all France to
      fire and sword. It required a Louis XI. to put a stop to the quarrel
      between the Burgundians and the Crown; and to-day a prince de Conde is
      needed to prevent the house of Lorraine from re-attempting that struggle.
      This is not a civil war; it is a duel between the Guises and the
      Reformation,&mdash;a duel to the death! We will make their heads fall, or
      they shall have ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this crisis, Christophe,&rdquo; said La Renaudie, &ldquo;we mean to neglect
      nothing which shall strengthen our party,&mdash;for there is a party in
      the Reformation, the party of thwarted interests, of nobles sacrificed to
      the Lorrains, of old captains shamefully treated at Fontainebleau, from
      which the cardinal has banished them by setting up gibbets on which to
      hang those who ask the king for the cost of their equipment and their
      back-pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, my child,&rdquo; resumed Chaudieu, observing a sort of terror in
      Christophe, &ldquo;this it is which compels us to conquer by arms instead of
      conquering by conviction and by martyrdom. The queen-mother is on the
      point of entering into our views. Not that she means to abjure; she has
      not reached that decision as yet; but she may be forced to it by our
      triumph. However that may be, Queen Catherine, humiliated and in despair
      at seeing the power she expected to wield on the death of the king passing
      into the hands of the Guises, alarmed at the empire of the young queen,
      Mary, niece of the Lorrains and their auxiliary, Queen Catherine is
      doubtless inclined to lend her support to the princes and lords who are
      now about to make an attempt which will deliver her from the Guises. At
      this moment, devoted as she may seem to them, she hates them; she desires
      their overthrow, and will try to make use of us against them; but
      Monseigneur the Prince de Conde intends to make use of her against all.
      The queen-mother will, undoubtedly, consent to all our plans. We shall
      have the Connetable on our side; Monseigneur has just been to see him at
      Chantilly; but he does not wish to move without an order from his masters.
      Being the uncle of Monseigneur, he will not leave him in the lurch; and
      this generous prince does not hesitate to fling himself into danger to
      force Anne de Montmorency to a decision. All is prepared, and we have cast
      our eyes on you as the means of communicating to Queen Catherine our
      treaty of alliance, the drafts of edicts, and the bases of the new
      government. The court is at Blois. Many of our friends are with it; but
      they are to be our future chiefs, and, like Monseigneur,&rdquo; he added,
      motioning to the prince, &ldquo;they must not be suspected. The queen-mother and
      our friends are so closely watched that it is impossible to employ as
      intermediary any known person of importance; they would instantly be
      suspected and kept from communicating with Madame Catherine. God sends us
      at this crisis the shepherd David and his sling to do battle with Goliath
      of Guise. Your father, unfortunately for him a good Catholic, is furrier
      to the two queens. He is constantly supplying them with garments. Get him
      to send you on some errand to the court. You will excite no suspicion, and
      you cannot compromise Queen Catherine in any way. All our leaders would
      lose their heads if a single imprudent act allowed their connivance with
      the queen-mother to be seen. Where a great lord, if discovered, would give
      the alarm and destroy our chances, an insignificant man like you will pass
      unnoticed. See! The Guises keep the town so full of spies that we have
      only the river where we can talk without fear. You are now, my son, like a
      sentinel who must die at his post. Remember this: if you are discovered,
      we shall all abandon you; we shall even cast, if necessary, opprobrium and
      infamy upon you. We shall say that you are a creature of the Guises, made
      to play this part to ruin us. You see therefore that we ask of you a total
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you perish,&rdquo; said the Prince de Conde, &ldquo;I pledge my honor as a noble
      that your family shall be sacred for the house of Navarre; I will bear it
      on my heart and serve it in all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those words, my prince, suffice,&rdquo; replied Christophe, without reflecting
      that the conspirator was a Gascon. &ldquo;We live in times when each man, prince
      or burgher, must do his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There speaks the true Huguenot. If all our men were like that,&rdquo; said La
      Renaudie, laying his hand on Christophe&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;we should be
      conquerors to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; resumed the prince, &ldquo;I desire to show you that if Chaudieu
      preaches, if the nobleman goes armed, the prince fights. Therefore, in
      this hot game all stakes are played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; said La Renaudie. &ldquo;I will not give you the papers
      until you reach Beaugency; for they must not be risked during the whole of
      your journey. You will find me waiting for you there on the wharf; my
      face, voice, and clothes will be so changed you cannot recognize me, but I
      shall say to you, &lsquo;Are you a <i>guepin</i>?&rsquo; and you will answer, &lsquo;Ready
      to serve.&rsquo; As to the performance of your mission, these are the means: You
      will find a horse at the &lsquo;Pinte Fleurie,&rsquo; close to Saint-Germain
      l&rsquo;Auxerrois. You will there ask for Jean le Breton, who will take you to
      the stable and give you one of my ponies which is known to do thirty
      leagues in eight hours. Leave by the gate of Bussy. Breton has a pass for
      me; use it yourself, and make your way by skirting the towns. You can thus
      reach Orleans by daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the horse?&rdquo; said young Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not give out till you reach Orleans,&rdquo; replied La Renaudie. &ldquo;Leave
      him at the entrance of the faubourg Bannier; for the gates are well
      guarded, and you must not excite suspicion. It is for you, friend, to play
      your part intelligently. You must invent whatever fable seems to you best
      to reach the third house to the left on entering Orleans; it belongs to a
      certain Tourillon, glove-maker. Strike three blows on the door, and call
      out: &lsquo;On service from Messieurs de Guise!&rsquo; The man will appear to be a
      rabid Guisist; no one knows but our four selves that he is one of us. He
      will give you a faithful boatman,&mdash;another Guisist of his own cut. Go
      down at once to the wharf, and embark in a boat painted green and edged
      with white. You will doubtless land at Beaugency to-morrow about mid-day.
      There I will arrange to find you a boat which will take you to Blois
      without running any risk. Our enemies the Guises do not watch the rivers,
      only the landings. Thus you will be able to see the queen-mother to-morrow
      or the day after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are written there,&rdquo; said Christophe, touching his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaudieu embraced his child with singular religious effusion; he was proud
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God keep thee!&rdquo; he said, pointing to the ruddy light of the sinking sun,
      which was touching the old roofs covered with shingles and sending its
      gleams slantwise through the forest of piles among which the water was
      rippling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong to the race of the Jacques Bonhomme,&rdquo; said La Renaudie,
      pressing Christophe&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall meet again, <i>monsieur</i>,&rdquo; said the prince, with a gesture of
      infinite grace, in which there was something that seemed almost
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a stroke of his oars La Renaudie put the boat at the lower step of
      the stairway which led to the house. Christophe landed, and the boat
      disappeared instantly beneath the arches of the pont au Change.

      II. THE BURGHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Christophe shook the iron railing which closed the stairway on the river,
      and called. His mother heard him, opened one of the windows of the back
      shop, and asked what he was doing there. Christophe answered that he was
      cold and wanted to get in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my master,&rdquo; said the Burgundian maid, &ldquo;you went out by the
      street-door, and you return by the water-gate. Your father will be fine
      and angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christophe, bewildered by a confidence which had just brought him into
      communication with the Prince de Conde, La Renaudie, and Chaudieu, and
      still more moved at the prospect of impending civil war, made no answer;
      he ran hastily up from the kitchen to the back shop; but his mother, a
      rabid Catholic, could not control her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager those three men I saw you talking with are Ref&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, wife!&rdquo; said the cautious old man with white hair who
      was turning over a thick ledger. &ldquo;You dawdling fellows,&rdquo; he went on,
      addressing three journeymen, who had long finished their suppers, &ldquo;why
      don&rsquo;t you go to bed? It is eight o&rsquo;clock, and you have to be up at five;
      besides, you must carry home to-night President de Thou&rsquo;s cap and mantle.
      All three of you had better go, and take your sticks and rapiers; and
      then, if you meet scamps like yourselves, at least you&rsquo;ll be in force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to take the ermine surcoat the young queen has ordered to be
      sent to the hotel des Soissons? there&rsquo;s an express going from there to
      Blois for the queen-mother,&rdquo; said one of the clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;the queen-mother&rsquo;s bill amounts to three thousand
      crowns; it is time to get the money, and I am going to Blois myself very
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I do not think it right at your age and in these dangerous times
      to expose yourself on the high-roads. I am twenty-two years old, and you
      ought to employ me on such errands,&rdquo; said Christophe, eyeing the box which
      he supposed contained the surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glued to your seats?&rdquo; cried the old man to his apprentices, who
      at once jumped up and seized their rapiers, cloaks, and Monsieur de Thou&rsquo;s
      furs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the Parliament was to receive in state, as its president,
      this illustrious judge, who, after signing the death warrant of Councillor
      du Bourg, was destined before the close of the year to sit in judgment on
      the Prince de Conde!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said the old man, calling to the maid, &ldquo;go and ask friend Lallier
      if he will come and sup with us and bring the wine; we&rsquo;ll furnish the
      victuals. Tell him, above all, to bring his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus, the syndic of the guild of furriers, was a handsome old man of
      sixty, with white hair, and a broad, open brow. As court furrier for the
      last forty years, he had witnessed all the revolutions of the reign of
      Francois I. He had seen the arrival at the French court of the young girl
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, then scarcely fifteen years of age. He had observed
      her giving way before the Duchesse d&rsquo;Etampes, her father-in-law&rsquo;s
      mistress; giving way before the Duchesse de Valentinois, the mistress of
      her husband the late king. But the furrier had brought himself safely
      through all the chances and changes by which court merchants were often
      involved in the disgrace and overthrow of mistresses. His caution led to
      his good luck. He maintained an attitude of extreme humility. Pride had
      never caught him in its toils. He made himself so small, so gentle, so
      compliant, of so little account at court and before the queens and
      princesses and favorites, that this modesty, combined with good-humor, had
      kept the royal sign above his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a policy was, of course, indicative of a shrewd and perspicacious
      mind. Humble as Lecamus seemed to the outer world, he was despotic in his
      own home; there he was an autocrat. Most respected and honored by his
      brother craftsmen, he owed to his long possession of the first place in
      the trade much of the consideration that was shown to him. He was,
      besides, very willing to do kindnesses to others, and among the many
      services he had rendered, none was more striking than the assistance he
      had long given to the greatest surgeon of the sixteenth century, Ambroise
      Pare, who owed to him the possibility of studying for his profession. In
      all the difficulties which came up among the merchants Lecamus was always
      conciliating. Thus a general good opinion of him consolidated his position
      among his equals; while his borrowed characteristics kept him steadily in
      favor with the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only this, but having intrigued for the honor of being on the vestry
      of his parish church, he did what was necessary to bring him into the odor
      of sanctity with the rector of Saint-Pierre aux Boeufs, who looked upon
      him as one of the men most devoted to the Catholic religion in Paris.
      Consequently, at the time of the convocation of the States-General he was
      unanimously elected to represent the <i>tiers etat</i> through the
      influence of the clergy of Paris,&mdash;an influence which at that period
      was immense. This old man was, in short, one of those secretly ambitious
      souls who will bend for fifty years before all the world, gliding from
      office to office, no one exactly knowing how it came about that he was
      found securely and peacefully seated at last where no man, even the
      boldest, would have had the ambition at the beginning of life to fancy
      himself; so great was the distance, so many the gulfs and the precipices
      to cross! Lecamus, who had immense concealed wealth, would not run any
      risks, and was silently preparing a brilliant future for his son. Instead
      of having the personal ambition which sacrifices the future to the
      present, he had family ambition,&mdash;a lost sentiment in our time, a
      sentiment suppressed by the folly of our laws of inheritance. Lecamus saw
      himself first president of the Parliament of Paris in the person of his
      grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe, godson of the famous historian de Thou, was given a most solid
      education; but it had led him to doubt and to the spirit of examination
      which was then affecting both the Faculties and the students of the
      universities. Christophe was, at the period of which we are now writing,
      pursuing his studies for the bar, that first step toward the magistracy.
      The old furrier was pretending to some hesitation as to his son. Sometimes
      he seemed to wish to make Christophe his successor; then again he spoke of
      him as a lawyer; but in his heart he was ambitious of a place for this son
      as Councillor of the Parliament. He wanted to put the Lecamus family on a
      level with those old and celebrated burgher families from which came the
      Pasquiers, the Moles, the Mirons, the Seguiers, Lamoignon, du Tillet,
      Lecoigneux, Lescalopier, Goix, Arnauld, those famous sheriffs and
      grand-provosts of the merchants, among whom the throne found such strong
      defenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in order that Christophe might in due course of time maintain
      his rank, he wished to marry him to the daughter of the richest jeweller
      in the city, his friend Lallier, whose nephew was destined to present to
      Henri IV. the keys of Paris. The strongest desire rooted in the heart of
      the worthy burgher was to use half of his fortune and half of that of the
      jeweller in the purchase of a large and beautiful seignorial estate,
      which, in those days, was a long and very difficult affair. But his shrewd
      mind knew the age in which he lived too well to be ignorant of the great
      movements which were now in preparation. He saw clearly, and he saw
      justly, and knew that the kingdom was about to be divided into two camps.
      The useless executions in the Place de l&rsquo;Estrapade, that of the king&rsquo;s
      tailor and the more recent one of the Councillor Anne du Bourg, the actual
      connivance of the great lords, and that of the favorite of Francois I.
      with the Reformers, were terrible indications. The furrier resolved to
      remain, whatever happened, Catholic, royalist, and parliamentarian; but it
      suited him, privately, that Christophe should belong to the Reformation.
      He knew he was rich enough to ransom his son if Christophe was too much
      compromised; and on the other hand if France became Calvinist his son
      could save the family in the event of one of those furious Parisian riots,
      the memory of which was ever-living with the bourgeoisie,&mdash;riots they
      were destined to see renewed through four reigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these thoughts the old furrier, like Louis XI., did not even say to
      himself; his wariness went so far as to deceive his wife and son. This
      grave personage had long been the chief man of the richest and most
      populous quarter of Paris, that of the centre, under the title of <i>quartenier</i>,&mdash;the
      title and office which became so celebrated some fifteen months later.
      Clothed in cloth like all the prudent burghers who obeyed the sumptuary
      laws, Sieur Lecamus (he was tenacious of that title which Charles V.
      granted to the burghers of Paris, permitting them also to buy baronial
      estates and call their wives by the fine name of <i>demoiselle</i>, but
      not by that of madame) wore neither gold chains nor silk, but always a
      good doublet with large tarnished silver buttons, cloth gaiters mounting
      to the knee, and leather shoes with clasps. His shirt, of fine linen,
      showed, according to the fashion of the time, in great puffs between his
      half-opened jacket and his breeches. Though his large and handsome face
      received the full light of the lamp standing on the table, Christophe had
      no conception of the thoughts which lay buried beneath the rich and florid
      Dutch skin of the old man; but he understood well enough the advantage he
      himself had expected to obtain from his affection for pretty Babette
      Lallier. So Christophe, with the air of a man who had come to a decision,
      smiled bitterly as he heard of the invitation to his promised bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Burgundian cook and the apprentices had departed on their several
      errands, old Lecamus looked at his wife with a glance which showed the
      firmness and resolution of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be satisfied till you have got that boy hanged with your
      damned tongue,&rdquo; he said, in a stern voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather see him hanged and saved than living and a Huguenot,&rdquo; she
      answered, gloomily. &ldquo;To think that a child whom I carried nine months in
      my womb should be a bad Catholic, and be doomed to hell for all eternity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old silly,&rdquo; said the furrier; &ldquo;let him live, if only to convert him. You
      said, before the apprentices, a word which may set fire to our house, and
      roast us all, like fleas in a straw bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother crossed herself, and sat down silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, you,&rdquo; said the old man, with a judicial glance at his son,
      &ldquo;explain to me what you were doing on the river with&mdash;come closer,
      that I may speak to you,&rdquo; he added, grasping his son by the arm, and
      drawing him to him&mdash;&ldquo;with the Prince de Conde,&rdquo; he whispered.
      Christophe trembled. &ldquo;Do you suppose the court furrier does not know every
      face that frequents the palace? Think you I am ignorant of what is going
      on? Monseigneur the Grand Master has been giving orders to send troops to
      Amboise. Withdrawing troops from Paris to send them to Amboise when the
      king is at Blois, and making them march through Chartres and Vendome,
      instead of going by Orleans&mdash;isn&rsquo;t the meaning of that clear enough?
      There&rsquo;ll be troubles. If the queens want their surcoats, they must send
      for them. The Prince de Conde has perhaps made up his mind to kill
      Messieurs de Guise; who, on their side, expect to rid themselves of him.
      The prince will use the Huguenots to protect himself. Why should the son
      of a furrier get himself into that fray? When you are married, and when
      you are councillor to the Parliament, you will be as prudent as your
      father. Before belonging to the new religion, the son of a furrier ought
      to wait until the rest of the world belongs to it. I don&rsquo;t condemn the
      Reformers; it is not my business to do so; but the court is Catholic, the
      two queens are Catholic, the Parliament is Catholic; we must supply them
      with furs, and therefore we must be Catholic ourselves. You shall not go
      out from here, Christophe; if you do, I will send you to your godfather,
      President de Thou, who will keep you night and day blackening paper,
      instead of blackening your soul in company with those damned Genevese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Christophe, leaning upon the back of the old man&rsquo;s chair,
      &ldquo;send me to Blois to carry that surcoat to Queen Mary and get our money
      from the queen-mother. If you do not, I am lost; and you care for your
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; repeated the old man, without showing the least surprise. &ldquo;If you
      stay here you can&rsquo;t be lost; I shall have my eye on you all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will kill me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most powerful among the Huguenots have cast their eyes on me to serve
      them in a certain matter; if I fail to do what I have just promised to do,
      they will kill me in open day, here in the street, as they killed Minard.
      But if you send me to court on your affairs, perhaps I can justify myself
      equally well to both sides. Either I shall succeed without having run any
      danger at all, and shall then win a fine position in the party; or, if the
      danger turns out very great, I shall be there simply on your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father rose as if his chair was of red-hot iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leave us; and watch that we are left quite alone,
      Christophe and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mademoiselle Lecamus had left them the furrier took his son by a
      button and led him to the corner of the room which made the angle of the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christophe,&rdquo; he said, whispering in his ear as he had done when he
      mentioned the name of the Prince of Conde, &ldquo;be a Huguenot, if you have
      that vice; but be so cautiously, in the depths of your soul, and not in a
      way to be pointed at as a heretic throughout the quarter. What you have
      just confessed to me shows that the leaders have confidence in you. What
      are you going to do for them at court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you that,&rdquo; replied Christophe; &ldquo;for I do not know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! hum!&rdquo; muttered the old man, looking at his son, &ldquo;the scamp means to
      hoodwink his father; he&rsquo;ll go far. You are not going to court,&rdquo; he went on
      in a low tone, &ldquo;to carry remittances to Messieurs de Guise or to the
      little king our master, or to the little Queen Marie. All those hearts are
      Catholic; but I would take my oath the Italian woman has some spite
      against the Scotch girl and against the Lorrains. I know her. She has a
      desperate desire to put her hand into the dough. The late king was so
      afraid of her that he did as the jewellers do, he cut diamond by diamond,
      he pitted one woman against another. That caused Queen Catherine&rsquo;s hatred
      to the poor Duchesse de Valentinois, from whom she took the beautiful
      chateau of Chenonceaux. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the Connetable, the duchess
      might have been strangled. Back, back, my son; don&rsquo;t put yourself in the
      hands of that Italian, who has no passion except in her brain; and that&rsquo;s
      a bad kind of woman! Yes, what they are sending you to do at court may
      give you a very bad headache,&rdquo; cried the father, seeing that Christophe
      was about to reply. &ldquo;My son, I have plans for your future which you will
      not upset by making yourself useful to Queen Catherine; but, heavens and
      earth! don&rsquo;t risk your head. Messieurs de Guise would cut it off as easily
      as the Burgundian cuts a turnip, and then those persons who are now
      employing you will disown you utterly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, father,&rdquo; said Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you really so strong, my son? You know it, and are willing to
      risk all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the powers above us!&rdquo; cried the father, pressing his son in his arms,
      &ldquo;we can understand each other; you are worthy of your father. My child,
      you&rsquo;ll be the honor of the family, and I see that your old father can
      speak plainly with you. But do not be more Huguenot than Messieurs de
      Coligny. Never draw your sword; be a pen man; keep to your future role of
      lawyer. Now, then, tell me nothing until after you have succeeded. If I do
      not hear from you by the fourth day after you reach Blois, that silence
      will tell me that you are in some danger. The old man will go to save the
      young one. I have not sold furs for thirty-two years without a good
      knowledge of the wrong side of court robes. I have the means of making my
      way through many doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christophe opened his eyes very wide as he heard his father talking thus;
      but he thought there might be some parental trap in it, and he made no
      reply further than to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, make out the bill, and write a letter to the queen; I must start at
      once, or the greatest misfortunes may happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall buy a horse. Write at once, in God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! mother! give your son some money,&rdquo; cried the furrier to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother returned, went to her chest, took out a purse of gold, and gave
      it to Christophe, who kissed her with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bill was all ready,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;here it is. I will write the
      letter at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christophe took the bill and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will sup with us, at any rate,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;In such a
      crisis you ought to exchange rings with Lallier&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will go and fetch her,&rdquo; said Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was distrustful of his father&rsquo;s stability in the matter. The
      old man&rsquo;s character was not yet fully known to him. He ran up to his room,
      dressed himself, took a valise, came downstairs softly and laid it on a
      counter in the shop, together with his rapier and cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you doing?&rdquo; asked his father, hearing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe came up to the old man and kissed him on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any one to see my preparations for departure, and I have put
      them on a counter in the shop,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the letter,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe took the paper and went out as if to fetch his young neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after his departure the goodman Lallier and his daughter
      arrived, preceded by a servant-woman, bearing three bottles of old wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where is Christophe?&rdquo; said old Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christophe!&rdquo; exclaimed Babette. &ldquo;We have not seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! my son is a bold scamp! He tricks me as if I had no beard. My
      dear crony, what think you he will turn out to be? We live in days when
      the children have more sense than their fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the quarter has long been saying he is in some mischief,&rdquo; said
      Lallier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse him on that point, crony,&rdquo; said the furrier. &ldquo;Youth is foolish; it
      runs after new things; but Babette will keep him quiet; she is newer than
      Calvin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babette smiled; she loved Christophe, and was angry when anything was said
      against him. She was one of those daughters of the old bourgeoisie brought
      up under the eyes of a mother who never left her. Her bearing was gentle
      and correct as her face; she always wore woollen stuffs of gray,
      harmonious in tone; her chemisette, simply pleated, contrasted its
      whiteness against the gown. Her cap of brown velvet was like an infant&rsquo;s
      coif, but it was trimmed with a ruche and lappets of tanned gauze, that
      is, of a tan color, which came down on each side of her face. Though fair
      and white as a true blonde, she seemed to be shrewd and roguish, all the
      while trying to hide her roguishness under the air and manner of a
      well-trained girl. While the two servant-women went and came, laying the
      cloth and placing the jugs, the great pewter dishes, and the knives and
      forks, the jeweller and his daughter, the furrier and his wife, sat before
      the tall chimney-piece draped with lambrequins of red serge and black
      fringes, and were talking of trifles. Babette asked once or twice where
      Christophe could be, and the father and mother of the young Huguenot gave
      evasive answers; but when the two families were seated at table, and the
      two servants had retired to the kitchen, Lecamus said to his future
      daughter-in-law:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christophe has gone to court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Blois! Such a journey as that without bidding me good-bye!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter was pressing,&rdquo; said the old mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crony,&rdquo; said the furrier, resuming a suspended conversation. &ldquo;We are
      going to have troublous times in France. The Reformers are bestirring
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they triumph, it will only be after a long war, during which business
      will be at a standstill,&rdquo; said Lallier, incapable of rising higher than
      the commercial sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, who saw the wars between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs
      told me that our family would never have come out safely if one of his
      grandfathers&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s father&mdash;had not been a Goix, one of
      those famous butchers in the Market who stood by the Burgundians; whereas
      the other, the Lecamus, was for the Armagnacs; they seemed ready to flay
      each other alive before the world, but they were excellent friends in the
      family. So, let us both try to save Christophe; perhaps the time may come
      when he will save us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a shrewd one,&rdquo; said the jeweller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lecamus. &ldquo;The burghers ought to think of themselves; the
      populace and the nobility are both against them. The Parisian bourgeoisie
      alarms everybody except the king, who knows it is his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You who are so wise and have seen so many things,&rdquo; said Babette, timidly,
      &ldquo;explain to me what the Reformers really want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tell us that, crony,&rdquo; cried the jeweller. &ldquo;I knew the late king&rsquo;s
      tailor, and I held him to be a man of simple life, without great talent;
      he was something like you; a man to whom they&rsquo;d give the sacrament without
      confession; and behold! he plunged to the depths of this new religion,&mdash;he!
      a man whose two ears were worth all of a hundred thousand crowns apiece.
      He must have had secrets to reveal to induce the king and the Duchesse de
      Valentinois to be present at his torture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And terrible secrets, too!&rdquo; said the furrier. &ldquo;The Reformation, my
      friends,&rdquo; he continued in a low voice, &ldquo;will give back to the bourgeoisie
      the estates of the Church. When the ecclesiastical privileges are
      suppressed the Reformers intend to ask that the <i>vilain</i> shall be
      imposed on nobles as well as on burghers, and they mean to insist that the
      king alone shall be above others&mdash;if indeed, they allow the State to
      have a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppress the Throne!&rdquo; ejaculated Lallier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! crony,&rdquo; said Lecamus, &ldquo;in the Low Countries the burghers govern
      themselves with burgomasters of their own, who elect their own temporary
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me, crony; we ought to do these fine things and yet stay
      Catholics,&rdquo; cried the jeweller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too old, you and I, to see the triumph of the Parisian
      bourgeoisie, but it will triumph, I tell you, in times to come as it did
      of yore. Ha! the king must rest upon it in order to resist, and we have
      always sold him our help dear. The last time, all the burghers were
      ennobled, and he gave them permission to buy seignorial estates and take
      titles from the land without special letters from the king. You and I,
      grandsons of the Goix through our mothers, are not we as good as any
      lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were so alarming to the jeweller and the two women that they
      were followed by a dead silence. The ferments of 1789 were already
      tingling in the veins of Lecamus, who was not yet so old but what he could
      live to see the bold burghers of the Ligue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you selling well in spite of these troubles?&rdquo; said Lallier to
      Mademoiselle Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troubles always do harm,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason why I am so set on making my son a lawyer,&rdquo; said
      Lecamus; &ldquo;for squabbles and law go on forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation then turned to commonplace topics, to the great
      satisfaction of the jeweller, who was not fond of either political
      troubles or audacity of thought.

    <h2>
      III. THE CHATEAU DE BLOIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The banks of the Loire, from Blois to Angers, were the favorite resort of
      the last two branches of the royal race which occupied the throne before
      the house of Bourbon. That beautiful valley plain so well deserves the
      honor bestowed upon it by kings that we must here repeat what was said of
      it by one of our most eloquent writers:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There is one province in France which is never sufficiently
  admired. Fragrant as Italy, flowery as the banks of the
  Guadalquivir, beautiful especially in its own characteristics,
  wholly French, having always been French,&mdash;unlike in that respect
  to our northern provinces, which have degenerated by contact with
  Germany, and to our southern provinces, which have lived in
  concubinage with Moors, Spaniards, and all other nationalities
  that adjoined them. This pure, chaste, brave, and loyal province
  is Touraine. Historic France is there! Auvergne is Auvergne,
  Languedoc is only Languedoc; but Touraine is France; the most
  national river for Frenchmen is the Loire, which waters Touraine.
  For this reason we ought not to be surprised at the great number
  of historically noble buildings possessed by those departments
  which have taken the name, or derivations of the name, of the
  Loire. At every step we take in this land of enchantment we
  discover a new picture, bordered, it may be, by a river, or a
  tranquil lake reflecting in its liquid depths a castle with
  towers, and woods and sparkling waterfalls. It is quite natural
  that in a region chosen by Royalty for its sojourn, where the
  court was long established, great families and fortunes and
  distinguished men should have settled and built palaces as grand
  as themselves.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But is it not incomprehensible that Royalty did not follow the advice
      indirectly given by Louis XI. to place the capital of the kingdom at
      Tours? There, without great expense, the Loire might have been made
      accessible for the merchant service, and also for vessels-of-war of light
      draught. There, too, the seat of government would have been safe from the
      dangers of invasion. Had this been done, the northern cities would not
      have required such vast sums of money spent to fortify them,&mdash;sums as
      vast as were those expended on the sumptuous glories of Versailles. If
      Louis XIV. had listened to Vauban, who wished to build his great palace at
      Mont Louis, between the Loire and the Cher, perhaps the revolution of 1789
      might never have taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      These beautiful shores still bear the marks of royal tenderness. The
      chateaus of Chambord, Amboise, Blois, Chenonceaux, Chaumont,
      Plessis-les-Tours, all those which the mistresses of kings, financiers,
      and nobles built at Veretz, Azay-le-Rideau, Usse, Villandri, Valencay,
      Chanteloup, Duretal, some of which have disappeared, though most of them
      still remain, are admirable relics which remind us of the marvels of a
      period that is little understood by the literary sect of the
      Middle-agists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all these chateaus, that of Blois, where the court was then staying,
      is one on which the magnificence of the houses of Orleans and of Valois
      has placed its brilliant sign-manual,&mdash;making it the most interesting
      of all for historians, archaeologists, and Catholics. It was at the time
      of which we write completely isolated. The town, enclosed by massive walls
      supported by towers, lay below the fortress,&mdash;for the chateau served,
      in fact, as fort and pleasure-house. Above the town, with its blue-tiled,
      crowded roofs extending then, as now, from the river to the crest of the
      hill which commands the right bank, lies a triangular plateau, bounded to
      the west by a streamlet, which in these days is of no importance, for it
      flows beneath the town; but in the fifteenth century, so say historians,
      it formed quite a deep ravine, of which there still remains a sunken road,
      almost an abyss, between the suburbs of the town and the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this plateau, with a double exposure to the north and south,
      that the counts of Blois built, in the architecture of the twelfth
      century, a castle where the famous Thibault de Tircheur, Thibault le
      Vieux, and others held a celebrated court. In those days of pure
      fuedality, in which the king was merely <i>primus inter pares</i> (to use
      the fine expression of a king of Poland), the counts of Champagne, the
      counts of Blois, those of Anjou, the simple barons of Normandie, the dukes
      of Bretagne, lived with the splendor of sovereign princes and gave kings
      to the proudest kingdoms. The Plantagenets of Anjou, the Lusignans of
      Poitou, the Roberts of Normandie, maintained with a bold hand the royal
      races, and sometimes simple knights like du Glaicquin refused the purple,
      preferring the sword of a connetable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Crown annexed the county of Blois to its domain, Louis XII., who
      had a liking for this residence (perhaps to escape Plessis of sinister
      memory), built at the back of the first building another building, facing
      east and west, which connected the chateau of the counts of Blois with the
      rest of the old structures, of which nothing now remains but the vast hall
      in which the States-general were held under Henri III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he became enamoured of Chambord, Francois I. wished to complete the
      chateau of Blois by adding two other wings, which would have made the
      structure a perfect square. But Chambord weaned him from Blois, where he
      built only one wing, which in his time and that of his grandchildren was
      the only inhabited part of the chateau. This third building erected by
      Francois I. is more vast and far more decorated than the Louvre, the
      chateau of Henri II. It is in the style of architecture now called
      Renaissance, and presents the most fantastic features of that style.
      Therefore, at a period when a strict and jealous architecture ruled
      construction, when the Middle Ages were not even considered, at a time
      when literature was not as clearly welded to art as it is now, La Fontaine
      said of the chateau de Blois, in his hearty, good-humored way: &ldquo;The part
      that Francois I. built, if looked at from the outside, pleased me better
      than all the rest; there I saw numbers of little galleries, little
      windows, little balconies, little ornamentations without order or
      regularity, and they make up a grand whole which I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chateau of Blois had, therefore, the merit of representing three
      orders of architecture, three epochs, three systems, three dominions.
      Perhaps there is no other royal residence that can compare with it in that
      respect. This immense structure presents to the eye in one enclosure,
      round one courtyard, a complete and perfect image of that grand
      presentation of the manners and customs and life of nations which is
      called Architecture. At the moment when Christophe was to visit the court,
      that part of the adjacent land which in our day is covered by a fourth
      palace, built seventy years later (by Gaston, the rebellious brother of
      Louis XIII., then exiled to Blois), was an open space containing
      pleasure-grounds and hanging gardens, picturesquely placed among the
      battlements and unfinished turrets of Francois I.&lsquo;s chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      These gardens communicated, by a bridge of a fine, bold construction
      (which the old men of Blois may still remember to have seen demolished)
      with a pleasure-ground on the other side of the chateau, which, by the lay
      of the land, was on the same level. The nobles attached to the Court of
      Anne de Bretagne, or those of that province who came to solicit favors, or
      to confer with the queen as to the fate and condition of Brittany, awaited
      in this pleasure-ground the opportunity for an audience, either at the
      queen&rsquo;s rising, or at her coming out to walk. Consequently, history has
      given the name of &ldquo;Perchoir aux Bretons&rdquo; to this piece of ground, which,
      in our day, is the fruit-garden of a worthy bourgeois, and forms a
      projection into the place des Jesuites. The latter place was included in
      the gardens of this beautiful royal residence, which had, as we have said,
      its upper and its lower gardens. Not far from the place des Jesuites may
      still be seen a pavilion built by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, where, according
      to the historians of Blois, warm mineral baths were placed for her to use.
      This detail enables us to trace the very irregular disposition of the
      gardens, which went up or down according to the undulations of the ground,
      becoming extremely intricate around the chateau,&mdash;a fact which helped
      to give it strength, and caused, as we shall see, the discomfiture of the
      Duc de Guise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardens were reached from the chateau through external and internal
      galleries, the most important of which was called the &ldquo;Galerie des Cerfs&rdquo;
       on account of its decoration. This gallery led to the magnificent
      staircase which, no doubt, inspired the famous double staircase of
      Chambord. It led, from floor to floor, to all the apartments of the
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though La Fontaine preferred the chateau of Francois I. to that of Louis
      XII., perhaps the naivete of that of the good king will give true artists
      more pleasure, while at the same time they admire the magnificent
      structure of the knightly king. The elegance of the two staircases which
      are placed at each end of the chateau of Louis XII., the delicate carving
      and sculpture, so original in design, which abound everywhere, the remains
      of which, though time has done its worst, still charm the antiquary, all,
      even to the semi-cloistral distribution of the apartments, reveals a great
      simplicity of manners. Evidently, the <i>court</i> did not yet exist; it
      had not developed, as it did under Francois I. and Catherine de&rsquo; Medici,
      to the great detriment of feudal customs. As we admire the galleries, or
      most of them, the capitals of the columns, and certain figurines of
      exquisite delicacy, it is impossible not to imagine that Michel Columb,
      that great sculptor, the Michel-Angelo of Brittany, passed that way for
      the pleasure of Queen Anne, whom he afterwards immortalized on the tomb of
      her father, the last duke of Brittany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever La Fontaine may choose to say about the &ldquo;little galleries&rdquo; and
      the &ldquo;little ornamentations,&rdquo; nothing can be more grandiose than the
      dwelling of the splendid Francois. Thanks to I know not what indifference,
      to forgetfulness perhaps, the apartments occupied by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici
      and her son Francois II. present to us to-day the leading features of that
      time. The historian can there restore the tragic scenes of the drama of
      the Reformation,&mdash;a drama in which the dual struggle of the Guises
      and of the Bourbons against the Valois was a series of most complicated
      acts, the plot of which was here unravelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chateau of Francois I. completely crushes the artless habitation of
      Louis XII. by its imposing masses. On the side of the gardens, that is,
      toward the modern place des Jesuites, the castle presents an elevation
      nearly double that which it shows on the side of the courtyard. The
      ground-floor on this side forms the second floor on the side of the
      gardens, where are placed the celebrated galleries. Thus the first floor
      above the ground-floor toward the courtyard (where Queen Catherine was
      lodged) is the third floor on the garden side, and the king&rsquo;s apartments
      were four storeys above the garden, which at the time of which we write
      was separated from the base of the castle by a deep moat. The chateau,
      already colossal as viewed from the courtyard, appears gigantic when seen
      from below, as La Fontaine saw it. He mentions particularly that he did
      not enter either the courtyard or the apartments, and it is to be remarked
      that from the place des Jesuites all the details seem small. The balconies
      on which the courtiers promenaded; the galleries, marvellously executed;
      the sculptured windows, whose embrasures are so deep as to form boudoirs&mdash;for
      which indeed they served&mdash;resemble at that great height the fantastic
      decorations which scene-painters give to a fairy palace at the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the courtyard, although the three storeys above the ground-floor
      rise as high as the clock-tower of the Tuileries, the infinite delicacy of
      the architecture reveals itself to the rapture of our astonished eyes.
      This wing of the great building, in which the two queens, Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici and Mary Stuart, held their sumptuous court, is divided in the
      centre by a hexagon tower, in the empty well of which winds up a spiral
      staircase,&mdash;a Moorish caprice, designed by giants, made by dwarfs,
      which gives to this wonderful facade the effect of a dream. The baluster
      of this staircase forms a spiral connecting itself by a square landing to
      five of the six sides of the tower, requiring at each landing transversal
      corbels which are decorated with arabesque carvings without and within.
      This bewildering creation of ingenious and delicate details, of marvels
      which give speech to stones, can be compared only to the deeply worked and
      crowded carving of the Chinese ivories. Stone is made to look like
      lace-work. The flowers, the figures of men and animals clinging to the
      structure of the stairway, are multiplied, step by step, until they crown
      the tower with a key-stone on which the chisels of the art of the
      sixteenth century have contended against the naive cutters of images who
      fifty years earlier had carved the key-stones of Louis XII.&lsquo;s two
      stairways.
    </p>
    <p>
      However dazzled we may be by these recurring forms of indefatigable labor,
      we cannot fail to see that money was lacking to Francois I. for Blois, as
      it was to Louis XIV. for Versailles. More than one figurine lifts its
      delicate head from a block of rough stone behind it; more than one
      fantastic flower is merely indicated by chiselled touches on the abandoned
      stone, though dampness has since laid its blossoms of mouldy greenery upon
      it. On the facade, side by side with the tracery of one window, another
      window presents its masses of jagged stone carved only by the hand of
      time. Here, to the least artistic and the least trained eye, is a
      ravishing contrast between this frontage, where marvels throng, and the
      interior frontage of the chateau of Louis XII., which is composed of a
      ground-floor of arcades of fairy lightness supported by tiny columns
      resting at their base on a graceful platform, and of two storeys above it,
      the windows of which are carved with delightful sobriety. Beneath the
      arcade is a gallery, the walls of which are painted in fresco, the ceiling
      also being painted; traces can still be found of this magnificence,
      derived from Italy, and testifying to the expeditions of our kings, to
      which the principality of Milan then belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite to Francois I.&lsquo;s wing was the chapel of the counts of Blois, the
      facade of which is almost in harmony with the architecture of the later
      dwelling of Louis XII. No words can picture the majestic solidity of these
      three distinct masses of building. In spite of their nonconformity of
      style, Royalty, powerful and firm, demonstrating its dangers by the
      greatness of its precautions, was a bond, uniting these three edifices, so
      different in character, two of which rested against the vast hall of the
      States-general, towering high like a church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, neither the simplicity nor the strength of the burgher
      existence (which were depicted at the beginning of this history) in which
      Art was always represented, were lacking to this royal habitation. Blois
      was the fruitful and brilliant example to which the Bourgeoisie and
      Feudality, Wealth and Nobility, gave such splendid replies in the towns
      and in the rural regions. Imagination could not desire any other sort of
      dwelling for the prince who reigned over France in the sixteenth century.
      The richness of seignorial garments, the luxury of female adornment, must
      have harmonized delightfully with the lace-work of these stones so
      wonderfully manipulated. From floor to floor, as the king of France went
      up the marvellous staircase of his chateau of Blois, he could see the
      broad expanse of the beautiful Loire, which brought him news of all his
      kingdom as it lay on either side of the great river, two halves of a State
      facing each other, and semi-rivals. If, instead of building Chambord in a
      barren, gloomy plain two leagues away, Francois I. had placed it where,
      seventy years later, Gaston built his palace, Versailles would never have
      existed, and Blois would have become, necessarily, the capital of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four Valois and Catherine de&rsquo; Medici lavished their wealth on the wing
      built by Francois I. at Blois. Who can look at those massive
      partition-walls, the spinal column of the castle, in which are sunken deep
      alcoves, secret staircases, cabinets, while they themselves enclose halls
      as vast as that great council-room, the guardroom, and the royal chambers,
      in which, in our day, a regiment of infantry is comfortably lodged&mdash;who
      can look at all this and not be aware of the prodigalities of Crown and
      court? Even if a visitor does not at once understand how the splendor
      within must have corresponded with the splendor without, the remaining
      vestiges of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s cabinet, where Christophe was about to
      be introduced, would bear sufficient testimony to the elegances of Art
      which peopled these apartments with animated designs in which salamanders
      sparkled among the wreaths, and the palette of the sixteenth century
      illumined the darkest corners with its brilliant coloring. In this cabinet
      an observer will still find traces of that taste for gilding which
      Catherine brought with her from Italy; for the princesses of her house
      loved, in the words of the author already quoted, to veneer the castles of
      France with the gold earned by their ancestors in commerce, and to hang
      out their wealth on the walls of their apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother occupied on the first upper floor of the apartments of
      Queen Claude of France, wife of Francois I., in which may still be seen,
      delicately carved, the double C accompanied by figures, purely white, of
      swans and lilies, signifying <i>candidior candidis</i>&mdash;more white
      than the whitest&mdash;the motto of the queen whose name began, like that
      of Catherine, with a C, and which applied as well to the daughter of Louis
      XII. as to the mother of the last Valois; for no suspicion, in spite of
      the violence of Calvinist calumny, has tarnished the fidelity of Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici to Henri II.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother, still charged with the care of two young children (him
      who was afterward Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, and Marguerite, the wife of Henri IV.,
      the sister whom Charles IX. called Margot), had need of the whole of the
      first upper floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, Francois II., and the queen, Mary Stuart, occupied, on the
      second floor, the royal apartments which had formerly been those of
      Francois I. and were, subsequently, those of Henri III. This floor, like
      that taken by the queen-mother, is divided in two parts throughout its
      whole length by the famous partition-wall, which is more than four feet
      thick, against which rests the enormous walls which separate the rooms
      from each other. Thus, on both floors, the apartments are in two distinct
      halves. One half, to the south, looking to the courtyard, served for
      public receptions and for the transaction of business; whereas the private
      apartments were placed, partly to escape the heat, to the north,
      overlooking the gardens, on which side is the splendid facade with its
      balconies and galleries looking out upon the open country of the
      Vendomois, and down upon the &ldquo;Perchoir des Bretons&rdquo; and the moat, the only
      side of which La Fontaine speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chateau of Francois I. was, in those days, terminated by an enormous
      unfinished tower which was intended to mark the colossal angle of the
      building when the succeeding wing was built. Later, Gaston took down one
      side of it, in order to build his palace on to it; but he never finished
      the work, and the tower remained in ruins. This royal stronghold served as
      a prison or dungeon, according to popular tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we wander to-day through the halls of this matchless chateau, so
      precious to art and to history, what poet would not be haunted by regrets,
      and grieved for France, at seeing the arabesques of Catherine&rsquo;s boudoir <i>whitewashed</i>
      and almost obliterated, by order of the quartermaster of the barracks
      (this royal residence is now a barrack) at the time of an outbreak of
      cholera. The panels of Catherine&rsquo;s boudoir, a room of which we are about
      to speak, is the last remaining relic of the rich decorations accumulated
      by five artistic kings. Making our way through the labyrinth of chambers,
      halls, stairways, towers, we may say to ourselves with solemn certitude:
      &ldquo;Here Mary Stuart cajoled her husband on behalf of the Guises.&rdquo; &ldquo;There,
      the Guises insulted Catherine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Later, at that very spot the second
      Balafre fell beneath the daggers of the avengers of the Crown.&rdquo; &ldquo;A century
      earlier, from this very window, Louis XII. made signs to his friend
      Cardinal d&rsquo;Amboise to come to him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, on this balcony, d&rsquo;Epernon, the
      accomplice of Ravaillac, met Marie de&rsquo; Medici, who knew, it was said, of
      the proposed regicide, and allowed it to be committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the chapel, where the marriage of Henri IV. and Marguerite de Valois
      took place, the sole remaining fragment of the chateau of the counts of
      Blois, a regiment now makes it shoes. This wonderful structure, in which
      so many styles may still be seen, so many great deeds have been performed,
      is in a state of dilapidation which disgraces France. What grief for those
      who love the great historic monuments of our country to know that soon
      those eloquent stones will be lost to sight and knowledge, like others at
      the corner of the rue de la Vieille-Pelleterie; possibly, they will exist
      nowhere but in these pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to remark that, in order to watch the royal court more
      closely, the Guises, although they had a house of their own in the town,
      which still exists, had obtained permission to occupy the upper floor
      above the apartments of Louis XII., the same lodgings afterwards occupied
      by the Duchesse de Nemours under the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young king, Francois II., and his bride Mary Stuart, in love with each
      other like the girl and boy of sixteen which they were, had been abruptly
      transferred, in the depth of winter, from the chateau de Saint-Germain,
      which the Duc de Guise thought liable to attack, to the fortress which the
      chateau of Blois then was, being isolated and protected on three sides by
      precipices, and admirably defended as to its entrance. The Guises, uncles
      of Mary Stuart, had powerful reasons for not residing in Paris and for
      keeping the king and court in a castle the whole exterior surroundings of
      which could easily be watched and defended. A struggle was now beginning
      around the throne, between the house of Lorraine and the house of Valois,
      which was destined to end in this very chateau, twenty-eight years later,
      namely in 1588, when Henri III., under the very eyes of his mother, at
      that moment deeply humiliated by the Lorrains, heard fall upon the floor
      of his own cabinet, the head of the boldest of all the Guises, the second
      Balafre, son of that first Balafre by whom Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was now
      being tricked, watched, threatened, and virtually imprisoned.

    <h2>
      IV. THE QUEEN-MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      This noble chateau of Blois was to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici the narrowest of
      prisons. On the death of her husband, who had always held her in
      subjection, she expected to reign; but, on the contrary, she found herself
      crushed under the thraldom of strangers, whose polished manners were
      really far more brutal than those of jailers. No action of hers could be
      done secretly. The women who attended her either had lovers among the
      Guises or were watched by Argus eyes. These were times when passions
      notably exhibited the strange effects produced in all ages by the strong
      antagonism of two powerful conflicting interests in the State. Gallantry,
      which served Catherine so well, was also an auxiliary of the Guises. The
      Prince de Conde, the first leader of the Reformation, was a lover of the
      Marechale de Saint-Andre, whose husband was the tool of the Grand Master.
      The cardinal, convinced by the affair of the Vidame de Chartres, that
      Catherine was more unconquered than invulnerable as to love, was paying
      court to her. The play of all these passions strangely complicated those
      of politics,&mdash;making, as it were, a double game of chess, in which
      both parties had to watch the head and heart of their opponent, in order
      to know, when a crisis came, whether the one would betray the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she was constantly in presence of the Cardinal de Lorraine or of
      Duc Francois de Guise, who both distrusted her, the closest and ablest
      enemy of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was her daughter-in-law, Queen Mary, a fair
      little creature, malicious as a waiting-maid, proud as a Stuart wearing
      three crowns, learned as an old pedant, giddy as a school-girl, as much in
      love with her husband as a courtesan is with her lover, devoted to her
      uncles whom she admired, and delighted to see the king share (at her
      instigation) the regard she had for them. A mother-in-law is always a
      person whom the daughter-in-law is inclined not to like; especially when
      she wears the crown and wishes to retain it, which Catherine had
      imprudently made but too well known. Her former position, when Diane de
      Poitiers had ruled Henri II., was more tolerable than this; then at least
      she received the external honors that were due to a queen, and the homage
      of the court. But now the duke and the cardinal, who had none but their
      own minions about them, seemed to take pleasure in abasing her. Catherine,
      hemmed in on all sides by their courtiers, received, not only day by day
      but from hour to hour, terrible blows to her pride and her self-love; for
      the Guises were determined to treat her on the same system of repression
      which the late king, her husband, had so long pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thirty-six years of anguish which were now about to desolate France
      may, perhaps, be said to have begun by the scene in which the son of the
      furrier of the two queens was sent on the perilous errand which makes him
      the chief figure of our present Study. The danger into which this zealous
      Reformer was about to fall became imminent the very morning on which he
      started from the port of Beaugency for the chateau de Blois, bearing
      precious documents which compromised the highest heads of the nobility,
      placed in his hands by that wily partisan, the indefatigable La Renaudie,
      who met him, as agreed upon, at Beaugency, having reached that port before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the tow-boat, in which Christophe now embarked floated, impelled by
      a light east wind, down the river Loire the famous Cardinal de Lorraine,
      and his brother the second Duc de Guise, one of the greatest warriors of
      those days, were contemplating, like eagles perched on a rocky summit,
      their present situation, and looking prudently about them before striking
      the great blow by which they intended to kill the Reform in France at
      Amboise,&mdash;an attempt renewed twelve years later in Paris, August 24,
      1572, on the feast of Saint-Bartholomew.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night three <i>seigneurs</i>, who each played a great part in
      the twelve years&rsquo; drama which followed this double plot now laid by the
      Guises and also by the Reformers, had arrived at Blois from different
      directions, each riding at full speed, and leaving their horses half-dead
      at the postern-gate of the chateau, which was guarded by captains and
      soldiers absolutely devoted to the Duc de Guise, the idol of all warriors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word about that great man,&mdash;a word that must tell, in the first
      instance, whence his fortunes took their rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was Antoinette de Bourbon, great-aunt of Henri IV. Of what
      avail is consanguinity? He was, at this moment, aiming at the head of his
      cousin the Prince de Conde. His niece was Mary Stuart. His wife was Anne,
      daughter of the Duke of Ferrara. The Grand Connetable de Montmorency
      called the Duc de Guise &ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo; as he would the king,&mdash;ending
      his letter with &ldquo;Your very humble servant.&rdquo; Guise, Grand Master of the
      king&rsquo;s household, replied &ldquo;Monsieur le connetable,&rdquo; and signed, as he did
      for the Parliament, &ldquo;Your very good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the cardinal, called the transalpine pope, and his Holiness, by
      Estienne, he had the whole monastic Church of France on his side, and
      treated the Holy Father as an equal. Vain of his eloquence, and one of the
      greatest theologians of his time, he kept incessant watch over France and
      Italy by means of three religious orders who were absolutely devoted to
      him, toiling day and night in his service and serving him as spies and
      counsellors.
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words will explain to what heights of power the duke and the
      cardinal had attained. In spite of their wealth and the enormous revenues
      of their several offices, they were so personally disinterested, so
      eagerly carried away on the current of their statesmanship, and so
      generous at heart, that they were always in debt, doubtless after the
      manner of Caesar. When Henri III. caused the death of the second Balafre,
      whose life was a menace to him, the house of Guise was necessarily ruined.
      The costs of endeavoring to seize the crown during a whole century will
      explain the lowered position of this great house during the reigns of
      Louis XIII. and Louis XIV., when the sudden death of MADAME told all
      Europe the infamous part which a Chevalier de Lorraine had debased himself
      to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling themselves the heirs of the dispossessed Carolovingians, the duke
      and cardinal acted with the utmost insolence towards Catherine de&rsquo; Medici,
      the mother-in-law of their niece. The Duchesse de Guise spared her no
      mortification. This duchesse was a d&rsquo;Este, and Catherine was a Medici, the
      daughter of upstart Florentine merchants, whom the sovereigns of Europe
      had never yet admitted into their royal fraternity. Francois I. himself
      has always considered his son&rsquo;s marriage with a Medici as a mesalliance,
      and only consented to it under the expectation that his second son would
      never be dauphin. Hence his fury when his eldest son was poisoned by the
      Florentine Montecuculi. The d&rsquo;Estes refused to recognize the Medici as
      Italian princes. Those former merchants were in fact trying to solve the
      impossible problem of maintaining a throne in the midst of republican
      institutions. The title of grand-duke was only granted very tardily by
      Philip the Second, king of Spain, to reward those Medici who bought it by
      betraying France their benefactress, and servilely attaching themselves to
      the court of Spain, which was at the very time covertly counteracting them
      in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatter none but your enemies,&rdquo; the famous saying of Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici, seems to have been the political rule of life with that family of
      merchant princes, in which great men were never lacking until their
      destinies became great, when they fell, before their time, into that
      degeneracy in which royal races and noble families are wont to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three generations there had been a great Lorrain warrior and a great
      Lorrain churchman; and, what is more singular, the churchmen all bore a
      strong resemblance in the face to Ximenes, as did Cardinal Richelieu in
      after days. These five great cardinals all had sly, mean, and yet terrible
      faces; while the warriors, on the other hand, were of that type of Basque
      mountaineer which we see in Henri IV. The two Balafres, father and son,
      wounded and scarred in the same manner, lost something of this type, but
      not the grace and affability by which, as much as by their bravery, they
      won the hearts of the soldiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not useless to relate how the present Grand Master received his
      wound; for it was healed by the heroic measures of a personage of our
      drama,&mdash;by Ambroise Pare, the man we have already mentioned as under
      obligations to Lecamus, syndic of the guild of furriers. At the siege of
      Calais the duke had his face pierced through and through by a lance, the
      point of which, after entering the cheek just below the right eye, went
      through to the neck, below the left eye, and remained, broken off, in the
      face. The duke lay dying in his tent in the midst of universal distress,
      and he would have died had it not been for the devotion and prompt courage
      of Ambroise Pare. &ldquo;The duke is not dead, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said to the
      weeping attendants, &ldquo;but he soon will die if I dare not treat him as I
      would a dead man; and I shall risk doing so, no matter what it may cost me
      in the end. See!&rdquo; And with that he put his left foot on the duke&rsquo;s breast,
      took the broken wooden end of the lance in his fingers, shook and loosened
      it by degrees in the wound, and finally succeeded in drawing out the iron
      head, as if he were handling a thing and not a man. Though he saved the
      prince by this heroic treatment, he could not prevent the horrible scar
      which gave the great soldier his nickname,&mdash;Le Balafre, the Scarred.
      This name descended to the son, and for a similar reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely masters of Francois II., whom his wife ruled through their
      mutual and excessive passion, these two great Lorrain princes, the duke
      and the cardinal, were masters of France, and had no other enemy at court
      than Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. No great statesmen ever played a closer or more
      watchful game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mutual position of the ambitious widow of Henri II. and the ambitious
      house of Lorraine was pictured, as it were, to the eye by a scene which
      took place on the terrace of the chateau de Blois very early in the
      morning of the day on which Christophe Lecamus was destined to arrive
      there. The queen-mother, who feigned an extreme attachment to the Guises,
      had asked to be informed of the news brought by the three <i>seigneurs</i>
      coming from three different parts of the kingdom; but she had the
      mortification of being courteously dismissed by the cardinal. She then
      walked to the parterres which overhung the Loire, where she was building,
      under the superintendence of her astrologer, Ruggieri, an observatory,
      which is still standing, and from which the eye may range over the whole
      landscape of that delightful valley. The two Lorrain princes were at the
      other end of the terrace, facing the Vendomois, which overlooks the upper
      part of the town, the perch of the Bretons, and the postern gate of the
      chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine had deceived the two brothers by pretending to a slight
      displeasure; for she was in reality very well pleased to have an
      opportunity to speak to one of the three young men who had arrived in such
      haste. This was a young nobleman named Chiverni, apparently a tool of the
      cardinal, in reality a devoted servant of Catherine. Catherine also
      counted among her devoted servants two Florentine nobles, the Gondi; but
      they were so suspected by the Guises that she dared not send them on any
      errand away from the court, where she kept them, watched, it is true, in
      all their words and actions, but where at least they were able to watch
      and study the Guises and counsel Catherine. These two Florentines
      maintained in the interests of the queen-mother another Italian, Birago,&mdash;a
      clever Piedmontese, who pretended, with Chiverni, to have abandoned their
      mistress, and gone over to the Guises, who encouraged their enterprises
      and employed them to watch Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiverni had come from Paris and Ecouen. The last to arrive was
      Saint-Andre, who was marshal of France and became so important that the
      Guises, whose creature he was, made him the third person in the
      triumvirate they formed the following year against Catherine. The other <i>seigneur</i>
      who had arrived during the night was Vieilleville, also a creature of the
      Guises and a marshal of France, who was returning from a secret mission
      known only to the Grand Master, who had entrusted it to him. As for
      Saint-Andre, he was in charge of military measures taken with the object
      of driving all Reformers under arms into Amboise; a scheme which now
      formed the subject of a council held by the duke and cardinal, Birago,
      Chiverni, Vieilleville, and Saint-Andre. As the two Lorrains employed
      Birago, it is to be supposed that they relied upon their own powers; for
      they knew of his attachment to the queen-mother. At this singular epoch
      the double part played by many of the political men of the day was well
      known to both parties; they were like cards in the hands of gamblers,&mdash;the
      cleverest player won the game. During this council the two brothers
      maintained the most impenetrable reserve. A conversation which now took
      place between Catherine and certain of her friends will explain the object
      of this council, held by the Guises in the open air, in the hanging
      gardens, at break of day, as if they feared to speak within the walls of
      the chateau de Blois.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother, under pretence of examining the observatory then in
      process of construction, walked in that direction accompanied by the two
      Gondis, glancing with a suspicious and inquisitive eye at the group of
      enemies who were still standing at the farther end of the terrace, and
      from whom Chiverni now detached himself to join the queen-mother. She was
      then at the corner of the terrace which looks down upon the Church of
      Saint-Nicholas; there, at least, there could be no danger of the slightest
      overhearing. The wall of the terrace is on a level with the towers of the
      church, and the Guises invariably held their council at the farther corner
      of the same terrace at the base of the great unfinished keep or dungeon,&mdash;going
      and returning between the Perchoir des Bretons and the gallery by the
      bridge which joined them to the gardens. No one was within sight. Chiverni
      raised the hand of the queen-mother to kiss it, and as he did so he
      slipped a little note from his hand to hers, without being observed by the
      two Italians. Catherine turned to the angle of the parapet and read as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  You are powerful enough to hold the balance between the leaders
  and to force them into a struggle as to who shall serve you; your
  house is full of kings, and you have nothing to fear from the
  Lorrains or the Bourbons provided you pit them one against the
  other, for both are striving to snatch the crown from your
  children. Be the mistress and not the servant of your counsellors;
  support them, in turn, one against the other, or the kingdom will
  go from bad to worse, and mighty wars may come of it.
</pre>
    <p>
      L&rsquo;Hopital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen put the letter in the hollow of her corset, resolving to burn it
      as soon as she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see him?&rdquo; she asked Chiverni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my way back from visiting the Connetable, at Melun, where I met him
      with the Duchesse de Berry, whom he was most impatient to convey to
      Savoie, that he might return here and open the eyes of the chancellor
      Olivier, who is now completely duped by the Lorrains. As soon as Monsieur
      l&rsquo;Hopital saw the true object of the Guises he determined to support your
      interests. That is why he is so anxious to get here and give you his vote
      at the councils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he sincere?&rdquo; asked Catherine. &ldquo;You know very well that if the Lorrains
      have put him in the council it is that he may help them to reign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L&rsquo;Hopital is a Frenchman who comes of too good a stock not to be honest
      and sincere,&rdquo; said Chiverni; &ldquo;Besides, his note is a sufficiently strong
      pledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What answer did the Connetable send to the Guises?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He replied that he was the servant of the king and would await his
      orders. On receiving that answer the cardinal, to suppress all resistance,
      determined to propose the appointment of his brother as lieutenant-general
      of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they got as far as that?&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, alarmed. &ldquo;Well, did
      Monsieur l&rsquo;Hopital send me no other message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to say to you, madame, that you alone could stand between the
      Crown and the Guises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he think that I ought to use the Huguenots as a weapon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; cried Chiverni, surprised at such astuteness, &ldquo;we never
      dreamed of casting you into such difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know the position I am in?&rdquo; asked the queen, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nearly. He thinks you were duped after the death of the king into
      accepting that castle on Madame Diane&rsquo;s overthrow. The Guises consider
      themselves released toward the queen by having satisfied the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the queen, looking at the two Gondi, &ldquo;I made a blunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blunder of the gods,&rdquo; replied Charles de Gondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;if I go over openly to the Reformers I shall
      become the slave of a party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Chiverni, eagerly, &ldquo;I approve entirely of your meaning. You
      must use them, but not serve them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though your support does, undoubtedly, for the time being lie there,&rdquo;
       said Charles de Gondi, &ldquo;we must not conceal from ourselves that success
      and defeat are both equally perilous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the queen; &ldquo;a single false step would be a pretext on
      which the Guises would seize at once to get rid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The niece of a Pope, the mother of four Valois, a queen of France, the
      widow of the most ardent persecutor of the Huguenots, an Italian Catholic,
      the aunt of Leo X.,&mdash;can <i>she</i> ally herself with the
      Reformation?&rdquo; asked Charles de Gondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said his brother Albert, &ldquo;if she seconds the Guises does she not
      play into the hands of a usurpation? We have to do with men who see a
      crown to seize in the coming struggle between Catholicism and Reform. It
      is possible to support the Reformers without abjuring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect, madame, that your family, which ought to have been wholly
      devoted to the king of France, is at this moment the servant of the king
      of Spain; and to-morrow it will be that of the Reformation if the
      Reformation could make a king of the Duke of Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly disposed to lend a hand, for a time, to the Huguenots,&rdquo;
       said Catherine, &ldquo;if only to revenge myself on that soldier and that priest
      and that woman!&rdquo; As she spoke, she called attention with her subtile
      Italian glance to the duke and cardinal, and then to the second floor of
      the chateau on which were the apartments of her son and Mary Stuart. &ldquo;That
      trio has taken from my hands the reins of State, for which I waited long
      while the old woman filled my place,&rdquo; she said gloomily, glancing toward
      Chenonceaux, the chateau she had lately exchanged with Diane de Poitiers
      against that of Chaumont. &ldquo;<i>Ma</i>,&rdquo; she added in Italian, &ldquo;it seems
      that these reforming gentry in Geneva have not the wit to address
      themselves to me; and, on my conscience, I cannot go to them. Not one of
      you would dare to risk carrying them a message!&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;I
      did hope you would have met the cripple at Ecouen&mdash;<i>he</i> has
      sense,&rdquo; she said to Chiverni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince de Conde was there, madame,&rdquo; said Chiverni, &ldquo;but he could not
      persuade the Connetable to join him. Monsieur de Montmorency wants to
      overthrow the Guises, who have sent him into exile, but he will not
      encourage heresy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will ever break these individual wills which are forever thwarting
      royalty? God&rsquo;s truth!&rdquo; exclaimed the queen, &ldquo;the great nobles must be made
      to destroy each other, as Louis XI., the greatest of your kings, did with
      those of his time. There are four or five parties now in this kingdom, and
      the weakest of them is that of my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reformation is an <i>idea</i>,&rdquo; said Charles de Gondi; &ldquo;the parties
      that Louis XI. crushed were moved by self-interests only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideas are behind selfish interests,&rdquo; replied Chiverni. &ldquo;Under Louis XI.
      the idea was the great Fiefs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make heresy an axe,&rdquo; said Albert de Gondi, &ldquo;and you will escape the odium
      of executions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;but I am ignorant of the strength and also of the
      plans of the Reformers; and I have no safe way of communicating with them.
      If I were detected in any manoeuvre of that kind, either by the queen, who
      watches me like an infant in a cradle, or by those two jailers over there,
      I should be banished from France and sent back to Florence with a terrible
      escort, commanded by Guise minions. Thank you, no, my daughter-in-law!&mdash;but
      I wish <i>you</i> the fate of being a prisoner in your own home, that you
      may know what you have made me suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their plans!&rdquo; exclaimed Chiverni; &ldquo;the duke and the cardinal know what
      they are, but those two foxes will not divulge them. If you could induce
      them to do so, madame, I would sacrifice myself for your sake and come to
      an understanding with the Prince de Conde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of the Guises&rsquo; own plans have they been forced to reveal to
      you?&rdquo; asked the queen, with a glance at the two brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Vieilleville and Monsieur de Saint-Andre have just received
      fresh orders, the nature of which is concealed from us; but I think the
      duke is intending to concentrate his best troops on the left bank. Within
      a few days you will all be moved to Amboise. The duke has been studying
      the position from this terrace and decides that Blois is not a propitious
      spot for his secret schemes. What can he want better?&rdquo; added Chiverni,
      pointing to the precipices which surrounded the chateau. &ldquo;There is no
      place in the world where the court is more secure from attack than it is
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abdicate or reign,&rdquo; said Albert in a low voice to the queen, who stood
      motionless and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible expression of inward rage passed over the fine ivory face of
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, who was not yet forty years old, though she had
      lived for twenty-six years at the court of France,&mdash;without power,
      she, who from the moment of her arrival intended to play a leading part!
      Then, in her native language, the language of Dante, these terrible words
      came slowly from her lips:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so long as that son lives!&mdash;His little wife bewitches him,&rdquo;
       she added after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine&rsquo;s exclamation was inspired by a prophecy which had been made to
      her a few days earlier at the chateau de Chaumont on the opposite bank of
      the river; where she had been taken by Ruggieri, her astrologer, to obtain
      information as to the lives of her four children from a celebrated female
      seer, secretly brought there by Nostradamus (chief among the physicians of
      that great sixteenth century) who practised, like the Ruggieri, the
      Cardans, Paracelsus, and others, the occult sciences. This woman, whose
      name and life have eluded history, foretold one year as the length of
      Francois&rsquo;s reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your opinion on all this,&rdquo; said Catherine to Chiverni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have a battle,&rdquo; replied the prudent courtier. &ldquo;The king of
      Navarre&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! say the queen,&rdquo; interrupted Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, the queen,&rdquo; said Chiverni, smiling, &ldquo;the queen has given the Prince
      de Conde as leader to the Reformers, and he, in his position of younger
      son, can venture all; consequently the cardinal talks of ordering him
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;I am saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the leaders of the great movement of the Reformation in France were
      justified in hoping for an ally in Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing to be considered,&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;The Bourbons may
      fool the Huguenots and the Sieurs Calvin and de Beze may fool the
      Bourbons, but are we strong enough to fool Huguenots, Bourbons, and
      Guises? In presence of three such enemies it is allowable to feel one&rsquo;s
      pulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they have not the king,&rdquo; said Albert de Gondi. &ldquo;You will always
      triumph, having the king on your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Maladetta Maria</i>!&rdquo; muttered Catherine between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lorrains are, even now, endeavoring to turn the burghers against
      you,&rdquo; remarked Birago.

    <h2>
      V. THE COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hope of gaining the crown was not the result of a premeditated plan in
      the minds of the restless Guises. Nothing warranted such a hope or such a
      plan. Circumstances alone inspired their audacity. The two cardinals and
      the two Balafres were four ambitious minds, superior in talents to all the
      other politicians who surrounded them. This family was never really
      brought low except by Henri IV.; a factionist himself, trained in the
      great school of which Catherine and the Guises were masters,&mdash;by
      whose lessons he had profited but too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the two brothers, the duke and cardinal, were the arbiters
      of the greatest revolution attempted in Europe since that of Henry VIII.
      in England, which was the direct consequence of the invention of printing.
      Adversaries to the Reformation, they meant to stifle it, power being in
      their hands. But their opponent, Calvin, though less famous than Luther,
      was far the stronger of the two. Calvin saw government where Luther saw
      dogma only. While the stout beer-drinker and amorous German fought with
      the devil and flung an inkbottle at his head, the man from Picardy, a
      sickly celibate, made plans of campaign, directed battles, armed princes,
      and roused whole peoples by sowing republican doctrines in the hearts of
      the burghers&mdash;recouping his continual defeats in the field by fresh
      progress in the mind of the nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal de Lorraine and the Duc de Guise, like Philip the Second and
      the Duke of Alba, knew where and when the monarchy was threatened, and how
      close the alliance ought to be between Catholicism and Royalty. Charles
      the Fifth, drunk with the wine of Charlemagne&rsquo;s cup, believing too blindly
      in the strength of his monarchy, and confident of sharing the world with
      Suleiman, did not at first feel the blow at his head; but no sooner had
      Cardinal Granvelle made him aware of the extent of the wound than he
      abdicated. The Guises had but one scheme,&mdash;that of annihilating
      heresy at a single blow. This blow they were now to attempt, for the first
      time, to strike at Amboise; failing there they tried it again, twelve
      years later, at the Saint-Bartholomew,&mdash;on the latter occasion in
      conjunction with Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, enlightened by that time by the
      flames of a twelve years&rsquo; war, enlightened above all by the significant
      word &ldquo;republic,&rdquo; uttered later and printed by the writers of the
      Reformation, but already foreseen (as we have said before) by Lecamus,
      that type of the Parisian bourgeoisie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Guises, now on the point of striking a murderous blow at the heart
      of the French nobility, in order to separate it once for all from a
      religious party whose triumph would be its ruin, still stood together on
      the terrace, concerting as to the best means of revealing their
      coup-d&rsquo;Etat to the king, while Catherine was talking with her counsellors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret knew what she was about when she declared herself
      protectress of the Huguenots! She has a battering-ram in the Reformation,
      and she knows how to use it,&rdquo; said the duke, who fathomed the deep designs
      of the Queen of Navarre, one of the great minds of the century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodore de Beze is now at Nerac,&rdquo; remarked the cardinal, &ldquo;after first
      going to Geneva to take Calvin&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What men these burghers know how to find!&rdquo; exclaimed the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we have none on our side of the quality of La Renaudie!&rdquo; cried the
      cardinal. &ldquo;He is a true Catiline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such men always act for their own interests,&rdquo; replied the duke. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
      fathom La Renaudie? I loaded him with favors; I helped him to escape when
      he was condemned by the parliament of Bourgogne; I brought him back from
      exile by obtaining a revision of his sentence; I intended to do far more
      for him; and all the while he was plotting a diabolical conspiracy against
      us! That rascal has united the Protestants of Germany with the heretics of
      France by reconciling the differences that grew up between the dogmas of
      Luther and those of Calvin. He has brought the discontented great
      seigneurs into the party of the Reformation without obliging them to
      abjure Catholicism openly. For the last year he has had thirty captains
      under him! He is everywhere at once,&mdash;at Lyon, in Languedoc, at
      Nantes! It was he who drew up those minutes of a consultation which were
      hawked about all Germany, in which the theologians declared that force
      might be resorted to in order to withdraw the king from our rule and
      tutelage; the paper is now being circulated from town to town. Wherever we
      look for him we never find him! And yet I have never done him anything but
      good! It comes to this, that we must now either thrash him like a dog, or
      try to throw him a golden bridge by which he will cross into our camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bretagne, Languedoc, in fact the whole kingdom is in league to deal us a
      mortal blow,&rdquo; said the cardinal. &ldquo;After the fete was over yesterday I
      spent the rest of the night in reading the reports sent me by the monks;
      in which I found that the only persons who have compromised themselves are
      poor gentlemen, artisans, as to whom it doesn&rsquo;t signify whether you hang
      them or let them live. The Colignys and Condes do not show their hand as
      yet, though they hold the threads of the whole conspiracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the duke, &ldquo;and, therefore, as soon as that lawyer Avenelles
      sold the secret of the plot, I told Braguelonne to let the conspirators
      carry it out. They have no suspicion that we know it; they are so sure of
      surprising us that the leaders may possibly show themselves then. My
      advice is to allow ourselves to be beaten for forty-eight hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour would be too much,&rdquo; cried the cardinal, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is your courage, is it?&rdquo; retorted the Balafre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, quite unmoved, replied: &ldquo;Whether the Prince de Conde is
      compromised or not, if we are certain that he is the leader, we should
      strike him down at once and secure tranquillity. We need judges rather
      than soldiers for this business&mdash;and judges are never lacking.
      Victory is always more certain in the parliament than on the field, and it
      costs less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consent, willingly,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;but do you think the Prince de
      Conde is powerful enough to inspire, himself alone, the audacity of those
      who are making this first attack upon us? Isn&rsquo;t there, behind him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king of Navarre,&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! a fool who speaks to me cap in hand!&rdquo; replied the duke. &ldquo;The
      coquetries of that Florentine woman seem to blind your eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for that,&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, &ldquo;if I do play the gallant with
      her it is only that I may read to the bottom of her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no heart,&rdquo; said the duke, sharply; &ldquo;she is even more ambitious
      than you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brave soldier,&rdquo; said the cardinal; &ldquo;but, believe me, I distance
      you in this matter. I have had Catherine watched by Mary Stuart long
      before you even suspected her. She has no more religion than my shoe; if
      she is not the soul of this plot it is not for want of will. But we shall
      now be able to test her on the scene itself, and find out then how she
      stands by us. Up to this time, however, I am certain she has held no
      communication whatever with the heretics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is time now to reveal the whole plot to the king, and to the
      queen-mother, who, you say, knows nothing of it,&mdash;that is the sole
      proof of her innocence; perhaps the conspirators have waited till the last
      moment, expecting to dazzle her with the probabilities of success. La
      Renaudie must soon discover by my arrangements that we are warned. Last
      night Nemours was to follow detachments of the Reformers who are pouring
      in along the cross-roads, and the conspirators will be forced to attack us
      at Amboise, which place I intend to let them enter. Here,&rdquo; added the duke,
      pointing to three sides of the rock on which the chateau de Blois is
      built; &ldquo;we should have an assault without any result; the Huguenots could
      come and go at will. Blois is an open hall with four entrances; whereas
      Amboise is a sack with a single mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not leave Catherine&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have made a blunder,&rdquo; remarked the duke, who was playing with his
      dagger, tossing it into the air and catching it by the hilt. &ldquo;We ought to
      have treated her as we did the Reformers,&mdash;given her complete freedom
      of action and caught her in the act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal looked at his brother for an instant and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Pardaillan want?&rdquo; said the duke, observing the approach of the
      young nobleman who was later to become celebrated by his encounter with La
      Renaudie, in which they both lost their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, a man sent by the queen&rsquo;s furrier is at the gate, and says
      he has an ermine suit to convey to her. Am I to let him enter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes,&mdash;the ermine coat she spoke of yesterday,&rdquo; returned the
      cardinal; &ldquo;let the shop-fellow pass; she will want the garment for the
      voyage down the Loire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he get here without being stopped until he reached the gate?&rdquo;
       asked the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Pardaillan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask to see him when he is with the queen,&rdquo; thought the Balafre. &ldquo;Let
      him wait in the <i>salle des gardes</i>,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Is he young,
      Pardaillan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur; he says he is a son of Lecamus the furrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lecamus is a good Catholic,&rdquo; remarked the cardinal, who, like his brother
      the duke, was endowed with Caesar&rsquo;s memory. &ldquo;The rector of
      Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs relies upon him; he is the provost of that
      quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;make the son talk with the captain of the
      Scotch guard,&rdquo; laying an emphasis on the verb which was readily
      understood. &ldquo;Ambroise is in the chateau; he can tell us whether the fellow
      is really the son of Lecamus, for the old man did him good service in
      times past. Send for Ambroise Pare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Queen Catherine went, unattended, toward the
      two brothers, who hastened to meet her with their accustomed show of
      respect, in which the Italian princess detected constant irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you deign to inform me of what is about to
      take place? Is the widow of your former master of less importance in your
      esteem than the Sieurs Vieilleville, Birago, and Chiverni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied the cardinal, in a tone of gallantry, &ldquo;our duty as men,
      taking precedence of that of statecraft, forbids us to alarm the fair sex
      by false reports. But this morning there is indeed good reason to confer
      with you on the affairs of the country. You must excuse my brother for
      having already given orders to the gentlemen you mention,&mdash;orders
      which were purely military, and therefore did not concern you; the matters
      of real importance are still to be decided. If you are willing, we will
      now go the <i>lever</i> of the king and queen; it is nearly time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is all this, Monsieur le duc?&rdquo; cried Catherine, pretending
      alarm. &ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reformation, madame, is no longer a mere heresy; it is a party, which
      has taken arms and is coming here to snatch the king away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, the cardinal, the duke, and the three gentlemen made their way
      to the staircase through the gallery, which was crowded with courtiers
      who, being off duty, no longer had the right of entrance to the royal
      apartments, and stood in two hedges on either side. Gondi, who watched
      them while the queen-mother talked with the Lorraine princes, whispered in
      her ear, in good Tuscan, two words which afterwards became proverbs,&mdash;words
      which are the keynote to one aspect of her regal character: &ldquo;Odiate e
      aspettate&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hate and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pardaillan, who had gone to order the officer of the guard at the gate of
      the chateau to let the clerk of the queen&rsquo;s furrier enter, found
      Christophe open-mouthed before the portal, staring at the facade built by
      the good king Louis XII., on which there was at that time a much greater
      number of grotesque carvings than we see there to-day,&mdash;grotesque,
      that is to say, if we may judge by those that remain to us. For instance,
      persons curious in such matters may remark the figurine of a woman carved
      on the capital of one of the portal columns, with her robe caught up to
      show to a stout monk crouching in the capital of the corresponding column
      &ldquo;that which Brunelle showed to Marphise&rdquo;; while above this portal stood,
      at the time of which we write, the statue of Louis XII. Several of the
      window-casings of this facade, carved in the same style, and now,
      unfortunately, destroyed, amused, or seemed to amuse Christophe, on whom
      the arquebusiers of the guard were raining jests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would like to live there,&rdquo; said the sub-corporal, playing with the
      cartridges of his weapon, which were prepared for use in the shape of
      little sugar-loaves, and slung to the baldricks of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Parisian!&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;you never saw the like of that, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He recognizes the good King Louis XII.,&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe pretended not to hear, and tried to exaggerate his amazement,
      the result being that his silly attitude and his behavior before the guard
      proved an excellent passport to the eyes of Pardaillan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen has not yet risen,&rdquo; said the young captain; &ldquo;come and wait for
      her in the <i>salle des gardes</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christophe followed Pardaillan rather slowly. On the way he stopped to
      admire the pretty gallery in the form of an arcade, where the courtiers of
      Louis XII. awaited the reception-hour when it rained, and where, at the
      present moment, were several seigneurs attached to the Guises; for the
      staircase (so well preserved to the present day) which led to their
      apartments is at the end of this gallery in a tower, the architecture of
      which commends itself to the admiration of intelligent beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! did you come here to study the carving of images?&rdquo; cried
      Pardaillan, as Christophe stopped before the charming sculptures of the
      balustrade which unites, or, if you prefer it, separates the columns of
      each arcade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe followed the young officer to the grand staircase, not without
      a glance of ecstasy at the semi-Moorish tower. The weather was fine, and
      the court was crowded with staff-officers and seigneurs, talking together
      in little groups,&mdash;their dazzling uniforms and court-dresses
      brightening a spot which the marvels of architecture, then fresh and new,
      had already made so brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said Pardaillan, making Lecamus a sign to follow him
      through a carved wooden door leading to the second floor, which the
      door-keeper opened on recognizing the young officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to imagine Christophe&rsquo;s amazement as he entered the great <i>salle
      des gardes</i>, then so vast that military necessity has since divided it
      by a partition into two chambers. It occupied on the second floor (that of
      the king), as did the corresponding hall on the first floor (that of the
      queen-mother), one third of the whole front of the chateau facing the
      courtyard; and it was lighted by two windows to right and two to left of
      the tower in which the famous staircase winds up. The young captain went
      to the door of the royal chamber, which opened upon this vast hall, and
      told one of the two pages on duty to inform Madame Dayelles, the queen&rsquo;s
      bedchamber woman, that the furrier was in the hall with her surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sign from Pardaillan Christophe placed himself near an officer, who
      was seated on a stool at the corner of a fireplace as large as his
      father&rsquo;s whole shop, which was at the end of the great hall, opposite to a
      precisely similar fireplace at the other end. While talking to this
      officer, a lieutenant, he contrived to interest him with an account of the
      stagnation of trade. Christophe seemed so thoroughly a shopkeeper that the
      officer imparted that conviction to the captain of the Scotch guard, who
      came in from the courtyard to question Lecamus, all the while watching him
      covertly and narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      However much Christophe Lecamus had been warned, it was impossible for him
      to really apprehend the cold ferocity of the interests between which
      Chaudieu had slipped him. To an observer of this scene, who had known the
      secrets of it as the historian understands it in the light of to-day,
      there was indeed cause to tremble for this young man,&mdash;the hope of
      two families,&mdash;thrust between those powerful and pitiless machines,
      Catherine and the Guises. But do courageous beings, as a rule, measure the
      full extent of their dangers? By the way in which the port of Blois, the
      chateau, and the town were guarded, Christophe was prepared to find spies
      and traps everywhere; and he therefore resolved to conceal the importance
      of his mission and the tension of his mind under the empty-headed and
      shopkeeping appearance with which he presented himself to the eyes of
      young Pardaillan, the officer of the guard, and the Scottish captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agitation which, in a royal castle, always attends the hour of the
      king&rsquo;s rising, was beginning to show itself. The great lords, whose
      horses, pages, or grooms remained in the outer courtyard,&mdash;for no
      one, except the king and the queens, had the right to enter the inner
      courtyard on horseback,&mdash;were mounting by groups the magnificent
      staircase, and filling by degrees the vast hall, the beams of which are
      now stripped of the decorations that then adorned them. Miserable little
      red tiles have replaced the ingenious mosaics of the floors; and the thick
      walls, then draped with the crown tapestries and glowing with all the arts
      of that unique period of the splendors of humanity, are now denuded and
      whitewashed! Reformers and Catholics were pressing in to hear the news and
      to watch faces, quite as much as to pay their duty to the king. Francois
      II.&lsquo;s excessive love for Mary Stuart, to which neither the queen-mother
      nor the Guises made any opposition, and the politic compliance of Mary
      Stuart herself, deprived the king of all regal power. At seventeen years
      of age he knew nothing of royalty but its pleasures, or of marriage beyond
      the indulgence of first passion. As a matter of fact, all present paid
      their court to Queen Mary and to her uncles, the Cardinal de Lorraine and
      the Duc de Guise, rather than to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stir took place before Christophe, who watched the arrival of each
      new personage with natural eagerness. A magnificent portiere, on either
      side of which stood two pages and two soldiers of the Scotch guard, then
      on duty, showed him the entrance to the royal chamber,&mdash;the chamber
      so fatal to the son of the present Duc de Guise, the second Balafre, who
      fell at the foot of the bed now occupied by Mary Stuart and Francois II.
      The queen&rsquo;s maids of honor surrounded the fireplace opposite to that where
      Christophe was being &ldquo;talked with&rdquo; by the captain of the guard. This
      second fireplace was considered the <i>chimney of honor</i>. It was built
      in the thick wall of the Salle de Conseil, between the door of the royal
      chamber and that of the council-hall, so that the maids of honor and the
      lords in waiting who had the right to be there were on the direct passage
      of the king and queen. The courtiers were certain on this occasion of
      seeing Catherine, for her maids of honor, dressed like the rest of the
      court ladies, in black, came up the staircase from the queen-mother&rsquo;s
      apartment, and took their places, marshalled by the Comtesse de Fiesque,
      on the side toward the council-hall and opposite to the maids of honor of
      the young queen, led by the Duchesse de Guise, who occupied the other side
      of the fireplace on the side of the royal bedroom. The courtiers left an
      open space between the ranks of these young ladies (who all belonged to
      the first families of the kingdom), which none but the greatest lords had
      the right to enter. The Comtesse de Fiesque and the Duchesse de Guise
      were, in virtue of their office, seated in the midst of these noble maids,
      who were all standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first gentleman who approached the dangerous ranks was the Duc
      d&rsquo;Orleans, the king&rsquo;s brother, who had come down from his apartment on the
      third floor, accompanied by Monsieur de Cypierre, his governor. This young
      prince, destined before the end of the year to reign under the title of
      Charles IX., was only ten years old and extremely timid. The Duc d&rsquo;Anjou
      and the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, his younger brothers, also the Princesse
      Marguerite, afterwards the wife of Henri IV. (la Reine Margot), were too
      young to come to court, and were therefore kept by their mother in her own
      apartments. The Duc d&rsquo;Orleans, richly dressed after the fashion of the
      times, in silken trunk-hose, a close-fitting jacket of cloth of gold
      embroidered with black flowers, and a little mantle of embroidered velvet,
      all black, for he still wore mourning for his father, bowed to the two
      ladies of honor and took his place beside his mother&rsquo;s maids. Already full
      of antipathy for the adherents of the house of Guise, he replied coldly to
      the remarks of the duchess and leaned his arm on the back of the chair of
      the Comtesse de Fiesque. His governor, Monsieur de Cypierre, one of the
      noblest characters of that day, stood beside him like a shield. Amyot
      (afterwards Bishop of Auxerre and translator of Plutarch), in the simple
      soutane of an abbe, also accompanied the young prince, being his tutor, as
      he was of the two other princes, whose affection became so profitable to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the &ldquo;chimney of honor&rdquo; and the other chimney at the end of the
      hall, around which were grouped the guards, their captain, a few
      courtiers, and Christophe carrying his box of furs, the Chancellor
      Olivier, protector and predecessor of l&rsquo;Hopital, in the robes which the
      chancellors of France have always worn, was walking up and down with the
      Cardinal de Tournon, who had recently returned from Rome. The pair were
      exchanging a few whispered sentences in the midst of great attention from
      the lords of the court, massed against the wall which separated the <i>salle
      des gardes</i> from the royal bedroom, like a living tapestry backed by
      the rich tapestry of art crowded by a thousand personages. In spite of the
      present grave events, the court presented the appearance of all courts in
      all lands, at all epochs, and in the midst of the greatest dangers. The
      courtiers talked of trivial matters, thinking of serious ones; they jested
      as they studied faces, and apparently concerned themselves about love and
      the marriage of rich heiresses amid the bloodiest catastrophes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of yesterday&rsquo;s fete?&rdquo; asked Bourdeilles, seigneur of
      Brantome, approaching Mademoiselle de Piennes, one of the queen-mother&rsquo;s
      maids of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs du Baif et du Bellay were inspired with delightful ideas,&rdquo; she
      replied, indicating the organizers of the fete, who were standing near. &ldquo;I
      thought it all in the worst taste,&rdquo; she added in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no part to play in it, I think?&rdquo; remarked Mademoiselle de
      Lewiston from the opposite ranks of Queen Mary&rsquo;s maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you reading there, madame?&rdquo; asked Amyot of the Comtesse de
      Fiesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Amadis de Gaule,&rsquo; by the Seigneur des Essarts, commissary in ordinary to
      the king&rsquo;s artillery,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming work,&rdquo; remarked the beautiful girl who was afterwards so
      celebrated under the name of Fosseuse when she was lady of honor to Queen
      Marguerite of Navarre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The style is a novelty in form,&rdquo; said Amyot. &ldquo;Do you accept such
      barbarisms?&rdquo; he added, addressing Brantome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They please the ladies, you know,&rdquo; said Brantome, crossing over to the
      Duchesse de Guise, who held the &ldquo;Decamerone&rdquo; in her hand. &ldquo;Some of the
      women of your house must appear in the book, madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a
      pity that the Sieur Boccaccio did not live in our day; he would have known
      plenty of ladies to swell his volume&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shrewd that Monsieur de Brantome is,&rdquo; said the beautiful Mademoiselle
      de Limueil to the Comtesse de Fiesque; &ldquo;he came to us first, but he means
      to remain in the Guise quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Madame de Fiesque glancing at the beautiful Limueil. &ldquo;Attend
      to what concerns yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl turned her eyes to the door. She was expecting Sardini, a
      noble Italian, with whom the queen-mother, her relative, married her after
      an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; which happened in the dressing-room of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici
      herself; but which the young lady won the honor of having a queen as
      midwife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the holy Alipantin! Mademoiselle Davila seems to me prettier and
      prettier every morning,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Robertet, secretary of State,
      bowing to the ladies of the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of the secretary of State made no commotion whatever, though
      his office was precisely what that of a minister is in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really think so, monsieur,&rdquo; said the beauty, &ldquo;lend me the squib
      which was written against the Messieurs de Guise; I know it was lent to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no longer in my possession,&rdquo; replied the secretary, turning round
      to bow to the Duchesse de Guise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said the Comte de Grammont to Mademoiselle Davila, &ldquo;but I
      will give it you on one condition only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condition! fie!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de Fiesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; replied Grammont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is easy to guess,&rdquo; remarked la Limueil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian custom of calling ladies, as peasants call their wives, &ldquo;<i>la</i>
      Such-a-one&rdquo; was then the fashion at the court of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said the count, hastily, &ldquo;the matter is simply to give
      a letter from my cousin de Jarnac to one of the maids on the other side,
      Mademoiselle de Matha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not compromise my young ladies,&rdquo; said the Comtesse de Fiesque.
      &ldquo;I will deliver the letter myself.&mdash;Do you know what is happening in
      Flanders?&rdquo; she continued, turning to the Cardinal de Tournon. &ldquo;It seems
      that Monsieur d&rsquo;Egmont is given to surprises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and the Prince of Orange,&rdquo; remarked Cypierre, with a significant shrug
      of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke of Alba and Cardinal Granvelle are going there, are they not,
      monsieur?&rdquo; said Amyot to the Cardinal de Tournon, who remained standing,
      gloomy and anxious between the opposing groups after his conversation with
      the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily we are at peace; we need only conquer heresy on the stage,&rdquo;
       remarked the young Duc d&rsquo;Orleans, alluding to a part he had played the
      night before,&mdash;that of a knight subduing a hydra which bore upon its
      foreheads the word &ldquo;Reformation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, agreeing in this with her daughter-in-law, had
      allowed a theatre to be made of the great hall (afterwards arranged for
      the Parliament of Blois), which, as we have already said, connected the
      chateau of Francois I. with that of Louis XII.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal made no answer to Amyot&rsquo;s question, but resumed his walk
      through the centre of the hall, talking in low tones with Monsieur de
      Robertet and the chancellor. Many persons are ignorant of the difficulties
      which secretaries of State (subsequently called ministers) met with at the
      first establishment of their office, and how much trouble the kings of
      France had in creating it. At this epoch a secretary of State like
      Robertet was purely and simply a writer; he counted for almost nothing
      among the princes and grandees who decided the affairs of State. His
      functions were little more than those of the superintendent of finances,
      the chancellor, and the keeper of the seals. The kings granted seats at
      the council by letters-patent to those of their subjects whose advice
      seemed to them useful in the management of public affairs. Entrance to the
      council was given in this way to a president of the Chamber of Parliament,
      to a bishop, or to an untitled favorite. Once admitted to the council, the
      subject strengthened his position there by obtaining various crown offices
      on which devolved such prerogatives as the sword of a Constable, the
      government of provinces, the grand-mastership of artillery, the baton of a
      marshal, a leading rank in the army, or the admiralty, or a captaincy of
      the galleys, often some office at court, like that of grand-master of the
      household, now held, as we have already said, by the Duc de Guise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that the Duc de Nemours will marry Francoise?&rdquo; said Madame
      de Guise to the tutor of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I know nothing but Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer made all who were within hearing of it smile. The seduction of
      Francoise de Rohan by the Duc de Nemours was the topic of all
      conversations; but, as the duke was cousin to Francois II., and doubly
      allied to the house of Valois through his mother, the Guises regarded him
      more as the seduced than the seducer. Nevertheless, the power of the house
      of Rohan was such that the Duc de Nemours was obliged, after the death of
      Francois II., to leave France on consequence of suits brought against him
      by the Rohans; which suits the Guises settled. The duke&rsquo;s marriage with
      the Duchesse de Guise after Poltrot&rsquo;s assassination of her husband in
      1563, may explain the question which she put to Amyot, by revealing the
      rivalry which must have existed between Mademoiselle de Rohan and the
      duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do see that group of the discontented over there?&rdquo; said the Comte de
      Grammont, motioning toward the Messieurs de Coligny, the Cardinal de
      Chatillon, Danville, Thore, Moret, and several other seigneurs suspected
      of tampering with the Reformation, who were standing between two windows
      on the other side of the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Huguenots are bestirring themselves,&rdquo; said Cypierre. &ldquo;We know that
      Theodore de Beze has gone to Nerac to induce the Queen of Navarre to
      declare for the Reformers&mdash;by abjuring publicly,&rdquo; he added, looking
      at the <i>bailli</i> of Orleans, who held the office of chancellor to the
      Queen of Navarre, and was watching the court attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will do it!&rdquo; said the <i>bailli</i>, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This personage, the Orleans Jacques Coeur, one of the richest burghers of
      the day, was named Groslot, and had charge of Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret&rsquo;s business
      with the court of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; said the chancellor of France, appreciating the
      full importance of Groslot&rsquo;s declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not aware,&rdquo; said the burgher, &ldquo;that the Queen of Navarre has
      nothing of the woman in her except sex? She is wholly for things virile;
      her powerful mind turns to the great affairs of State; her heart is
      invincible under adversity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le cardinal,&rdquo; whispered the Chancellor Olivier to Monsieur de
      Tournon, who had overheard Groslot, &ldquo;what do you think of that audacity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen of Navarre did well in choosing for her chancellor a man from
      whom the house of Lorraine borrows money, and who offers his house to the
      king, if his Majesty visits Orleans,&rdquo; replied the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chancellor and the cardinal looked at each other, without venturing to
      further communicate their thoughts; but Robertet expressed them, for he
      thought it necessary to show more devotion to the Guises than these great
      personages, inasmuch as he was smaller than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great misfortune that the house of Navarre, instead of abjuring
      the religion of its fathers, does not abjure the spirit of vengeance and
      rebellion which the Connetable de Bourbon breathed into it,&rdquo; he said
      aloud. &ldquo;We shall see the quarrels of the Armagnacs and the Bourguignons
      revive in our day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Groslot, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another Louis XI. in the Cardinal de
      Lorraine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also in Queen Catherine,&rdquo; replied Robertet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Madame Dayelle, the favorite bedchamber woman of Queen Mary
      Stuart, crossed the hall, and went toward the royal chamber. Her passage
      caused a general commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon enter,&rdquo; said Madame de Fisque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the Duchesse de Guise. &ldquo;Their Majesties will
      come out; a grand council is to be held.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VI. THE LITTLE LEVER OF FRANCOIS II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame Dayelle glided into the royal chamber after scratching on the door,&mdash;a
      respectful custom, invented by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and adopted by the
      court of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the weather, my dear Dayelle?&rdquo; said Queen Mary, showing her fresh
      young face out of the bed, and shaking the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my Dayelle? You look as if the archers of the guard
      were after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame, is the king still asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to leave the chateau; Monsieur le cardinal requests me to tell you
      so, and to ask you to make the king agree to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why, my good Dayelle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reformers want to seize you and carry you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that new religion does not leave me a minute&rsquo;s peace! I dreamed last
      night that I was in prison,&mdash;I, who will some day unite the crowns of
      the three noblest kingdoms in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore it could only be a dream, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry me off! well, &lsquo;twould be rather pleasant; but on account of
      religion, and by heretics&mdash;oh, that would be horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen sprang from the bed and placed herself in a large arm-chair of
      red velvet before the fireplace, after Dayelle had given her a
      dressing-gown of black velvet, which she fastened loosely round her waist
      by a silken cord. Dayelle lit the fire, for the mornings are cool on the
      banks of the Loire in the month of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncles must have received some news during the night?&rdquo; said the queen,
      inquiringly to Dayelle, whom she treated with great familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs de Guise have been walking together from early morning on the
      terrace, so as not to be overheard by any one; and there they received
      messengers, who came in hot haste from all the different points of the
      kingdom where the Reformers are stirring. Madame la reine mere was there
      too, with her Italians, hoping she would be consulted; but no, she was not
      admitted to the council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have been furious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more because she was so angry yesterday,&rdquo; replied Dayelle. &ldquo;They
      say that when she saw your Majesty appear in that beautiful dress of woven
      gold, with the charming veil of tan-colored crape, she was none too
      pleased&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us, my good Dayelle, the king is waking up. Let no one, even those
      who have the little <i>entrees</i>, disturb us; an affair of State is in
      hand, and my uncles will not disturb us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! my dear Mary, already out of bed? Is it daylight?&rdquo; said the young
      king, waking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear darling, while we were asleep the wicked waked, and now they are
      forcing us to leave this delightful place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think of wicked people, my treasure? I am sure we enjoyed
      the prettiest fete in the world last night&mdash;if it were not for the
      Latin words those gentlemen will put into our French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;your language is really in very good taste, and Rabelais
      exhibits it finely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are such a learned woman! I am so vexed that I can&rsquo;t sing your
      praises in verse. If I were not the king, I would take my brother&rsquo;s tutor,
      Amyot, and let him make me as accomplished as Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not envy your brother, who writes verses and shows them to me,
      asking for mine in return. You are the best of the four, and will make as
      good a king as you are the dearest of lovers. Perhaps that is why your
      mother does not like you! But never mind! I, dear heart, will love you for
      all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no great merit in loving such a perfect queen,&rdquo; said the little
      king. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what prevented me from kissing you before the whole
      court when you danced the <i>branle</i> with the torches last night! I saw
      plainly that all the other women were mere servants compared to you, my
      beautiful Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be only prose you speak, but it is ravishing speech, dear darling,
      for it is love that says those words. And you&mdash;you know well, my
      beloved, that were you only a poor little page, I should love you as much
      as I do now. And yet, there is nothing so sweet as to whisper to one&rsquo;s
      self: &lsquo;My lover is king!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the pretty arm! Why must we dress ourselves? I love to pass my
      fingers through your silky hair and tangle its blond curls. Ah ca! sweet
      one, don&rsquo;t let your women kiss that pretty throat and those white
      shoulders any more; don&rsquo;t allow it, I say. It is too much that the fogs of
      Scotland ever touched them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me to see my dear country? The Scotch love you; there
      are no rebellions <i>there</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who rebels in this our kingdom?&rdquo; said Francois, crossing his
      dressing-gown and taking Mary Stuart on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! &lsquo;tis all very charming, I know that,&rdquo; she said, withdrawing her cheek
      from the king; &ldquo;but it is your business to reign, if you please, my sweet
      sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why talk of reigning? This morning I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why say <i>wish</i> when you have only to will all? That&rsquo;s not the speech
      of a king, nor that of a lover.&mdash;But no more of love just now; let us
      drop it! We have business more important to speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;it is long since we have had any business. Is it
      amusing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;not at all; we are to move from Blois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager, darling, you have seen your uncles, who manage so well that
      I, at seventeen years of age, am no better than a <i>roi faineant</i>. In
      fact, I don&rsquo;t know why I have attended any of the councils since the
      first. They could manage matters just as well by putting the crown in my
      chair; I see only through their eyes, and am forced to consent to things
      blindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur,&rdquo; said the queen, rising from the king&rsquo;s knee with a little
      air of indignation, &ldquo;you said you would never worry me again on this
      subject, and that my uncles used the royal power only for the good of your
      people. Your people!&mdash;they are so nice! They would gobble you up like
      a strawberry if you tried to rule them yourself. You want a warrior, a
      rough master with mailed hands; whereas you&mdash;you are a darling whom I
      love as you are; whom I should never love otherwise,&mdash;do you hear me,
      monsieur?&rdquo; she added, kissing the forehead of the lad, who seemed inclined
      to rebel at her speech, but softened at her kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how I wish they were not your uncles!&rdquo; cried Francois II. &ldquo;I
      particularly dislike the cardinal; and when he puts on his wheedling air
      and his submissive manner and says to me, bowing: &lsquo;Sire, the honor of the
      crown and the faith of your fathers forbid your Majesty to&mdash;this and
      that,&rsquo; I am sure he is working only for his cursed house of Lorraine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how well you mimicked him!&rdquo; cried the queen. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you make
      the Guises inform you of what is going on, so that when you attain your
      grand majority you may know how to reign yourself? I am your wife, and
      your honor is mine. Trust me! we will reign together, my darling; but it
      won&rsquo;t be a bed of roses for us until the day comes when we have our own
      wills. There is nothing so difficult for a king as to reign. Am I a queen,
      for example? Don&rsquo;t you know that your mother returns me evil for all the
      good my uncles do to raise the splendor of your throne? Hey! what
      difference between them! My uncles are great princes, nephews of
      Charlemagne, filled with ardor and ready to die for you; whereas this
      daughter of a doctor or a shopkeeper, queen of France by accident, scolds
      like a burgher-woman who can&rsquo;t manage her own household. She is
      discontented because she can&rsquo;t set every one by the ears; and then she
      looks at me with a sour, pale face, and says from her pinched lips: &lsquo;My
      daughter, you are a queen; I am only the second woman in the kingdom&rsquo; (she
      is really furious, you know, my darling), &lsquo;but if I were in your place I
      should not wear crimson velvet while all the court is in mourning; neither
      should I appear in public with my own hair and no jewels, because what is
      not becoming in a simple lady is still less becoming in a queen. Also I
      should not dance myself, I should content myself with seeing others
      dance.&rsquo;&mdash;that is what she says to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;I think I hear her coming. If she were to know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how you tremble before her. She worries you. Only say so, and we will
      send her away. Faith, she&rsquo;s Florentine and we can&rsquo;t help her tricking you,
      but when it comes to worrying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Mary, hold your tongue!&rdquo; said Francois, frightened and
      also pleased; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to lose her good-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid that she will ever break with <i>me</i>, who will some
      day wear the three noblest crowns in the world, my dearest little king,&rdquo;
       cried Mary Stuart. &ldquo;Though she hates me for a thousand reasons she is
      always caressing me in the hope of turning me against my uncles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hates you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my angel; and if I had not proofs of that feeling such as women only
      understand, for they alone know its malignity, I would forgive her
      perpetual opposition to our dear love, my darling. Is it my fault that
      your father could not endure Mademoiselle Medici or that his son loves me?
      The truth is, she hates me so much that if you had not put yourself into a
      rage, we should each have had our separate chamber at Saint-Germain, and
      also here. She pretended it was the custom of the kings and queens of
      France. Custom, indeed! it was your father&rsquo;s custom, and that is easily
      understood. As for your grandfather, Francois, the good man set up the
      custom for the convenience of his loves. Therefore, I say, take care. And
      if we have to leave this place, be sure that we are not separated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Blois! Mary, what do you mean? I don&rsquo;t wish to leave this beautiful
      chateau, where we can see the Loire and the country all round us, with a
      town at our feet and all these pretty gardens. If I go away it will be to
      Italy with you, to see St. Peter&rsquo;s, and Raffaelle&rsquo;s pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the orange-trees? Oh! my darling king, if you knew the longing your
      Mary has to ramble among the orange-groves in fruit and flower!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, then!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; exclaimed the grand-master as he entered the room. &ldquo;Yes, sire, you
      must leave Blois. Pardon my boldness in entering your chamber; but
      circumstances are stronger than etiquette, and I come to entreat you to
      hold a council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding themselves thus surprised, Mary and Francois hastily separated,
      and on their faces was the same expression of offended royal majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too much of a grand-master, Monsieur de Guise,&rdquo; said the king,
      though controlling his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take lovers,&rdquo; murmured the cardinal in Catherine&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the queen-mother, appearing behind the cardinal; &ldquo;it is a
      matter concerning your safety and that of your kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heresy wakes while you have slept, sire,&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withdraw into the hall,&rdquo; cried the little king, &ldquo;and then we will hold a
      council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the grand-master to the young queen; &ldquo;the son of your
      furrier has brought some furs, which was just in time for the journey, for
      it is probable we shall sail down the Loire. But,&rdquo; he added, turning to
      the queen-mother, &ldquo;he also wishes to speak to you, madame. While the king
      dresses, you and Madame la reine had better see and dismiss him, so that
      we may not be delayed and harassed by this trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Catherine, thinking to herself, &ldquo;If he expects to get
      rid of me by any such trick he little knows me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal and the duke withdrew, leaving the two queens and the king
      alone together. As they crossed the <i>salle des gardes</i> to enter the
      council-chamber, the grand-master told the usher to bring the queen&rsquo;s
      furrier to him. When Christophe saw the usher approaching from the farther
      end of the great hall, he took him, on account of his uniform, for some
      great personage, and his heart sank within him. But that sensation,
      natural as it was at the approach of the critical moment, grew terrible
      when the usher, whose movement had attracted the eyes of all that
      brilliant assembly upon Christophe, his homely face and his bundles, said
      to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messeigneurs the Cardinal de Lorraine and the Grand-master wish to speak
      to you in the council chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have been betrayed?&rdquo; thought the helpless ambassador of the
      Reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe followed the usher with lowered eyes, which he did not raise
      till he stood in the great council-chamber, the size of which is almost
      equal to that of the <i>salle des gardes</i>. The two Lorrain princes were
      there alone, standing before the magnificent fireplace, which backs
      against that in the <i>salle des gardes</i> around which the ladies of the
      two queens were grouped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come from Paris; which route did you take?&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came by water, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you enter Blois?&rdquo; asked the grand-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the docks, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did no one question you?&rdquo; exclaimed the duke, who was watching the young
      man closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monseigneur. To the first soldier who looked as if he meant to stop
      me I said I came on duty to the two queens, to whom my father was
      furrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is happening in Paris?&rdquo; asked the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are still looking for the murderer of the President Minard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not the son of my surgeon&rsquo;s greatest friend?&rdquo; said the Duc de
      Guise, misled by the candor of Christophe&rsquo;s expression after his first
      alarm had passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Grand-master turned aside, abruptly raised the portiere which
      concealed the double door of the council-chamber, and showed his face to
      the whole assembly, among whom he was searching for the king&rsquo;s surgeon.
      Ambroise Pare, standing in a corner, caught a glance which the duke cast
      upon him, and immediately advanced. Ambroise, who at this time was
      inclined to the reformed religion, eventually adopted it; but the
      friendship of the Guises and that of the kings of France guaranteed him
      against the evils which overtook his co-religionists. The duke, who
      considered himself under obligations for life to Ambroise Pare, had lately
      caused him to be appointed chief-surgeon to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, monseigneur?&rdquo; said Ambroise. &ldquo;Is the king ill? I think it
      likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen is too pretty,&rdquo; replied the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the duke in astonishment. &ldquo;However, that is not the matter
      now,&rdquo; he added after a pause. &ldquo;Ambroise, I want you to see a friend of
      yours.&rdquo; So saying he drew him to the door of the council-room, and showed
      him Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! true, monseigneur,&rdquo; cried the surgeon, extending his hand to the
      young furrier. &ldquo;How is your father, my lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Maitre Ambroise,&rdquo; replied Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing at court?&rdquo; asked the surgeon. &ldquo;It is not your business
      to carry parcels; your father intends you for the law. Do you want the
      protection of these two great princes to make you a solicitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do!&rdquo; said Christophe; &ldquo;but I am here only in the interests of my
      father; and if you could intercede for us, please do so,&rdquo; he added in a
      piteous tone; &ldquo;and ask the Grand Master for an order to pay certain sums
      that are due to my father, for he is at his wit&rsquo;s end just now for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal and the duke glanced at each other and seemed satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now leave us,&rdquo; said the duke to the surgeon, making him a sign. &ldquo;And you
      my friend,&rdquo; turning to Christophe; &ldquo;do your errand quickly and return to
      Paris. My secretary will give you a pass, for it is not safe, <i>mordieu</i>,
      to be travelling on the high-roads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the brothers formed the slightest suspicion of the grave
      importance of Christophe&rsquo;s errand, convinced, as they now were, that he
      was really the son of the good Catholic Lecamus, the court furrier, sent
      to collect payment for their wares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him close to the door of the queen&rsquo;s chamber; she will probably ask
      for him soon,&rdquo; said the cardinal to the surgeon, motioning to Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the son of the furrier was undergoing this brief examination in the
      council-chamber, the king, leaving the queen in company with her
      mother-in-law, had passed into his dressing-room, which was entered
      through another small room next to the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in the wide recess of an immense window, Catherine looked at the
      gardens, her mind a prey to painful thoughts. She saw that in all
      probability one of the greatest captains of the age would be foisted that
      very day into the place and power of her son, the king of France, under
      the formidable title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. Before this
      peril she stood alone, without power of action, without defence. She might
      have been likened to a phantom, as she stood there in her mourning
      garments (which she had not quitted since the death of Henri II.) so
      motionless was her pallid face in the grasp of her bitter reflections. Her
      black eyes floated in that species of indecision for which great statesmen
      are so often blamed, though it comes from the vast extent of the glance
      with which they embrace all difficulties,&mdash;setting one against the
      other, and adding up, as it were, all chances before deciding on a course.
      Her ears rang, her blood tingled, and yet she stood there calm and
      dignified, all the while measuring in her soul the depths of the political
      abyss which lay before her, like the natural depths which rolled away at
      her feet. This day was the second of those terrible days (that of the
      arrest of the Vidame of Chartres being the first) which she was destined
      to meet in so great numbers throughout her regal life; it also witnessed
      her last blunder in the school of power. Though the sceptre seemed
      escaping from her hands, she wished to seize it; and she did seize it by a
      flash of that power of will which was never relaxed by either the disdain
      of her father-in-law, Francois I., and his court,&mdash;where, in spite of
      her rank of dauphiness, she had been of no account,&mdash;or the constant
      repulses of her husband, Henri II., and the terrible opposition of her
      rival, Diane de Poitiers. A man would never have fathomed this thwarted
      queen; but the fair-haired Mary&mdash;so subtle, so clever, so girlish,
      and already so well-trained&mdash;examined her out of the corners of her
      eyes as she hummed an Italian air and assumed a careless countenance.
      Without being able to guess the storms of repressed ambition which sent
      the dew of a cold sweat to the forehead of the Florentine, the pretty
      Scotch girl, with her wilful, piquant face, knew very well that the
      advancement of her uncle the Duc de Guise to the lieutenant-generalship of
      the kingdom was filling the queen-mother with inward rage. Nothing amused
      her more than to watch her mother-in-law, in whom she saw only an
      intriguing woman of low birth, always ready to avenge herself. The face of
      the one was grave and gloomy, and somewhat terrible, by reason of the
      livid tones which transform the skin of Italian women to yellow ivory by
      daylight, though it recovers its dazzling brilliancy under candlelight;
      the face of the other was fair and fresh and gay. At sixteen, Mary
      Stuart&rsquo;s skin had that exquisite blond whiteness which made her beauty so
      celebrated. Her fresh and piquant face, with its pure lines, shone with
      the roguish mischief of childhood, expressed in the regular eyebrows, the
      vivacious eyes, and the archness of the pretty mouth. Already she
      displayed those feline graces which nothing, not even captivity nor the
      sight of her dreadful scaffold, could lessen. The two queens&mdash;one at
      the dawn, the other in the midsummer of life&mdash;presented at this
      moment the utmost contrast. Catherine was an imposing queen, an
      impenetrable widow, without other passion than that of power. Mary was a
      light-hearted, careless bride, making playthings of her triple crowns. One
      foreboded great evils,&mdash;foreseeing the assassination of the Guises as
      the only means of suppressing enemies who were resolved to rise above the
      Throne and the Parliament; foreseeing also the bloodshed of a long and
      bitter struggle; while the other little anticipated her own judicial
      murder. A sudden and strange reflection calmed the mind of the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sorceress and Ruggiero both declare this reign is coming to an end;
      my difficulties will not last long,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, strangely enough, an occult science forgotten in our day&mdash;that
      of astrology&mdash;supported Catherine at this moment, as it did, in fact,
      throughout her life; for, as she witnessed the minute fulfilment of the
      prophecies of those who practised the art, her belief in it steadily
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very gloomy, madame,&rdquo; said Mary Stuart, taking from the hands of
      her waiting-woman, Dayelle, a little cap and placing the point of it on
      the parting of her hair, while two wings of rich lace surrounded the tufts
      of blond curls which clustered on her temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pencil of many painters have so frequently represented this head-dress
      that it is thought to have belonged exclusively to Mary Queen of Scots;
      whereas it was really invented by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, when she put on
      mourning for Henri II. But she never knew how to wear it with the grace of
      her daughter-in-law, to whom it was becoming. This annoyance was not the
      least among the many which the queen-mother cherished against the young
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the queen reproving me?&rdquo; said Catherine, turning to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe you all respect, and should not dare to do so,&rdquo; said the Scottish
      queen, maliciously, glancing at Dayelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed between the rival queens, the favorite waiting-woman stood rigid as
      an andiron; a smile of comprehension might have cost her her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be as gay as you, after losing the late king, and now beholding my
      son&rsquo;s kingdom about to burst into flames?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Public affairs do not concern women,&rdquo; said Mary Stuart. &ldquo;Besides, my
      uncles are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were, under the circumstances, like so many poisoned arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us look at our furs, madame,&rdquo; replied the Italian, sarcastically;
      &ldquo;that will employ us on our legitimate female affairs while your uncles
      decide those of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but we will go the Council, madame; we shall be more useful than you
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We!&rdquo; said Catherine, with an air of astonishment. &ldquo;But I do not
      understand Latin, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think me very learned,&rdquo; cried Mary Stuart, laughing, &ldquo;but I assure
      you, madame, I study only to reach the level of the Medici, and learn how
      to <i>cure</i> the wounds of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was silenced by this sharp thrust, which referred to the origin
      of the Medici, who were descended, some said, from a doctor of medicine,
      others from a rich druggist. She made no direct answer. Dayelle colored as
      her mistress looked at her, asking for the applause that even queens
      demand from their inferiors if there are no other spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your charming speeches, madame, will unfortunately cure the wounds of
      neither Church nor State,&rdquo; said Catherine at last, with her calm and cold
      dignity. &ldquo;The science of my fathers in that direction gave them thrones;
      whereas if you continue to trifle in the midst of danger you are liable to
      lose yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Ambroise Pare, the chief surgeon, scratched
      softly on the door, and Madame Dayelle, opening it, admitted Christophe.

    <h2>
      VII. A DRAMA IN A SURCOAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young reformer intended to study Catherine&rsquo;s face, all the while
      affecting a natural embarrassment at finding himself in such a place; but
      his proceedings were much hastened by the eagerness with which the younger
      queen darted to the cartons to see her surcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Christophe, addressing Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on the other queen and on Dayelle, instantly profiting
      by the attention the two women were eager to bestow upon the furs to play
      a bold stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; said Catherine giving him a searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe had put the treaty proposed by the Prince de Conde, the plan of
      the Reformers, and the detail of their forces in his bosom between his
      shirt and his cloth jacket, folding them, however, within the bill which
      Catherine owed to the furrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my father is in horrible need of money, and if you
      will deign to cast your eyes over your bill,&rdquo; here he unfolded the paper
      and put the treaty on the top of it, &ldquo;you will see that your Majesty owes
      him six thousand crowns. Have the goodness to take pity on us. See,
      madame!&rdquo; and he held the treaty out to her. &ldquo;Read it; the account dates
      from the time the late king came to the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was bewildered by the preamble of the treaty which met her eye,
      but she did not lose her head. She folded the paper quickly, admiring the
      audacity and presence of mind of the youth, and feeling sure that after
      performing such a masterly stroke he would not fail to understand her. She
      therefore tapped him on the head with the folded paper, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very clumsy of you, my little friend, to present your bill before
      the furs. Learn to know women. You must never ask us to pay until the
      moment when we are satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that traditional?&rdquo; said the young queen, turning to her mother-in-law,
      who made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, mesdames, pray excuse my father,&rdquo; said Christophe. &ldquo;If he had not had
      such need of money you would not have had your furs at all. The country is
      in arms, and there are so many dangers to run in getting here that nothing
      but our great distress would have brought me. No one but me was willing to
      risk them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad is new to his business,&rdquo; said Mary Stuart, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be useless, for the understanding of this trifling, but very
      important scene, to remark that a surcoat was, as the name implies (<i>sur
      cotte</i>), a species of close-fitting spencer which women wore over their
      bodies and down to their thighs, defining the figure. This garment
      protected the back, chest, and throat from cold. These surcoats were lined
      with fur, a band of which, wide or narrow as the case might be, bordered
      the outer material. Mary Stuart, as she tried the garment on, looked at
      herself in a large Venetian mirror to see the effect behind, thus leaving
      her mother-in-law an opportunity to examine the papers, the bulk of which
      might have excited the young queen&rsquo;s suspicions had she noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never tell women of the dangers you have run when you have come out of
      them safe and sound,&rdquo; she said, turning to show herself to Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame, I have your bill, too,&rdquo; he said, looking at her with
      well-played simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young queen eyed him, but did not take the paper; and she noticed,
      though without at the moment drawing any conclusions, that he had taken
      her bill from his pocket, whereas he had carried Queen Catherine&rsquo;s in his
      bosom. Neither did she find in the lad&rsquo;s eyes that glance of admiration
      which her presence invariably excited in all beholders. But she was so
      engrossed by her surcoat that, for the moment, she did not ask herself the
      meaning of such indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the bill, Dayelle,&rdquo; she said to her waiting-woman; &ldquo;give it to
      Monsieur de Versailles (Lomenie) and tell him from me to pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame,&rdquo; said Christophe, &ldquo;if you do not ask the king or monseigneur
      the grand-master to sign me an order your gracious word will have no
      effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather more eager than becomes a subject, my friend,&rdquo; said Mary
      Stuart. &ldquo;Do you not believe my royal word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king now appeared, in silk stockings and trunk-hose (the breeches of
      that period), but without his doublet and mantle; he had, however, a rich
      loose coat of velvet edged with minever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the wretch who dares to doubt your word?&rdquo; he said, overhearing, in
      spite of his distance, his wife&rsquo;s last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the dressing-room was hidden by the royal bed. This room was
      afterwards called &ldquo;the old cabinet,&rdquo; to distinguish it from the fine
      cabinet of pictures which Henri III. constructed at the farther end of the
      same suite of rooms, next to the hall of the States-general. It was in the
      old cabinet that Henri III. hid the murderers when he sent for the Duc de
      Guise, while he himself remained hidden in the new cabinet during the
      murder, only emerging in time to see the overbearing subject for whom
      there were no longer prisons, tribunals, judges, nor even laws, draw his
      last breath. Were it not for these terrible circumstances the historian of
      to-day could hardly trace the former occupation of these cabinets, now
      filled with soldiers. A quartermaster writes to his mistress on the very
      spot where the pensive Catherine once decided on her course between the
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, my friend,&rdquo; said the queen-mother, &ldquo;and I will see that you
      are paid. Commerce must live, and money is its backbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my lad,&rdquo; cried the young queen, laughing; &ldquo;my august mother knows
      more than I do about commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was about to leave the room without replying to this last taunt;
      but she remembered that her indifference to it might provoke suspicion,
      and she answered hastily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, my dear, understand the business of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she descended to her own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put away these furs, Dayelle, and let us go to the Council, monsieur,&rdquo;
       said Mary to the young king, enchanted with the opportunity of deciding in
      the absence of the queen-mother so important a question as the
      lieutenant-generalship of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Stuart took the king&rsquo;s arm. Dayelle went out before them, whispering
      to the pages; one of whom (it was young Teligny, who afterwards perished
      so miserably during the Saint-Bartholomew) cried out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words, the two soldiers of the guard presented arms, and the
      two pages went forward to the door of the Council-room through the lane of
      courtiers and that of the maids of honor of the two queens. All the
      members of the Council then grouped themselves about the door of their
      chamber, which was not very far from the door to the staircase. The
      grand-master, the cardinal, and the chancellor advanced to meet the young
      sovereign, who smiled to several of the maids of honor and replied to the
      remarks of a few courtiers more privileged than the rest. But the queen,
      evidently impatient, drew Francois II. as quickly as possible toward the
      Council-chamber. When the sound of arquebuses, dropping heavily on the
      floor, had announced the entrance of the couple, the pages replaced their
      caps upon their heads, and the private talk among the courtiers on the
      gravity of the matters now about to be discussed began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sent Chiverni to fetch the Connetable, but he has not come,&rdquo; said
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a single prince of the blood present,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chancellor and Monsieur de Tournon looked anxious,&rdquo; remarked a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grand-master sent word to the keeper of the seals to be sure not to
      miss this Council; therefore you may be certain they will issue
      letters-patent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does the queen-mother stay in her own apartments at such a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll cut out plenty of work for us,&rdquo; remarked Groslot to Cardinal de
      Chatillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, everybody had a word to say. Some went and came, in and out of
      the great hall; others hovered about the maids of honor of both queens, as
      if it might be possible to catch a few words through a wall three feet
      thick or through the double doors draped on each side with heavy curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at the upper end of a long table covered with blue velvet, which
      stood in the middle of the room, the king, near to whom the young queen
      was seated in an arm-chair, waited for his mother. Robertet, the
      secretary, was mending pens. The two cardinals, the grand-master, the
      chancellor, the keeper of the seals, and all the rest of the council
      looked at the little king, wondering why he did not give them the usual
      order to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Lorrain princes attributed the queen-mother&rsquo;s absence to some
      trick of their niece. Incited presently by a significant glance, the
      audacious cardinal said to his Majesty:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the king&rsquo;s good pleasure to begin the council without waiting for
      Madame la reine-mere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francois II., without daring to answer directly, said: &ldquo;Messieurs, be
      seated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal then explained succinctly the dangers of the situation. This
      great political character, who showed extraordinary ability under these
      pressing circumstances, led up to the question of the lieutenancy of the
      kingdom in the midst of the deepest silence. The young king doubtless felt
      the tyranny that was being exercised over him; he knew that his mother had
      a deep sense of the rights of the Crown and was fully aware of the danger
      that threatened his power; he therefore replied to a positive question
      addressed to him by the cardinal by saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will wait for the queen, my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly enlightened by the queen-mother&rsquo;s delay, Mary Stuart recalled, in
      a flash of thought, three circumstances which now struck her vividly;
      first, the bulk of the papers presented to her mother-in-law, which she
      had noticed, absorbed as she was,&mdash;for a woman who seems to see
      nothing is often a lynx; next, the place where Christophe had carried them
      to keep them separate from hers: &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; she thought to herself; and
      thirdly, she remembered the cold, indifferent glance of the young man,
      which she suddenly attributed to the hatred of the Reformers to a niece of
      the Guises. A voice cried to her, &ldquo;He may have been an emissary of the
      Huguenots!&rdquo; Obeying, like all excitable natures, her first impulse, she
      exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and fetch my mother myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she left the room hurriedly, ran down the staircase, to the amazement
      of the courtiers and the ladies of honor, entered her mother-in-law&rsquo;s
      apartments, crossed the guard-room, opened the door of the chamber with
      the caution of a thief, glided like a shadow over the carpet, saw no one,
      and bethought her that she should surely surprise the queen-mother in that
      magnificent dressing-room which comes between the bedroom and the oratory.
      The arrangement of this oratory, to which the manners of that period gave
      a role in private life like that of the boudoirs of our day, can still be
      traced.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an almost inexplicable chance, when we consider the state of
      dilapidation into which the Crown has allowed the chateau of Blois to
      fall, the admirable woodwork of Catherine&rsquo;s cabinet still exists; and in
      those delicately carved panels, persons interested in such things may
      still see traces of Italian splendor, and discover the secret
      hiding-places employed by the queen-mother. An exact description of these
      curious arrangements is necessary in order to give a clear understanding
      of what was now to happen. The woodwork of the oratory then consisted of
      about a hundred and eighty oblong panels, one hundred of which still
      exist, all presenting arabesques of different designs, evidently suggested
      by the most beautiful arabesques of Italy. The wood is live-oak. The red
      tones, seen through the layer of whitewash put on to avert cholera
      (useless precaution!), shows very plainly that the ground of the panels
      was formerly gilt. Certain portions of the design, visible where the wash
      has fallen away, seem to show that they once detached themselves from the
      gilded ground in colors, either blue, or red, or green. The multitude of
      these panels shows an evident intention to foil a search; but even if this
      could be doubted, the concierge of the chateau, while devoting the memory
      of Catherine to the execration of the humanity of our day, shows at the
      base of these panels and close to the floor a rather heavy foot-board,
      which can be lifted, and beneath which still remain the ingenious springs
      which move the panels. By pressing a knob thus hidden, the queen was able
      to open certain panels known to her alone, behind which, sunk in the wall,
      were hiding-places, oblong like the panels, and more or less deep. It is
      difficult, even in these days of dilapidation, for the best-trained eye to
      detect which of those panels is thus hinged; but when the eye was
      distracted by colors and gilding, cleverly used to conceal the joints, we
      can readily conceive that to find one or two such panels among two hundred
      was almost an impossible thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Mary Stuart laid her hand on the somewhat complicated
      lock of the door of this oratory, the queen-mother, who had just become
      convinced of the greatness of the Prince de Conde&rsquo;s plans, had touched the
      spring hidden beneath the foot-board, and one of the mysterious panels had
      turned over on its hinges. Catherine was in the act of lifting the papers
      from the table to hide them, intending after that to secure the safety of
      the devoted messenger who had brought them to her, when, hearing the
      sudden opening of the door, she at once knew that none but Queen Mary
      herself would dare thus to enter without announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lost!&rdquo; she said to Christophe, perceiving that she could no
      longer put away the papers, nor close with sufficient rapidity the open
      panel, the secret of which was now betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe answered her with a glance that was sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Povero mio</i>!&rdquo; said Catherine, before she looked at her
      daughter-in-law. &ldquo;Treason, madame! I hold the traitors at last,&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Send for the duke and the cardinal; and see that that man,&rdquo;
       pointing to Christophe, &ldquo;does not escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the able woman had seen the necessity of sacrificing the
      poor youth. She could not hide him; it was impossible to save him. Eight
      days earlier it might have been done; but the Guises now knew of the plot;
      they must already possess the lists she held in her hand, and were
      evidently drawing the Reformers into a trap. Thus, rejoiced to find in
      these adversaries the very spirit she desired them to have, her policy now
      led her to make a merit of the discovery of their plot. These horrible
      calculations were made during the rapid moment while the young queen was
      opening the door. Mary Stuart stood dumb for an instant; the gay look left
      her eyes, which took on the acuteness that suspicion gives to the eyes of
      all, and which, in hers, became terrible from the suddenness of the
      change. She glanced from Christophe to the queen-mother and from the
      queen-mother back to Christophe,&mdash;her face expressing malignant
      doubt. Then she seized a bell, at the sound of which one of the
      queen-mother&rsquo;s maids of honor came running in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle du Rouet, send for the captain of the guard,&rdquo; said Mary
      Stuart to the maid of honor, contrary to all etiquette, which was
      necessarily violated under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the young queen gave this order, Catherine looked intently at
      Christophe, as if saying to him, &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reformer understood, and replied by another glance, which seemed to
      say, &ldquo;Sacrifice me, as <i>they</i> have sacrificed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely on me,&rdquo; said Catherine by a gesture. Then she absorbed herself in
      the documents as her daughter-in-law turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong to the Reformed religion?&rdquo; inquired Mary Stuart of Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not mistaken,&rdquo; she murmured as she again noticed in the eyes of the
      young Reformer the same cold glance in which dislike was hidden beneath an
      expression of humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardaillan suddenly appeared, sent by the two Lorrain princes and by the
      king to escort the queens. The captain of the guard called for by Mary
      Stuart followed the young officer, who was devoted to the Guises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell the king and the grand-master and the cardinal, from me, to
      come here at once, and say that I should not take the liberty of sending
      for them if something of the utmost importance had not occurred. Go,
      Pardaillan.&mdash;As for you, Lewiston, keep guard over that traitor of a
      Reformer,&rdquo; she said to the Scotchman in his mother-tongue, pointing to
      Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young queen and queen-mother maintained a total silence until the
      arrival of the king and princes. The moments that elapsed were terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Stuart had betrayed to her mother-in-law, in its fullest extent, the
      part her uncles were inducing her to play; her constant and habitual
      distrust and espionage were now revealed, and her young conscience told
      her how dishonoring to a great queen was the work that she was doing.
      Catherine, on the other hand, had yielded out of fear; she was still
      afraid of being rightly understood, and she trembled for her future. Both
      women, one ashamed and angry, the other filled with hatred and yet calm,
      went to the embrasure of the window and leaned against the casing, one to
      right, the other to left, silent; but their feelings were expressed in
      such speaking glances that they averted their eyes and, with mutual
      artfulness, gazed through the window at the sky. These two great and
      superior women had, at this crisis, no greater art of behavior than the
      vulgarest of their sex. Perhaps it is always thus when circumstances arise
      which overwhelm the human being. There is, inevitably, a moment when
      genius itself feels its littleness in presence of great catastrophes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Christophe, he was like a man in the act of rolling down a
      precipice. Lewiston, the Scotch captain, listened to this silence,
      watching the son of the furrier and the two queens with soldierly
      curiosity. The entrance of the king and Mary Stuart&rsquo;s two uncles put an
      end to the painful situation.

    <h2>
      VIII. MARTYRDOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cardinal went straight to the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold the threads of the conspiracy of the heretics,&rdquo; said Catherine.
      &ldquo;They have sent me this treaty and these documents by the hands of that
      child,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time that Catherine was explaining matters to the cardinal,
      Queen Mary whispered a few words to the grand-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this about?&rdquo; asked the young king, who was left alone in the
      midst of the violent clash of interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proofs of what I was telling to your Majesty have not been long in
      reaching us,&rdquo; said the cardinal, who had grasped the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duc de Guise drew his brother aside without caring that he interrupted
      him, and said in his ear, &ldquo;This makes me lieutenant-general without
      opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shrewd glance was the cardinal&rsquo;s only answer; showing his brother that
      he fully understood the advantages to be gained from Catherine&rsquo;s false
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you here?&rdquo; said the duke to Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chaudieu, the minister,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, you lie!&rdquo; said the soldier, sharply; &ldquo;it was the Prince de
      Conde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince de Conde, monseigneur!&rdquo; replied Christophe, with a puzzled
      look. &ldquo;I never met him. I am studying law with Monsieur de Thou; I am his
      secretary, and he does not know that I belong to the Reformed religion. I
      yielded only to the entreaties of the minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; exclaimed the cardinal. &ldquo;Call Monsieur de Robertet,&rdquo; he said to
      Lewiston, &ldquo;for this young scamp is slyer than an old statesman; he has
      managed to deceive my brother, and me too; an hour ago I would have given
      him the sacrament without confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a child, <i>morbleu</i>!&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll treat
      you as a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heretics have attempted to beguile your august mother,&rdquo; said the
      cardinal, addressing the king, and trying to draw him apart to win him
      over to their ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the queen-mother to her son, assuming a reproachful look and
      stopping the king at the moment when the cardinal was leading him into the
      oratory to subject him to his dangerous eloquence, &ldquo;you see the result of
      the situation in which I am; they think me irritated by the little
      influence that I have in public affairs,&mdash;I, the mother of four
      princes of the house of Valois!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young king listened attentively. Mary Stuart, seeing the frown upon
      his brow, took his arm and led him away into the recess of the window,
      where she cajoled him with sweet speeches in a low voice, no doubt like
      those she had used that morning in their chamber. The two Guises read the
      documents given up to them by Catherine. Finding that they contained
      information which their spies, and Monsieur Braguelonne, the lieutenant of
      the Chatelet, had not obtained, they were inclined to believe in the
      sincerity of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. Robertet came and received certain
      secret orders relative to Christophe. The youthful instrument of the
      leaders of the Reformation was then led away by four soldiers of the
      Scottish guard, who took him down the stairs and delivered him to Monsieur
      de Montresor, provost of the chateau. That terrible personage himself,
      accompanied by six of his men, conducted Christophe to the prison in the
      vaulted cellar of the tower, now in ruins, which the concierge of the
      chateau de Blois shows you with the information that these were the
      dungeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      After such an event the Council could be only a formality. The king, the
      young queen, the Grand-master, and the cardinal returned to it, taking
      with them the vanquished Catherine, who said no word except to approve the
      measures proposed by the Guises. In spite of a slight opposition from the
      Chancelier Olivier (the only person present who said one word that
      expressed the independence to which his office bound him), the Duc de
      Guise was appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom. Robertet brought
      the required documents, showing a devotion which might be called
      collusion. The king, giving his arm to his mother, recrossed the <i>salle
      des gardes</i>, announcing to the court as he passed along that on the
      following day he should leave Blois for the chateau of Amboise. The latter
      residence had been abandoned since the time when Charles VIII.
      accidentally killed himself by striking his head against the casing of a
      door on which he had ordered carvings, supposing that he could enter
      without stooping below the scaffolding. Catherine, to mask the plans of
      the Guises, remarked aloud that they intended to complete the chateau of
      Amboise for the Crown at the same time that her own chateau of Chemonceaux
      was finished. But no one was the dupe of that pretext, and all present
      awaited great events.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending about two hours endeavoring to see where he was in the
      obscurity of the dungeon, Christophe ended by discovering that the place
      was sheathed in rough woodwork, thick enough to make the square hole into
      which he was put both healthy and habitable. The door, like that of a
      pig-pen, was so low that he stooped almost double on entering it. Beside
      this door was a heavy iron grating, opening upon a sort of corridor, which
      gave a little light and a little air. This arrangement, in all respects
      like that of the dungeons of Venice, showed plainly that the architecture
      of the chateau of Blois belonged to the Venetian school, which during the
      Middle Ages, sent so many builders into all parts of Europe. By tapping
      this species of pit above the woodwork Christophe discovered that the
      walls which separated his cell to right and left from the adjoining ones
      were made of brick. Striking one of them to get an idea of its thickness,
      he was somewhat surprised to hear return blows given on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said his neighbor, speaking to him through the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Christophe Lecamus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied the voice, &ldquo;am Captain Chaudieu, brother of the minister. I
      was taken prisoner to-night at Beaugency; but, luckily, there is nothing
      against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is discovered,&rdquo; said Christophe; &ldquo;you are fortunate to be saved from
      the fray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have three thousand men at this moment in the forests of the
      Vendomois, all determined men, who mean to abduct the king and the
      queen-mother during their journey. Happily La Renaudie was cleverer than
      I; he managed to escape. You had only just left us when the Guise men
      surprised us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know La Renaudie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! my brother has told me all about it,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that, Christophe sat down upon his bench and made no further
      answer to the pretended captain, for he knew enough of the police to be
      aware how necessary it was to act with prudence in a prison. In the middle
      of the night he saw the pale light of a lantern in the corridor, after
      hearing the ponderous locks of the iron door which closed the cellar groan
      as they were turned. The provost himself had come to fetch Christophe.
      This attention to a prisoner who had been left in his dark dungeon for
      hours without food, struck the poor lad as singular. One of the provost&rsquo;s
      men bound his hands with a rope and held him by the end of it until they
      reached one of the lower halls of the chateau of Louis XII., which was
      evidently the antechamber to the apartments of some important personage.
      The provost and his men bade him sit upon a bench, and the man then bound
      his feet as he had before bound his hands. On a sign from Monsieur de
      Montresor the man left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me, my friend,&rdquo; said the provost-marshal, toying with the
      collar of the Order; for, late as the hour was, he was in full uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little circumstance gave the young man several thoughts; he saw that
      all was not over; on the contrary, it was evidently neither to hang nor
      yet to condemn him that he was brought here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, you may spare yourself cruel torture by telling me all you
      know of the understanding between Monsieur le Prince de Conde and Queen
      Catherine. Not only will no harm be done to you, but you shall enter the
      service of Monseigneur the lieutenant-general of the kingdom, who likes
      intelligent men and on whom your honest face has produced a good
      impression. The queen-mother is about to be sent back to Florence, and
      Monsieur de Conde will no doubt be brought to trial. Therefore, believe
      me, humble folks ought to attach themselves to the great men who are in
      power. Tell me all; and you will find your profit in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Christophe; &ldquo;I have nothing to tell. I told all
      I know to Messieurs de Guise in the queen&rsquo;s chamber. Chaudieu persuaded me
      to put those papers under the eyes of the queen-mother; assuring me that
      they concerned the peace of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never seen the Prince de Conde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Monsieur de Montresor left Christophe and went into the
      adjoining room; but the youth was not left long alone. The door through
      which he had been brought opened and gave entrance to several men, who did
      not close it. Sounds that were far from reassuring were heard from the
      courtyard; men were bringing wood and machinery, evidently intended for
      the punishment of the Reformer&rsquo;s messenger. Christophe&rsquo;s anxiety soon had
      matter for reflection in the preparations which were made in the hall
      before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two coarse and ill-dressed serving-men obeyed the orders of a stout,
      squat, vigorous man, who cast upon Christophe, as he entered, the glance
      of a cannibal upon his victim; he looked him over and <i>estimated</i>
      him,&mdash;measuring, like a connoisseur, the strength of his nerves,
      their power and their endurance. The man was the executioner of Blois.
      Coming and going, his assistants brought in a mattress, several mallets
      and wooden wedges, also planks and other articles, the use of which was
      not plain, nor their look comforting to the poor boy concerned in these
      preparations, whose blood now curdled in his veins from a vague but most
      terrible apprehension. Two personages entered the hall at the moment when
      Monsieur de Montresor reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, nothing ready!&rdquo; cried the provost-marshal, to whom the new-comers
      bowed with great respect. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; he said, addressing the stout
      man and his two assistants, &ldquo;that Monseigneur the cardinal thinks you
      already at work? Doctor,&rdquo; added the provost, turning to one of the
      new-comers, &ldquo;this is the man&rdquo;; and he pointed to Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went straight to the prisoner, unbound his hands, and struck
      him on the breast and back. Science now continued, in a serious manner,
      the truculent examination of the executioner&rsquo;s eye. During this time a
      servant in the livery of the house of Guise brought in several arm-chairs,
      a table, and writing-materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin the <i>proces verbal</i>,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Montresor, motioning to
      the table the second personage, who was dressed in black, and was
      evidently a clerk. Then the provost went up to Christophe, and said to him
      in a very gentle way: &ldquo;My friend, the chancellor, having learned that you
      refuse to answer me in a satisfactory manner, decrees that you be put to
      the question, ordinary and extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in good health, and can he bear it?&rdquo; said the clerk to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the latter, who was one of the physicians of the house of
      Lorraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, retire to the next room; we will send for you whenever we
      require your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician left the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first terror having passed, Christophe rallied his courage; the hour
      of his martyrdom had come. Thenceforth he looked with cold curiosity at
      the arrangements that were made by the executioner and his men. After
      hastily preparing a bed, the two assistants got ready certain appliances
      called <i>boots</i>; which consisted of several planks, between which each
      leg of the victim was placed. The legs thus placed were brought close
      together. The apparatus used by binders to press their volumes between two
      boards, which they fasten by cords, will give an exact idea of the manner
      in which each leg of the prisoner was bound. We can imagine the effect
      produced by the insertion of wooden wedges, driven in by hammers between
      the planks of the two bound legs,&mdash;the two sets of planks of course
      not yielding, being themselves bound together by ropes. These wedges were
      driven in on a line with the knees and the ankles. The choice of these
      places where there is little flesh, and where, consequently, the wedge
      could only be forced in by crushing the bones, made this form of torture,
      called the &ldquo;question,&rdquo; horribly painful. In the &ldquo;ordinary question&rdquo; four
      wedges were driven in,&mdash;two at the knees, two at the ankles; but in
      the &ldquo;extraordinary question&rdquo; the number was increased to eight, provided
      the doctor certified that the prisoner&rsquo;s vitality was not exhausted. At
      the time of which we write the &ldquo;boots&rdquo; were also applied in the same
      manner to the hands and wrists; but, being pressed for time, the cardinal,
      the lieutenant-general, and the chancellor spared Christophe that
      additional suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>proces verbal</i> was begun; the provost dictated a few sentences
      as he walked up and down with a meditative air, asking Christophe his
      name, baptismal name, age, and profession; then he inquired the name of
      the person from whom he had received the papers he had given to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the minister Chaudieu,&rdquo; answered Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he give them to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In giving them to you he must have told you whether the queen-mother
      would receive you with pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me nothing of that kind,&rdquo; said Christophe. &ldquo;He merely asked me to
      give them to Queen Catherine secretly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have seen Chaudieu frequently, or he would not have known that
      you were going to Blois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minister did not know from me that in carrying furs to the queen I
      was also to ask on my father&rsquo;s behalf for the money the queen-mother owes
      him; and I did not have time to ask the minister who had told him of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these papers, which were given to you without being sealed or
      enveloped, contained a treaty between the rebels and Queen Catherine. You
      must have seen that they exposed you to the punishment of all those who
      assist in a rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The persons who persuaded you to this act of high treason must have
      promised you rewards and the protection of the queen-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it out of attachment to Chaudieu, the only person whom I saw in the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you persist in saying you did not see the Prince de Conde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince de Conde did not tell you that the queen-mother was inclined
      to enter into his views against the Messieurs de Guise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! one of your accomplices, La Renaudie, has been arrested.
      Strong as he is, he was not able to bear the &lsquo;question,&rsquo; which will now be
      put to you; he confessed at last that both he and the Prince de Conde had
      an interview with you. If you wish to escape the torture of the question,
      I exhort you to tell me the simple truth. Perhaps you will thus obtain
      your full pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christophe answered that he could not state a thing of which he had no
      knowledge, or give himself accomplices when he had none. Hearing these
      words, the provost-marshal signed to the executioner and retired himself
      to the inner room. At that fatal sign Christophe&rsquo;s brows contracted, his
      forehead worked with nervous convulsion, as he prepared himself to suffer.
      His hands closed with such violence that the nails entered the flesh
      without his feeling them. Three men seized him, took him to the camp bed
      and laid him there, letting his legs hang down. While the executioner
      fastened him to the rough bedstead with strong cords, the assistants bound
      his legs into the &ldquo;boots.&rdquo; Presently the cords were tightened, by means of
      a wrench, without the pressure causing much pain to the young Reformer.
      When each leg was thus held as it were in a vice, the executioner grasped
      his hammer and picked up the wedges, looking alternately at the victim and
      at the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you persist in your denial?&rdquo; asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told the truth,&rdquo; replied Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Go on,&rdquo; said the clerk, closing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cords were tightened with great force. This was perhaps the most
      painful moment of the torture; the flesh being suddenly compressed, the
      blood rushed violently toward the breast. The poor boy could not restrain
      a dreadful cry and seemed about to faint. The doctor was called in. After
      feeling Christophe&rsquo;s pulse, he told the executioner to wait a quarter of
      an hour before driving the first wedge in, to let the action of the blood
      subside and allow the victim to recover his full sensitiveness. The clerk
      suggested, kindly, that if he could not bear this beginning of sufferings
      which he could not escape, it would be better to reveal all at once; but
      Christophe made no reply except to say, &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s tailor! the king&rsquo;s
      tailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by those words?&rdquo; asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing what torture I must bear,&rdquo; said Christophe, slowly, hoping to gain
      time to rest, &ldquo;I call up all my strength, and try to increase it by
      thinking of the martyrdom borne by the king&rsquo;s tailor for the holy cause of
      the Reformation, when the question was applied to him in presence of
      Madame la Duchesse de Valentinois and the king. I shall try to be worthy
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the physician exhorted the unfortunate lad not to force them to have
      recourse to more violent measures, the cardinal and the duke, impatient to
      know the result of the interrogations, entered the hall and themselves
      asked Christophe to speak the truth, immediately. The young man repeated
      the only confession he had allowed himself to make, which implicated no
      one but Chaudieu. The princes made a sign, on which the executioner and
      his assistant seized their hammers, taking each a wedge, which then they
      drove in between the joints, standing one to right, the other to left of
      their victim; the executioner&rsquo;s wedge was driven in at the knees, his
      assistant&rsquo;s at the ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of all present fastened on those of Christophe, and he, no doubt
      excited by the presence of those great personages, shot forth such burning
      glances that they appeared to have all the brilliancy of flame. As the
      third and fourth wedges were driven in, a dreadful groan escaped him. When
      he saw the executioner take up the wedges for the &ldquo;extraordinary question&rdquo;
       he said no word and made no sound, but his eyes took on so terrible a
      fixity, and he cast upon the two great princes who were watching him a
      glance so penetrating, that the duke and cardinal were forced to drop
      their eyes. Philippe le Bel met with the same resistance when the torture
      of the pendulum was applied in his presence to the Templars. That
      punishment consisted in striking the victim on the breast with one arm of
      the balance pole with which money is coined, its end being covered with a
      pad of leather. One of the knights thus tortured, looked so intently at
      the king that Philippe could not detach his eyes from him. At the third
      blow the king left the chamber on hearing the knight summon him to appear
      within a year before the judgment-seat of God,&mdash;as, in fact, he did.
      At the fifth blow, the first of the &ldquo;extraordinary question,&rdquo; Christophe
      said to the cardinal: &ldquo;Monseigneur, put an end to my torture; it is
      useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal and the duke re-entered the adjoining hall, and Christophe
      distinctly heard the following words said by Queen Catherine: &ldquo;Go on;
      after all, he is only a heretic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She judged it prudent to be more stern to her accomplice than the
      executioners themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sixth and seventh wedges were driven in without a word of complaint
      from Christophe. His face shone with extraordinary brilliancy, due, no
      doubt, to the excess of strength which his fanatic devotion gave him.
      Where else but in the feelings of the soul can we find the power necessary
      to bear such sufferings? Finally, he smiled when he saw the executioner
      lifting the eighth and last wedge. This horrible torture had lasted by
      this time over an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk now went to call the physician that he might decide whether the
      eighth wedge could be driven in without endangering the life of the
      victim. During this delay the duke returned to look at Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ventre-de-biche</i>! you are a fine fellow,&rdquo; he said to him, bending
      down to whisper the words. &ldquo;I love brave men. Enter my service, and you
      shall be rich and happy; my favors shall heal those wounded limbs. I do
      not propose to you any baseness; I will not ask you to return to your
      party and betray its plans,&mdash;there are always traitors enough for
      that, and the proof is in the prisons of Blois; tell me only on what terms
      are the queen-mother and the Prince de Conde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Christophe Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician came, examined the victim, and said that he could bear the
      eighth wedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then insert it,&rdquo; said the cardinal. &ldquo;After all, as the queen says, he is
      only a heretic,&rdquo; he added, looking at Christophe with a dreadful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Catherine came with slow steps from the adjoining apartment
      and stood before Christophe, coldly observing him. Instantly she was the
      object of the closest attention on the part of the two brothers, who
      watched alternately the queen and her accomplice. On this solemn test the
      whole future of that ambitious woman depended; she felt the keenest
      admiration for Christophe, yet she gazed sternly at him; she hated the
      Guises, and she smiled upon them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;confess that you have seen the Prince de
      Conde, and you will be richly rewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what a business this is for you, madame!&rdquo; cried Christophe, pitying
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He insults me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do you not hang him?&rdquo; she cried,
      turning to the two brothers, who stood thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a woman!&rdquo; said the duke in a glance at his brother, consulting him
      by his eye, and leading him to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay in France and be revenged upon them,&rdquo; thought the queen.
      &ldquo;Come, make him confess, or let him die!&rdquo; she said aloud, addressing
      Montresor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost-marshal turned away his eyes, the executioners were busy with
      the wedges; Catherine was free to cast one glance upon the martyr, unseen
      by others, which fell on Christophe like the dew. The eyes of the great
      queen seemed to him moist; two tears were in them, but they did not fall.
      The wedges were driven; a plank was broken by the blow. Christophe gave
      one dreadful cry, after which he was silent; his face shone,&mdash;he
      believed he was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him die?&rdquo; said the cardinal, echoing the queen&rsquo;s last words with a
      sort of irony; &ldquo;no, no! don&rsquo;t break that thread,&rdquo; he said to the provost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke and the cardinal consulted together in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with him?&rdquo; asked the executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him to the prison at Orleans,&rdquo; said the duke, addressing Monsieur de
      Montresor; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t hang him without my order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The extreme sensitiveness to which Christophe&rsquo;s internal organism had been
      brought, increased by a resistance which called into play every power of
      the human body, existed to the same degree, in his senses. He alone heard
      the following words whispered by the Duc de Guise in the ear of his
      brother the cardinal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give up all hope of getting the truth out of that little fellow
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the princes had left the hall the executioners unbound the legs of
      their victim roughly and without compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any one ever see a criminal with such strength?&rdquo; said the chief
      executioner to his aids. &ldquo;The rascal bore that last wedge when he ought to
      have died; I&rsquo;ve lost the price of his body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbind me gently; don&rsquo;t make me suffer, friends,&rdquo; said poor Christophe.
      &ldquo;Some day I will reward you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, show some humanity,&rdquo; said the physician. &ldquo;Monseigneur esteems
      the young man, and told me to look after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Amboise with my assistants,&mdash;take care of him
      yourself,&rdquo; said the executioner, brutally. &ldquo;Besides, here comes the
      jailer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The executioner departed, leaving Christophe in the hands of the
      soft-spoken doctor, who by the aid of Christophe&rsquo;s future jailer, carried
      the poor boy to a bed, brought him some broth, helped him to swallow it,
      sat down beside him, felt his pulse, and tried to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t die of this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ought to feel great inward comfort,
      knowing that you have done your duty.&mdash;The queen-mother bids me take
      care of you,&rdquo; he added in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen is very good,&rdquo; said Christophe, whose terrible sufferings had
      developed an extraordinary lucidity in his mind, and who, after enduring
      such unspeakable sufferings, was determined not to compromise the results
      of his devotion. &ldquo;But she might have spared me much agony be telling my
      persecutors herself the secrets that I know nothing about, instead of
      urging them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that reply, the doctor took his cap and cloak and left Christophe,
      rightly judging that he could worm nothing out of a man of that stamp. The
      jailer of Blois now ordered the poor lad to be carried away on a stretcher
      by four men, who took him to the prison in the town, where Christophe
      immediately fell into the deep sleep which, they say, comes to most
      mothers after the terrible pangs of childbirth.

    <h2>
      IX. THE TUMULT AT AMBOISE
    </h2>
    <p>
      By moving the court to the chateau of Amboise, the two Lorrain princes
      intended to set a trap for the leader of the party of the Reformation, the
      Prince de Conde, whom they had made the king summon to his presence. As
      vassal of the Crown and prince of the blood, Conde was bound to obey the
      summons of his sovereign. Not to come to Amboise would constitute the
      crime of treason; but if he came, he put himself in the power of the
      Crown. Now, at this moment, as we have seen, the Crown, the council, the
      court, and all their powers were solely in the hands of the Duc de Guise
      and the Cardinal de Lorraine. The Prince de Conde showed, at this delicate
      crisis, a presence of mind and a decision and willingness which made him
      the worthy exponent of Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret and the valorous general of the
      Reformers. He travelled at the rear of the conspirators as far as Vendome,
      intending to support them in case of their success. When the first
      uprising ended by a brief skirmish, in which the flower of the nobility
      beguiled by Calvin perished, the prince arrived, with fifty noblemen, at
      the chateau of Amboise on the very day after that fight, which the politic
      Guises termed &ldquo;the Tumult of Amboise.&rdquo; As soon as the duke and cardinal
      heard of his coming they sent the Marechal de Saint-Andre with an escort
      of a hundred men to meet him. When the prince and his own escort reached
      the gates of the chateau the marechal refused entrance to the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must enter alone, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the Chancellor Olivier, the
      Cardinal de Tournon, and Birago, who were stationed outside of the
      portcullis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are suspected of treason,&rdquo; replied the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, who saw that his suite were already surrounded by the troop of
      the Duc de Nemours, replied tranquilly: &ldquo;If that is so, I will go alone to
      my cousin, and prove to him my innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted, talked with perfect freedom of mind to Birago, the Cardinal
      de Tournon, the chancellor, and the Duc de Nemours, from whom he asked for
      particulars of the &ldquo;tumult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied the duke, &ldquo;the rebels had confederates in Amboise.
      A captain, named Lanoue, had introduced armed men, who opened the gate to
      them, through which they entered and made themselves masters of the town&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, you opened the mouth of a sack, and they ran into it,&rdquo;
       replied the prince, looking at Birago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they had been supported by the attack which Captain Chaudieu, the
      preacher&rsquo;s brother, was expected to make before the gate of the
      Bon-Hommes, they would have been completely successful,&rdquo; replied the Duc
      de Nemours. &ldquo;But in consequence of the position which the Duc de Guise
      ordered me to take up, Captain Chaudieu was obliged to turn my flank to
      avoid a fight. So instead of arriving by night, like the rest, this rebel
      and his men got there at daybreak, by which time the king&rsquo;s troops had
      crushed the invaders of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had a reserve force to recover the gate which had been opened to
      them?&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marechal de Saint-Andre was there with five hundred
      men-at-arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince gave the highest praise to these military arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lieutenant-general must have been fully aware of the plans of the
      Reformers, to have acted as he did,&rdquo; he said in conclusion. &ldquo;They were no
      doubt betrayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was treated with increasing harshness. After separating him
      from his escort at the gates, the cardinal and the chancellor barred his
      way when he reached the staircase which led to the apartments of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are directed by his Majesty, monseigneur, to take you to your own
      apartments,&rdquo; they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, then, a prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that were the king&rsquo;s intention you would not be accompanied by a
      prince of the Church, nor by me,&rdquo; replied the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two personages escorted the prince to an apartment, where guards of
      honor&mdash;so-called&mdash;were given him. There he remained, without
      seeing any one, for some hours. From his window he looked down upon the
      Loire and the meadows of the beautiful valley stretching from Amboise to
      Tours. He was reflecting on the situation, and asking himself whether the
      Guises would really dare anything against his person, when the door of his
      chamber opened and Chicot, the king&rsquo;s fool, formerly a dependent of his
      own, entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me you were in disgrace,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never believe how virtuous the court has become since the death of
      Henri II.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king loves a laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which king,&mdash;Francois II., or Francois de Lorraine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not afraid of the duke, if you talk in that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t punish me for it, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Chicot, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what do I owe the honor of this visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Isn&rsquo;t it due to you on your return? I bring you my cap and bells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I go out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I do go out, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that you had won the game by playing against the rules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicot, you alarm me. Are you sent here by some one who takes an interest
      in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Chicot, nodding. He came nearer to the prince, and made him
      understand that they were being watched and overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say to me?&rdquo; asked the Prince de Conde, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boldness alone can pull you out of this scrape; the message comes from
      the queen-mother,&rdquo; replied the fool, slipping his words into the ear of
      the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell those who sent you,&rdquo; replied Conde, &ldquo;that I should not have entered
      this chateau if I had anything to reproach myself with, or to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rush to report that lofty answer!&rdquo; cried the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, that is, about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, before the
      king&rsquo;s dinner, the chancellor and Cardinal de Tournon came to fetch the
      prince and present him to Francois II. in the great gallery of the chateau
      of Amboise, where the councils were held. There, before the whole court,
      Conde pretended surprise at the coldness with which the little king
      received him, and asked the reason of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are accused, cousin,&rdquo; said the queen-mother, sternly, &ldquo;of taking part
      in the conspiracy of the Reformers; and you must prove yourself a faithful
      subject and a good Catholic, if you do not desire to draw down upon your
      house the anger of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words said, in the midst of the most profound silence, by
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, on whose right arm the king was leaning, the Duc
      d&rsquo;Orleans being on her left side, the Prince de Conde recoiled three
      steps, laid his hand on his sword with a proud motion, and looked at all
      the persons who surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who said that, madame,&rdquo; he cried in an angry voice, &ldquo;lied in their
      throats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he flung his glove at the king&rsquo;s feet, saying: &ldquo;Let him who believes
      that calumny come forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole court trembled as the Duc de Guise was seen to leave his place;
      but instead of picking up the glove, he advanced to the intrepid
      hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you desire a second in that duel, monseigneur, do me the honor to
      accept my services,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will answer for you; I know that you will
      show the Reformers how mistaken they are if they think to have you for
      their leader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was forced to take the hand of the lieutenant-general of the
      kingdom. Chicot picked up the glove and returned it to Monsieur de Conde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said the little king, &ldquo;you must draw your sword only for the
      defence of the kingdom. Come and dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal de Lorraine, surprised at his brother&rsquo;s action, drew him away
      to his own apartments. The Prince de Conde, having escaped his apparent
      danger, offered his hand to Mary Stuart to lead her to the dining hall;
      but all the while that he made her flattering speeches he pondered in his
      mind what trap the astute Balafre was setting for him. In vain he worked
      his brains, for it was not until Queen Mary herself betrayed it that he
      guessed the intention of the Guises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twould have been a great pity,&rdquo; she said laughing, &ldquo;if so clever a head
      had fallen; you must admit that my uncle has been generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; for my head is only useful on my shoulders, though one of
      them is notoriously higher than the other. But is this really your uncle&rsquo;s
      generosity? Is he not getting the credit of it rather cheaply? Do you
      think it would be so easy to take off the head of a prince of the blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is not over yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shall see what your conduct will be
      at the execution of the noblemen, your friends, at which the Council has
      decided to make a great public display of severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;whatever the king does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, the queen-mother, and myself will be present at the execution,
      together with the whole court and the ambassadors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fete!&rdquo; said the prince, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that,&rdquo; said the young queen, &ldquo;an <i>act of faith</i>, an act
      of the highest policy. &lsquo;Tis a question of forcing the noblemen of France
      to submit themselves to the Crown, and compelling them to give up their
      tastes for plots and factions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not break their belligerent tempers by the show of danger,
      madame; you will risk the Crown itself in the attempt,&rdquo; replied the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the dinner, which was gloomy enough, Queen Mary had the
      cruel boldness to turn the conversation openly upon the trial of the
      noblemen on the charge of being seized with arms in their hands, and to
      speak of the necessity of making a great public show of their execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Francois II., &ldquo;is it not enough for the king of France to
      know that so much brave blood is to flow? Must he make a triumph of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire; but an example,&rdquo; replied Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the custom of your father and your grandfather to be present at
      the burning of heretics,&rdquo; said Mary Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kings who reigned before me did as they thought best, and I choose to
      do as I please,&rdquo; said the little king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip the Second,&rdquo; remarked Catherine, &ldquo;who is certainly a great king,
      lately postponed an <i>auto da fe</i> until he could return from the Low
      Countries to Valladolid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, cousin?&rdquo; said the king to Prince de Conde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you cannot avoid it, and the papal nuncio and all the ambassadors
      should be present. I shall go willingly, as these ladies take part in the
      fete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Prince de Conde, at a glance from Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, bravely
      chose his course.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At the moment when the Prince de Conde was entering the chateau d&rsquo;Amboise,
      Lecamus, the furrier of the two queens, was also arriving from Paris,
      brought to Amboise by the anxiety into which the news of the tumult had
      thrown both his family and that of Lallier. When the old man presented
      himself at the gate of the chateau, the captain of the guard, on hearing
      that he was the queens&rsquo; furrier, said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good man, if you want to be hanged you have only to set foot in this
      courtyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words, the father, in despair, sat down on a stone at a
      little distance and waited until some retainer of the two queens or some
      servant-woman might pass who would give him news of his son. But he sat
      there all day without seeing any one whom he knew, and was forced at last
      to go down into the town, where he found, not without some difficulty, a
      lodging in a hostelry on the public square where the executions took
      place. He was obliged to pay a pound a day to obtain a room with a window
      looking on the square. The next day he had the courage to watch, from his
      window, the execution of all the abettors of the rebellion who were
      condemned to be broken on the wheel or hanged, as persons of little
      importance. He was happy indeed not to see his own son among the victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the execution was over he went into the square and put himself in the
      way of the clerk of the court. After giving his name, and slipping a purse
      full of crowns into the man&rsquo;s hand, he begged him to look on the records
      and see if the name of Christophe Lecamus appeared in either of the three
      preceding executions. The clerk, touched by the manner and the tones of
      the despairing father, took him to his own house. After a careful search
      he was able to give the old man an absolute assurance that Christophe was
      not among the persons thus far executed, nor among those who were to be
      put to death within a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;Parliament has taken charge of the trial
      of the great lords implicated in the affair, and also that of the
      principal leaders. Perhaps your son is detained in the prisons of the
      chateau, and he may be brought forth for the magnificent execution which
      their Excellencies the Duc de Guise and the Cardinal de Lorraine are now
      preparing. The heads of twenty-seven barons, eleven counts, and seven
      marquises,&mdash;in all, fifty noblemen or leaders of the Reformers,&mdash;are
      to be cut off. As the justiciary of the county of Tourine is quite
      distinct from that of the parliament of Paris, if you are determined to
      know about your son, I advise you to go and see the Chancelier Olivier,
      who has the management of this great trial under orders from the
      lieutenant-general of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor old man, acting on this advice, went three times to see the
      chancellor, standing in a long queue of persons waiting to ask mercy for
      their friends. But as the titled men were made to pass before the
      burghers, he was obliged to give up the hope of speaking to the
      chancellor, though he saw him several times leave the house to go either
      to the chateau or to the committee appointed by the Parliament,&mdash;passing
      each time between a double hedge of petitioners who were kept back by the
      guards to allow him free passage. It was a horrible scene of anguish and
      desolation; for among these petitioners were many women, wives, mothers,
      daughters, whole families in distress. Old Lecamus gave much gold to the
      footmen of the chateau, entreating them to put certain letters which he
      wrote into the hand either of Dayelle, Queen Mary&rsquo;s woman, or into that of
      the queen-mother; but the footmen took the poor man&rsquo;s money and carried
      the letters, according to the general order of the cardinal, to the
      provost-marshal. By displaying such unheard-of cruelty the Guises knew
      that they incurred great dangers from revenge, and never did they take
      such precautions for their safety as they did while the court was at
      Amboise; consequently, neither the greatest of all corrupters, gold, nor
      the incessant and active search which the old furrier instituted gave him
      the slightest gleam of light on the fate of his son. He went about the
      little town with a mournful air, watching the great preparations made by
      order of the cardinal for the dreadful show at which the Prince de Conde
      had agreed to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public curiosity was stimulated from Paris to Nantes by the means adopted
      on this occasion. The execution was announced from all pulpits by the
      rectors of the churches, while at the same time they gave thanks for the
      victory of the king over the heretics. Three handsome balconies, the
      middle one more sumptuous than the other two, were built against the
      terrace of the chateau of Amboise, at the foot of which the executions
      were appointed to take place. Around the open square, stagings were
      erected, and these were filled with an immense crowd of people attracted
      by the wide-spread notoriety given to this &ldquo;act of faith.&rdquo; Ten thousand
      persons camped in the adjoining fields the night before the day on which
      the horrible spectacle was appointed to take place. The roofs on the
      houses were crowded with spectators, and windows were let at ten pounds
      apiece,&mdash;an enormous sum in those days. The poor old father had
      engaged, as we may well believe, one of the best places from which the eye
      could take in the whole of the terrible scene, where so many men of noble
      blood were to perish on a vast scaffold covered with black cloth, erected
      in the middle of the open square. Thither, on the morning of the fatal
      day, they brought the <i>chouquet</i>,&mdash;a name given to the block on
      which the condemned man laid his head as he knelt before it. After this
      they brought an arm-chair draped with black, for the clerk of the
      Parliament, whose business it was to call up the condemned noblemen to
      their death and read their sentences. The whole square was guarded from
      early morning by the Scottish guard and the gendarmes of the king&rsquo;s
      household, in order to keep back the crowd which threatened to fill it
      before the hour of the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a solemn mass said at the chateau and in the churches of the town,
      the condemned lords, the last of the conspirators who were left alive,
      were led out. These gentlemen, some of whom had been put to the torture,
      were grouped at the foot of the scaffold and surrounded by monks, who
      endeavored to make them abjure the doctrines of Calvin. But not a single
      man listened to the words of the priests who had been appointed for this
      duty by the Cardinal of Lorraine; among whom the gentlemen no doubt feared
      to find spies of the Guises. In order to avoid the importunity of these
      antagonists they chanted a psalm, put into French verse by Clement Marot.
      Calvin, as we all know, had ordained that prayers to God should be in the
      language of each country, as much from a principle of common sense as in
      opposition to the Roman worship. To those in the crowd who pitied these
      unfortunate gentlemen it was a moving incident to hear them chant the
      following verse at the very moment when the king and court arrived and
      took their places:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;God be merciful unto us,
    And bless us!
  And show us the light of his countenance,
    And be merciful unto us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The eyes of all the Reformers turned to their leader, the Prince de Conde,
      who was placed intentionally between Queen Mary and the young Duc
      d&rsquo;Orleans. Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was beside the king, and the rest of the
      court were on her left. The papal nuncio stood behind Queen Mary; the
      lieutenant-general of the kingdom, the Duc de Guise, was on horseback
      below the balcony, with two of the marshals of France and his staff
      captains. When the Prince de Conde appeared all the condemned noblemen who
      knew him bowed to him, and the brave hunchback returned their salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hard,&rdquo; he remarked to the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans, &ldquo;not to be civil to
      those about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two other balconies were filled by invited guests, courtiers, and
      persons on duty about the court. In short, the whole company of the
      chateau de Blois had come to Amboise to assist at this festival of death,
      precisely as it passed, a little later, from the pleasures of a court to
      the perils of war, with an easy facility, which will always seem to
      foreigners one of the main supports of their policy toward France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor syndic of the furriers of Paris was filled with the keenest joy
      at not seeing his son among the fifty-seven gentlemen who were condemned
      to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from the Duc de Guise, the clerk seated on the scaffold cried in
      a loud voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean-Louis-Alberic, Baron de Raunay, guilty of heresy, of the crime of <i>lese-majeste</i>,
      and assault with armed hand against the person of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall handsome man mounted the scaffold with a firm step, bowed to the
      people and the court, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sentence lies. I took arms to deliver the king from his enemies, the
      Guises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed his head on the block, and it fell. The Reformers chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou, O God! hast proved us;
    Thou hast tried us;
  As silver is tried in the fire,
    So hast thou purified us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert-Jean-Rene Briquemart, Comte de Villemongis, guilty of the crime of
      <i>lese-majeste</i>, and of attempts against the person of the king!&rdquo;
       called the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count dipped his hands in the blood of the Baron de Raunay, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May this blood recoil upon those who are really guilty of those crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reformers chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou broughtest us into the snare;
    Thou laidest afflictions upon our loins;
  Thou hast suffered our enemies
    To ride over us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit, monseigneur,&rdquo; said the Prince de Conde to the papal
      nuncio, &ldquo;that if these French gentlemen know how to conspire, they also
      know how to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hatreds, brother!&rdquo; whispered the Duchesse de Guise to the Cardinal
      de Lorraine, &ldquo;you are drawing down upon the heads of our children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sight makes me sick,&rdquo; said the young king, turning pale at the flow
      of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! only rebels!&rdquo; replied Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chants went on; the axe still fell. The sublime spectacle of men
      singing as they died, and, above all, the impression produced upon the
      crowd by the progressive diminution of the chanting voices, superseded the
      fear inspired by the Guises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried the people with one voice, when they heard the solitary
      chant of the last and most important of the great lords, who was saved to
      be the final victim. He alone remained at the foot of the steps by which
      the others had mounted the scaffold, and he chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou, O God, be merciful unto us,
    And bless us,
  And cause thy face to shine upon us.
    Amen!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Duc de Nemours,&rdquo; said the Prince de Conde, weary of the part he was
      playing; &ldquo;you who have the credit of the skirmish, and who helped to make
      these men prisoners, do you not feel under an obligation to ask mercy for
      this one? It is Castelnau, who, they say, received your word of honor that
      he should be courteously treated if he surrendered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I waited till he was here before trying to save him?&rdquo; said
      the Duc de Nemours, stung by the stern reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk called slowly&mdash;no doubt he was intentionally slow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michel-Jean-Louis, Baron de Castelnau-Chalosse, accused and convicted of
      the crime of <i>lese-majeste</i>, and of attempts against the person of
      the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Castelnau, proudly, &ldquo;it cannot be a crime to oppose the tyranny
      and the projected usurpation of the Guises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The executioner, sick of his task, saw a movement in the king&rsquo;s gallery,
      and fumbled with his axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le baron,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not want to execute you; a moment&rsquo;s
      delay may save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the people again cried, &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;mercy for that poor Castelnau, who saved the life
      of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal intentionally misunderstood the king&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he motioned to the executioner, and the head of Castelnau fell at
      the very moment when the king had pronounced his pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That head, cardinal, goes to your account,&rdquo; said Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after this dreadful execution the Prince de Conde returned to
      Navarre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair produced a great sensation in France and at all the foreign
      courts. The torrents of noble blood then shed caused such anguish to the
      chancellor Olivier that his honorable mind, perceiving at last the real
      end and aim of the Guises disguised under a pretext of defending religion
      and the monarchy, felt itself no longer able to make head against them.
      Though he was their creature, he was not willing to sacrifice his duty and
      the Throne to their ambition; and he withdrew from his post, suggesting
      l&rsquo;Hopital as his rightful successor. Catherine, hearing of Olivier&rsquo;s
      suggestion, immediately proposed Birago, and put much warmth into her
      request. The cardinal, knowing nothing of the letter written by l&rsquo;Hopital
      to the queen-mother, and supposing him faithful to the house of Lorraine,
      pressed his appointment in opposition to that of Birago, and Catherine
      allowed herself to seem vanquished. From the moment that l&rsquo;Hopital entered
      upon his duties he took measures against the Inquisition, which the
      Cardinal de Lorraine was desirous of introducing into France; and he
      thwarted so successfully all the anti-gallican policy of the Guises, and
      proved himself so true a Frenchmen, that in order to subdue him he was
      exiled, within three months of his appointment, to his country-seat of
      Vignay, near Etampes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy old Lecamus waited impatiently till the court left Amboise,
      being unable to find an opportunity to speak to either of the queens, and
      hoping to put himself in their way as the court advanced along the
      river-bank on its return to Blois. He disguised himself as a pauper, at
      the risk of being taken for a spy, and by means of this travesty, he
      mingled with the crowd of beggars which lined the roadway. After the
      departure of the Prince de Conde, and the execution of the leaders, the
      duke and cardinal thought they had sufficiently silenced the Reformers to
      allow the queen-mother a little more freedom. Lecamus knew that, instead
      of travelling in a litter, Catherine intended to go on horseback, <i>a la
      planchette</i>,&mdash;such was the name given to a sort of stirrup
      invented for or by the queen-mother, who, having hurt her leg on some
      occasion, ordered a velvet-covered saddle with a plank on which she could
      place both feet by sitting sideways on the horse and passing one leg
      through a depression in the saddle. As the queen-mother had very handsome
      legs, she was accused of inventing this method of riding, in order to show
      them. The old furrier fortunately found a moment when he could present
      himself to her sight; but the instant that the queen recognized him she
      gave signs of displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, my good man, and let no one see you speak to me,&rdquo; she said with
      anxiety. &ldquo;Get yourself elected deputy to the States-general, by the guild
      of your trade, and act for me when the Assembly convenes at Orleans; you
      shall know whom to trust in the matter of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he living?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus was obliged to return to Paris with nothing better than those
      doubtful words and the secret of the approaching convocation of the
      States-general, thus confided to him by the queen-mother.

    <h2>
      X. COSMO RUGGIERO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Cardinal de Lorraine obtained, within a few days of the events just
      related, certain revelations as to the culpability of the court of
      Navarre. At Lyon, and at Mouvans in Dauphine, a body of Reformers, under
      command of the most enterprising prince of the house of Bourbon had
      endeavored to incite the populace to rise. Such audacity, after the bloody
      executions at Amboise, astonished the Guises, who (no doubt to put an end
      to heresy by means known only to themselves) proposed the convocation of
      the States-general at Orleans. Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, seeing a chance of
      support to her policy in a national representation, joyfully agreed to it.
      The cardinal, bent on recovering his prey and degrading the house of
      Bourbon, convoked the States for the sole purpose of bringing the Prince
      de Conde and the king of Navarre (Antoine de Bourbon, father of Henri IV.)
      to Orleans,&mdash;intending to make use of Christophe to convict the
      prince of high treason if he succeeded in again getting him within the
      power of the Crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two months had passed in the prison at Blois, Christophe was removed
      on a litter to a tow-boat, which sailed up the Loire to Orleans, helped by
      a westerly wind. He arrived there in the evening and was taken at once to
      the celebrated tower of Saint-Aignan. The poor lad, who did not know what
      to think of his removal, had plenty of time to reflect on his conduct and
      on his future. He remained there two months, lying on his pallet, unable
      to move his legs. The bones of his joints were broken. When he asked for
      the help of a surgeon of the town, the jailer replied that the orders were
      so strict about him that he dared not allow any one but himself even to
      bring him food. This severity, which placed him virtually in solitary
      confinement, amazed Christophe. To his mind, he ought either to be hanged
      or released; for he was, of course, entirely ignorant of the events at
      Amboise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of certain secret advice sent to them by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici,
      the two chiefs of the house of Bourbon resolved to be present at the
      States-general, so completely did the autograph letters they received from
      the king reassure them; and no sooner had the court established itself at
      Orleans than it learned, not without amazement, from Groslot, chancellor
      of Navarre, that the Bourbon princes had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois II. established himself in the house of the chancellor of
      Navarre, who was also <i>bailli</i>, in other words, chief justice of the
      law courts, at Orleans. This Groslot, whose dual position was one of the
      singularities of this period&mdash;when Reformers themselves owned abbeys&mdash;Groslot,
      the Jacques Coeur of Orleans, one of the richest burghers of the day, did
      not bequeath his name to the house, for in after years it was called Le
      Bailliage, having been, undoubtedly, purchased either by the heirs of the
      Crown or by the provinces as the proper place in which to hold the legal
      courts. This charming structure, built by the bourgeoisie of the sixteenth
      century, which completes so admirably the history of a period in which
      king, nobles, and burghers rivalled each other in the grace, elegance, and
      richness of their dwellings (witness Varangeville, the splendid
      manor-house of Ango, and the mansion, called that of Hercules, in Paris),
      exists to this day, though in a state to fill archaeologists and lovers of
      the Middle Ages with despair. It would be difficult, however, to go to
      Orleans and not take notice of the Hotel-de-Ville which stands on the
      place de l&rsquo;Estape. This hotel-de-ville, or town-hall, is the former
      Bailliage, the mansion of Groslot, the most illustrious house in Orleans,
      and the most neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remains of this old building will still show, to the eyes of an
      archaeologist, how magnificent it was at a period when the houses of the
      burghers were commonly built of wood rather than stone, a period when
      noblemen alone had the right to build <i>manors</i>,&mdash;a significant
      word. Having served as the dwelling of the king at a period when the court
      displayed much pomp and luxury, the hotel Groslot must have been the most
      splendid house in Orleans. It was here, on the place de l&rsquo;Estape, that the
      Guises and the king reviewed the burgher guard, of which Monsieur de
      Cypierre was made the commander during the sojourn of the king. At this
      period the cathedral of Sainte-Croix, afterward completed by Henri IV.,&mdash;who
      chose to give that proof of the sincerity of his conversion,&mdash;was in
      process of erection, and its neighborhood, heaped with stones and cumbered
      with piles of wood, was occupied by the Guises and their retainers, who
      were quartered in the bishop&rsquo;s palace, now destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was under military discipline, and the measures taken by the
      Guises proved how little liberty they intended to leave to the
      States-general, the members of which flocked into the town, raising the
      rents of the poorest lodgings. The court, the burgher militia, the
      nobility, and the burghers themselves were all in a state of expectation,
      awaiting some <i>coup-d&rsquo;Etat</i>; and they found themselves not mistaken
      when the princes of the blood arrived. As the Bourbon princes entered the
      king&rsquo;s chamber, the court saw with terror the insolent bearing of Cardinal
      de Lorraine. Determined to show his intentions openly, he remained
      covered, while the king of Navarre stood before him bare-headed. Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici lowered her eyes, not to show the indignation that she felt.
      Then followed a solemn explanation between the young king and the two
      chiefs of the younger branch. It was short, for that the first words of
      the Prince de Conde Francois II. interrupted him, with threatening looks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, my cousins, I had supposed the affair of Amboise over; I find
      it is not so, and you are compelling us to regret the indulgence which we
      showed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the king so much as the Messieurs de Guise who now address us,&rdquo;
       replied the Prince de Conde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur,&rdquo; cried the little king, crimson with anger. When he left
      the king&rsquo;s presence the prince found his way barred in the great hall by
      two officers of the Scottish guard. As the captain of the French guard
      advanced, the prince drew a letter from his doublet, and said to him in
      presence of the whole court:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you read that paper aloud to me, Monsieur de Maille-Breze?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said the French captain:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;My cousin, come in all security; I give you my royal word that
  you can do so. If you have need of a safe conduct, this letter
  will serve as one.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed?&rdquo; said the shrewd and courageous hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signed &lsquo;Francois,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Maille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, &ldquo;it is signed: &lsquo;Your good cousin and
      friend, Francois,&rsquo;&mdash;Messieurs,&rdquo; he said to the Scotch guard, &ldquo;I
      follow you to the prison to which you are ordered, on behalf of the king,
      to conduct me. There is enough nobility in this hall to understand the
      matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The profound silence which followed these words ought to have enlightened
      the Guises, but silence is that to which all princes listen least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the Cardinal de Tournon, who was following the prince,
      &ldquo;you know well that since the affair at Amboise you have made certain
      attempts both at Lyon and at Mouvans in Dauphine against the royal
      authority, of which the king had no knowledge when he wrote to you in
      those terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tricksters!&rdquo; cried the prince, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a public declaration against the Mass and in favor of
      heresy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are masters in Navarre,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say in Bearn. But you owe homage to the Crown,&rdquo; replied
      President de Thou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you here, president?&rdquo; cried the prince, sarcastically. &ldquo;Is the whole
      Parliament with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he cast a look of contempt upon the cardinal and left the hall.
      He saw plainly enough that they meant to have his head. The next day, when
      Messieurs de Thou, de Viole, d&rsquo;Espesse, the procureur-general Bourdin, and
      the chief clerk of the court du Tillet, entered his presence, he kept them
      standing, and expressed his regrets to see them charged with a duty which
      did not belong to them. Then he said to the clerk, &ldquo;Write down what I
      say,&rdquo; and dictated as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I, Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conde, peer of the kingdom,
  Marquis de Conti, Comte de Soissons, prince of the blood of
  France, do declare that I formally refuse to recognize any
  commission appointed to try me, because, in my quality and in
  virtue of the privilege appertaining to all members of the royal
  house, I can only be accused, tried, and judged by the Parliament
  of peers, both Chambers assembled, the king being seated on his
  bed of justice.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know that, gentlemen, better than others,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;and
      this reply is all that you will get from me. For the rest, I trust in God
      and my right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magistrates continued to address him notwithstanding his obstinate
      silence. The king of Navarre was left at liberty, but closely watched; his
      prison was larger than that of the prince, and this was the only real
      difference in the position of the two brothers,&mdash;the intention being
      that their heads should fall together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe was therefore kept in the strictest solitary confinement by
      order of the cardinal and the lieutenant-general of the kingdom, for no
      other purpose than to give the judges proof of the culpability of the
      Prince de Conde. The letters seized on Lasagne, the prince&rsquo;s secretary,
      though intelligible to statesmen, where not sufficiently plain proof for
      judges. The cardinal intended to confront the prince and Christophe by
      accident; and it was not without intention that the young Reformer was
      placed in one of the lower rooms in the tower of Saint-Aignan, with a
      window looking on the prison yard. Each time that Christophe was brought
      before the magistrates, and subjected to a close examination, he sheltered
      himself behind a total and complete denial, which prolonged his trial
      until after the opening of the States-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lecamus, who by that time had got himself elected deputy of the <i>tiers-etat</i>
      by the burghers of Paris, arrived at Orleans a few days after the arrest
      of the Prince de Conde. This news, which reached him at Etampes, redoubled
      his anxiety; for he fully understood&mdash;he, who alone knew of
      Christophe&rsquo;s interview with the prince under the bridge near his own house&mdash;that
      his son&rsquo;s fate was closely bound up with that of the leader of the
      Reformed party. He therefore determined to study the dark tangle of
      interests which were struggling together at court in order to discover
      some means of rescuing his son. It was useless to think of Queen
      Catherine, who refused to see her furrier. No one about the court whom he
      was able to address could give him any satisfactory information about
      Christophe; and he fell at last into a state of such utter despair that he
      was on the verge of appealing to the cardinal himself, when he learned
      that Monsieur de Thou (and this was the great stain upon that good man&rsquo;s
      life) had consented to be one of the judges of the Prince de Conde. The
      old furrier went at once to see him, and learned at last that Christophe
      was still living, though a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourillon, the glover (to whom La Renaudie sent Christophe on his way to
      Blois), had offered a room in his house to the Sieur Lecamus for the whole
      time of his stay in Orleans during the sittings of the States-general. The
      glover believed the furrier to be, like himself, secretly attached to the
      Reformed religion; but he soon saw that a father who fears for the life of
      his child pays no heed to shades of religious opinion, but flings himself
      prone upon the bosom of God without caring what insignia men give to Him.
      The poor old man, repulsed in all his efforts, wandered like one
      bewildered through the streets. Contrary to his expectations, his money
      availed him nothing; Monsieur de Thou had warned him that if he bribed any
      servant of the house of Guise he would merely lose his money, for the duke
      and cardinal allowed nothing that related to Christophe to transpire. De
      Thou, whose fame is somewhat tarnished by the part he played at this
      crisis, endeavored to give some hope to the poor father; but he trembled
      so much himself for the fate of his godson that his attempts at
      consolation only alarmed the old man still more. Lecamus roamed the
      streets; in three months he had shrunk visibly. His only hope now lay in
      the warm friendship which for so many years had bound him to the
      Hippocrates of the sixteenth century. Ambroise Pare tried to say a word to
      Queen Mary on leaving the chamber of the king, who was then indisposed;
      but no sooner had he named Christophe than the daughter of the Stuarts,
      nervous at the prospect of her fate should any evil happen to the king,
      and believing that the Reformers were attempting to poison him, cried out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my uncles had only listened to me, that fanatic would have been hanged
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening on which this fatal answer was repeated to old Lecamus, by his
      friend Pare on the place de l&rsquo;Estape, he returned home half dead to his
      own chamber, refusing to eat any supper. Tourillon, uneasy about him, went
      up to his room and found him in tears; the aged eyes showed the inflamed
      red lining of their lids, so that the glover fancied for a moment that he
      was weeping tears of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comfort yourself, father,&rdquo; said the Reformer; &ldquo;the burghers of Orleans
      are furious to see their city treated as though it were taken by assault,
      and guarded by the soldiers of Monsieur de Cypierre. If the life of the
      Prince de Conde is in any real danger we will soon demolish the tower of
      Saint-Aignan; the whole town is on the side of the Reformers, and it will
      rise in rebellion; you may be sure of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, even if they hang the Guises, it will not give me back my son,&rdquo; said
      the wretched father.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant some one rapped cautiously on Tourillon&rsquo;s outer door, and
      the glover went downstairs to open it himself. The night was dark. In
      these troublous times the masters of all households took minute
      precautions. Tourillon looked through the peep-holes cut in the door, and
      saw a stranger, whose accent indicated an Italian. The man, who was
      dressed in black, asked to speak with Lecamus on matters of business, and
      Tourillon admitted him. When the furrier caught sight of his visitor he
      shuddered violently; but the stranger managed, unseen by Tourillon, to lay
      his fingers on his lips. Lecamus, understanding the gesture, said
      immediately:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come, I suppose, to offer furs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Si</i>,&rdquo; said the Italian, discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This personage was no other than the famous Ruggiero, astrologer to the
      queen-mother. Tourillon went below to his own apartment, feeling convinced
      that he was one too many in that of his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we talk without danger of being overheard?&rdquo; said the cautious
      Florentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to be in the open fields for that,&rdquo; replied Lecamus. &ldquo;But we are
      not allowed to leave the town; you know the severity with which the gates
      are guarded. No one can leave Orleans without a pass from Monsieur de
      Cypierre,&rdquo; he added,&mdash;&ldquo;not even I, who am a member of the
      States-general. Complaint is to be made at to-morrow&rsquo;s session of this
      restriction of liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work like a mole, but don&rsquo;t let your paws be seen in anything, no matter
      what,&rdquo; said the wary Italian. &ldquo;To-morrow will, no doubt, prove a decisive
      day. Judging by my observations, you may, perhaps, recover your son
      to-morrow, or the day after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God hear you&mdash;you who are thought to traffic with the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my place,&rdquo; said the astrologer, smiling. &ldquo;I live in the tower of
      Sieur Touchet de Beauvais, the lieutenant of the Bailliage, whose daughter
      the little Duc d&rsquo;Orleans has taken such a fancy to; it is there that I
      observe the planets. I have drawn the girl&rsquo;s horoscope, and it says that
      she will become a great lady and be beloved by a king. The lieutenant, her
      father, is a clever man; he loves science, and the queen sent me to lodge
      with him. He has had the sense to be a rabid Guisist while awaiting the
      reign of Charles IX.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The furrier and the astrologer reached the house of the Sieur de Beauvais
      without being met or even seen; but, in case Lecamus&rsquo; visit should be
      discovered, the Florentine intended to give a pretext of an astrological
      consultation on his son&rsquo;s fate. When they were safely at the top of the
      tower, where the astrologer did his work, Lecamus said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my son really living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he still lives,&rdquo; replied Ruggiero; &ldquo;and the question now is how to
      save him. Remember this, seller of skins, I would not give two farthings
      for yours if ever in all your life a single syllable should escape you of
      what I am about to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a useless caution, my friend; I have been furrier to the court
      since the time of the late Louis XII.; this is the fourth reign that I
      have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you may soon see the fifth,&rdquo; remarked Ruggiero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been put to the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; said the old man, raising his eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His knees and ankles were a bit injured, but he has won a royal
      protection which will extend over his whole life,&rdquo; said the Florentine
      hastily, seeing the terror of the poor father. &ldquo;Your little Christophe has
      done a service to our great queen, Catherine. If we manage to pull him out
      of the claws of the Guises you will see him some day councillor to the
      Parliament. Any man would gladly have his bones cracked three times over
      to stand so high in the good graces of this dear sovereign,&mdash;a grand
      and noble genius, who will triumph in the end over all obstacles. I have
      drawn the horoscope of the Duc de Guise; he will be killed within a year.
      Well, so Christophe saw the Prince de Conde&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You who read the future ought to know the past,&rdquo; said the furrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good man, I am not questioning you, I am telling you a fact. Now, if
      your son, who will to-morrow be placed in the prince&rsquo;s way as he passes,
      should recognize him, or if the prince should recognize your son, the head
      of Monsieur de Conde will fall. God knows what will become of his
      accomplice! However, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Neither your son nor the prince
      will die; I have drawn their horoscope,&mdash;they will live; but I do not
      know in what way they will get out of this affair. Without distrusting the
      certainty of my calculations, we must do something to bring about results.
      To-morrow the prince will receive, from sure hands, a prayer-book in which
      we convey the information to him. God grant that your son be cautious, for
      him we cannot warn. A single glance of recognition will cost the prince&rsquo;s
      life. Therefore, although the queen-mother has every reason to trust in
      Christophe&rsquo;s faithfulness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put it to a cruel test!&rdquo; cried the furrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so! Do you think the queen-mother is on a bed of roses? She
      is taking measures as if the Guises had already decided on the death of
      the prince, and right she is, the wise and prudent queen! Now listen to
      me; she counts on you to help her in all things. You have some influence
      with the <i>tiers-etat</i>, where you represent the body of the guilds of
      Paris, and though the Guisards may promise you to set your son at liberty,
      try to fool them and maintain the independence of the guilds. Demand the
      queen-mother as regent; the king of Navarre will publicly accept the
      proposal at the session of the States-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will die,&rdquo; replied Ruggiero; &ldquo;I have read his horoscope. What
      the queen-mother requires you to do for her at the States-general is a
      very simple thing; but there is a far greater service which she asks of
      you. You helped Ambroise Pare in his studies, you are his friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambroise now loves the Duc de Guise more than he loves me; and he is
      right, for he owes his place to him. Besides, he is faithful to the king.
      Though he inclines to the Reformed religion, he will never do anything
      against his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse these honest men!&rdquo; cried the Florentine. &ldquo;Ambroise boasted this
      evening that he could bring the little king safely through his present
      illness (for he is really ill). If the king recovers his health, the
      Guises triumph, the princes die, the house of Bourbon becomes extinct, we
      shall return to Florence, your son will be hanged, and the Lorrains will
      easily get the better of the other sons of France&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry out in that way,&mdash;it is like a burgher who knows nothing
      of the court,&mdash;but go at once to Ambroise and find out from him what
      he intends to do to save the king&rsquo;s life. If there is anything decided on,
      come back to me at once, and tell me the treatment in which he has such
      faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Lecamus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey blindly, my dear friend; otherwise you will get your mind
      bewildered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; thought the furrier. &ldquo;I had better not know more&rdquo;; and he
      went at once in search of the king&rsquo;s surgeon, who lived at a hostelry in
      the place du Martroi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was at this moment in a political extremity very much
      like that in which poor Christophe had seen her at Blois. Though she had
      been in a way trained by the struggle, though she had exercised her lofty
      intellect by the lessons of that first defeat, her present situation,
      while nearly the same, had become more critical, more perilous than it was
      at Amboise. Events, like the woman herself, had magnified. Though she
      seemed to be in full accordance with the Guises, Catherine held in her
      hand the threads of a wisely planned conspiracy against her terrible
      associates, and was only awaiting a propitious moment to throw off the
      mask. The cardinal had just obtained the positive certainty that Catherine
      was deceiving him. Her subtle Italian spirit felt that the Younger branch
      was the best hindrance she could offer to the ambition of the duke and the
      cardinal; and (in spite of the advice of the two Gondis, who urged her to
      let the Guises wreak their vengeance on the Bourbons) she defeated the
      scheme concocted by them with Spain to seize the province of Bearn, by
      warning Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, queen of Navarre, of that threatened danger. As
      this state secret was known only to them and to the queen-mother, the
      Guises knew of course who had betrayed it, and resolved to send her back
      to Florence. But in order to make themselves perfectly sure of what they
      called her treason against the State (the State being the house of
      Lorraine), the duke and cardinal confided to her their intention of
      getting rid of the king of Navarre. The precautions instantly taken by
      Antoine proved conclusively to the two brothers that the secrets known
      only to them and the queen-mother had been divulged by the latter. The
      cardinal instantly taxed her with treachery, in presence of Francois II.,&mdash;threatening
      her with an edict of banishment in case of future indiscretion, which
      might, as they said, put the kingdom in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, who then felt herself in the utmost peril, acted in the spirit
      of a great king, giving proof of her high capacity. It must be added,
      however, that she was ably seconded by her friends. L&rsquo;Hopital managed to
      send her a note, written in the following terms:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Do not allow a prince of the blood to be put to death by a
  committee; or you will yourself be carried off in some way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Catherine sent Birago to Vignay to tell the chancellor (l&rsquo;Hopital) to come
      to Orleans at once, in spite of his being in disgrace. Birago returned the
      very night of which we are writing, and was now a few miles from Orleans
      with l&rsquo;Hopital, who heartily avowed himself for the queen-mother.
      Chiverni, whose fidelity was very justly suspected by the Guises, had
      escaped from Orleans and reached Ecouen in ten hours, by a forced march
      which almost cost him his life. There he told the Connetable de
      Montmorency of the peril of his nephew, the Prince de Conde, and the
      audacious hopes of the Guises. The Connetable, furious at the thought that
      the prince&rsquo;s life hung upon that of Francois II., started for Orleans at
      once with a hundred noblemen and fifteen hundred cavalry. In order to take
      the Messieurs de Guise by surprise he avoided Paris, and came direct from
      Ecouen to Corbeil, and from Corbeil to Pithiviers by the valley of the
      Essonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soldier against soldier, we must leave no chances,&rdquo; he said on the
      occasion of this bold march.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne de Montmorency, who had saved France at the time of the invasion of
      Provence by Charles V., and the Duc de Guise, who had stopped the second
      invasion by the emperor at Metz, were, in truth, the two great warriors of
      France at this period. Catherine had awaited this precise moment to rouse
      the inextinguishable hatred of the Connetable, whose disgrace and
      banishment were the work of the Guises. The Marquis de Simeuse, however,
      who commanded at Gien, being made aware of the large force approaching
      under command of the Connetable, jumped on his horse hoping to reach
      Orleans in time to warn the duke and cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure that the Connetable would come to the rescue of his nephew, and full
      of confidence in the Chancelier l&rsquo;Hopital&rsquo;s devotion to the royal cause,
      the queen-mother revived the hopes and the boldness of the Reformed party.
      The Colignys and the friends of the house of Bourbon, aware of their
      danger, now made common cause with the adherents of the queen-mother. A
      coalition between these opposing interests, attacked by a common enemy,
      formed itself silently in the States-general, where it soon became a
      question of appointing Catherine as regent in case the king should die.
      Catherine, whose faith in astrology was much greater than her faith in the
      Church, now dared all against her oppressors, seeing that her son was ill
      and apparently dying at the expiration of the time assigned to his life by
      the famous sorceress, whom Nostradamus had brought to her at the chateau
      of Chaumont.

    <h2>
      XI. AMBROISE PARE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days before the terrible end of the reign of Francois II., the king
      insisted on sailing down the Loire, wishing not to be in the town of
      Orleans on the day when the Prince de Conde was executed. Having yielded
      the head of the prince to the Cardinal de Lorraine, he was equally in
      dread of a rebellion among the townspeople and of the prayers and
      supplications of the Princesse de Conde. At the moment of embarkation, one
      of the cold winds which sweep along the Loire at the beginning of winter
      gave him so sharp an ear-ache that he was obliged to return to his
      apartments; there he took to his bed, not leaving it again until he died.
      In contradiction of the doctors, who, with the exception of Chapelain,
      were his enemies, Ambroise Pare insisted that an abscess was formed in the
      king&rsquo;s head, and that unless an issue were given to it, the danger of
      death would increase daily. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, and
      the curfew law, which was sternly enforced in Orleans, at this time
      practically in a state of siege, Pare&rsquo;s lamp shone from his window, and he
      was deep in study, when Lecamus called to him from below. Recognizing the
      voice of his old friend, Pare ordered that he should be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take no rest, Ambroise; while saving the lives of others you are
      wasting your own,&rdquo; said the furrier as he entered, looking at the surgeon,
      who sat, with opened books and scattered instruments, before the head of a
      dead man, lately buried and now disinterred, in which he had cut an
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter of saving the king&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of doing it, Ambroise?&rdquo; cried the old man, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I am of my own existence. The king, my old friend, has a
      morbid ulcer pressing on his brain, which will presently suffice it if no
      vent is given to it, and the danger is imminent. But by boring the skull I
      expect to release the pus and clear the head. I have already performed
      this operation three times. It was invented by a Piedmontese; but I have
      had the honor to perfect it. The first operation I performed was at the
      siege of Metz, on Monsieur de Pienne, whom I cured, who was afterwards all
      the more intelligent in consequence. His was an abscess caused by the blow
      of an arquebuse. The second was on the head of a pauper, on whom I wanted
      to prove the value of the audacious operation Monsieur de Pienne had
      allowed me to perform. The third I did in Paris on a gentleman who is now
      entirely recovered. Trepanning&mdash;that is the name given to the
      operation&mdash;is very little known. Patients refuse it, partly because
      of the imperfection of the instruments; but I have at last improved them.
      I am practising now on this skull, that I may be sure of not failing
      to-morrow, when I operate on the head of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought indeed to be very sure you are right, for your own head would
      be in danger in case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wager my life I can cure him,&rdquo; replied Ambroise, with the conviction
      of a man of genius. &ldquo;Ah! my old friend, where&rsquo;s the danger of boring into
      a skull with proper precautions? That is what soldiers do in battle every
      day of their lives, without taking any precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the burgher, boldly, &ldquo;do you know that to save the king is
      to ruin France? Do you know that this instrument of yours will place the
      crown of the Valois on the head of the Lorrain who calls himself the heir
      of Charlemagne? Do you know that surgery and policy are at this moment
      sternly opposed to each other? Yes, the triumph of your genius will be the
      death of your religion. If the Guises gain the regency, the blood of the
      Reformers will flow like water. Be a greater citizen than you are a
      surgeon; oversleep yourself to-morrow morning and leave a free field to
      the other doctors who if they cannot cure the king will cure France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Pare. &ldquo;I leave a man to die when I can cure him? No, no!
      were I to hang as an abettor of Calvin I shall go early to court. Do you
      not feel that the first and only reward I shall ask will be the life of
      your Christophe? Surely at such a moment Queen Mary can deny me nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my friend,&rdquo; returned Lecamus, &ldquo;the little king has refused the
      pardon of the Prince de Conde to the princess. Do not kill your religion
      by saving the life of a man who ought to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you meddle with God&rsquo;s ordering of the future!&rdquo; cried Pare. &ldquo;Honest
      men can have but one motto: <i>Fais ce que dois, advienne que pourra</i>!&mdash;do
      thy duty, come what will. That is what I did at the siege of Calais when I
      put my foot on the face of the Duc de Guise,&mdash;I ran the risk of being
      strangled by his friends and his servants; but to-day I am surgeon to the
      king; moreover I am of the Reformed religion; and yet the Guises are my
      friends. I shall save the king,&rdquo; cried the surgeon, with the sacred
      enthusiasm of a conviction bestowed by genius, &ldquo;and God will save France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock was heard on the street door and presently one of Pare&rsquo;s servants
      gave a paper to Lecamus, who read aloud these terrifying words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A scaffold is being erected at the convent of the Recollets: the
  Prince de Conde will be beheaded there to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Ambroise and Lecamus looked at each other with an expression of the
      deepest horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and see it for myself,&rdquo; said the furrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was he in the open street than Ruggiero took his arm and asked
      by what means Ambroise Pare proposed to save the king. Fearing some
      trickery, the old man, instead of answering, replied that he wished to go
      and see the scaffold. The astrologer accompanied him to the place des
      Recollets, and there, truly enough, they found the carpenters putting up
      the horrible framework by torchlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, my friend,&rdquo; said Lecamus to one of the men, &ldquo;what are you doing here
      at this time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are preparing for the hanging of heretics, as the blood-letting at
      Amboise didn&rsquo;t cure them,&rdquo; said a young Recollet who was superintending
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur the cardinal is very right,&rdquo; said Ruggiero, prudently; &ldquo;but
      in my country we do better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; said the young priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We burn them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus was forced to lean on the astrologer&rsquo;s arm, for his legs gave way
      beneath him; he thought it probable that on the morrow his son would hang
      from one of those gibbets. The poor old man was thrust between two
      sciences, astrology and surgery, both of which promised him the life of
      his son, for whom in all probability that scaffold was now erecting. In
      the trouble and distress of his mind, the Florentine was able to knead him
      like dough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my worthy dealer in minever, what do you say now to the Lorraine
      jokes?&rdquo; whispered Ruggiero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! you know I would give my skin if that of my son were safe and
      sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is talking like your trade,&rdquo; said the Italian; &ldquo;but explain to me
      the operation which Ambroise means to perform upon the king, and in return
      I will promise you the life of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithfully?&rdquo; exclaimed the old furrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I swear it to you?&rdquo; said Ruggiero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the poor old man repeated his conversation with Ambroise Pare to
      the astrologer, who, the moment that the secret of the great surgeon was
      divulged to him, left the poor father abruptly in the street in utter
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does he mean, that miscreant?&rdquo; cried Lecamus, as he
      watched Ruggiero hurrying with rapid steps to the place de l&rsquo;Estape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus was ignorant of the terrible scene that was taking place around
      the royal bed, where the imminent danger of the king&rsquo;s death and the
      consequent loss of power to the Guises had caused the hasty erection of
      the scaffold for the Prince de Conde, whose sentence had been pronounced,
      as it were by default,&mdash;the execution of it being delayed by the
      king&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely no one but the persons on duty were in the halls, staircases,
      and courtyard of the royal residence, Le Bailliage. The crowd of courtiers
      were flocking to the house of the king of Navarre, on whom the regency
      would devolve on the death of the king, according to the laws of the
      kingdom. The French nobility, alarmed by the audacity of the Guises, felt
      the need of rallying around the chief of the younger branch, when,
      ignorant of the queen-mother&rsquo;s Italian policy, they saw her the apparent
      slave of the duke and cardinal. Antoine de Bourbon, faithful to his secret
      agreement with Catherine, was bound not to renounce the regency in her
      favor until the States-general had declared for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude in which the king&rsquo;s house was left had a powerful effect on
      the mind of the Duc de Guise when, on his return from an inspection, made
      by way of precaution through the city, he found no one there but the
      friends who were attached exclusively to his own fortunes. The chamber in
      which was the king&rsquo;s bed adjoined the great hall of the Bailliage. It was
      at that period panelled in oak. The ceiling, composed of long, narrow
      boards carefully joined and painted, was covered with blue arabesques on a
      gold ground, a part of which being torn down about fifty years ago was
      instantly purchased by a lover of antiquities. This room, hung with
      tapestry, the floor being covered with a carpet, was so dark and gloomy
      that the torches threw scarcely any light. The vast four-post bedstead
      with its silken curtains was like a tomb. Beside her husband, close to his
      pillow, sat Mary Stuart, and near her the Cardinal de Lorraine. Catherine
      was seated in a chair at a little distance. The famous Jean Chapelain, the
      physician on duty (who was afterwards chief physician to Charles IX.) was
      standing before the fireplace. The deepest silence reigned. The young
      king, pale and shrunken, lay as if buried in his sheets, his pinched
      little face scarcely showing on the pillow. The Duchesse de Guise, sitting
      on a stool, attended Queen Mary, while on the other side, near Catherine,
      in the recess of a window, Madame de Fiesque stood watching the gestures
      and looks of the queen-mother; for she knew the dangers of her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, Monsieur de
      Cypierre, governor of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans and now appointed governor of the
      town, occupied one corner of the fireplace with the two Gondis. Cardinal
      de Tournon, who in this crisis espoused the interests of the queen-mother
      on finding himself treated as an inferior by the Cardinal de Lorraine, of
      whom he was certainly the ecclesiastical equal, talked in a low voice to
      the Gondis. The marshals de Vieilleville and Saint-Andre and the keeper of
      the seals, who presided at the States-general, were talking together in a
      whisper of the dangers to which the Guises were exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant-general of the kingdom crossed the room on his entrance,
      casting a rapid glance about him, and bowed to the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans whom he
      saw there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this will teach you to know men. The Catholic
      nobility of the kingdom have gone to pay court to a heretic prince,
      believing that the States-general will give the regency to the heirs of a
      traitor who long detained in prison your illustrious grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then having said these words, which were destined to plough a furrow in
      the heart of the young prince, he passed into the bedroom, where the king
      was not so much asleep as plunged in a heavy torpor. The Duc de Guise was
      usually able to correct the sinister aspect of his scarred face by an
      affable and pleasing manner, but on this occasion, when he saw the
      instrument of his power breaking in his very hands, he was unable to force
      a smile. The cardinal, whose civil courage was equal to his brother&rsquo;s
      military daring, advanced a few steps to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robertet thinks that little Pinard is sold to the queen-mother,&rdquo; he
      whispered, leading the duke into the hall; &ldquo;they are using him to work
      upon the members of the States-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does it signify if we are betrayed by a secretary when all
      else betrays us?&rdquo; cried the lieutenant-general. &ldquo;The town is for the
      Reformation, and we are on the eve of a revolt. Yes! the <i>Wasps</i> are
      discontented&rdquo;; he continued, giving the Orleans people their nickname;
      &ldquo;and if Pare does not save the king we shall have a terrible uprising.
      Before long we shall be forced to besiege Orleans, which is nothing but a
      bog of Huguenots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been watching that Italian woman,&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;as she sits
      there with absolute insensibility. She is watching and waiting, God
      forgive her! for the death of her son; and I ask myself whether we should
      not do a wise thing to arrest her at once, and also the king of Navarre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is already more than we want upon our hands to have the Prince de
      Conde in prison,&rdquo; replied the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a horseman riding in haste to the gate of the Bailliage
      echoed through the hall. The duke and cardinal went to the window, and by
      the light of the torches which were in the portico the duke recognized on
      the rider&rsquo;s hat the famous Lorraine cross, which the cardinal had lately
      ordered his partisans to wear. He sent an officer of the guard, who was
      stationed in the antechamber, to give entrance to the new-comer; and went
      himself, followed by his brother, to meet him on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my dear Simeuse?&rdquo; asked the duke, with that charm of manner
      which he always displayed to military men, as soon as he recognized the
      governor of Gien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Connetable has reached Pithiviers; he left Ecouen with two thousand
      cavalry and one hundred nobles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With their suites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Simeuse; &ldquo;in all, two thousand six hundred
      men. Some say that Thore is behind them with a body of infantry. If the
      Connetable delays awhile, expecting his son, you still have time to
      repulse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you know? Are the reasons of this sudden call to arms made
      known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montmorency talks as little as he writes; go you and meet him, brother,
      while I prepare to welcome him with the head of his nephew,&rdquo; said the
      cardinal, giving orders that Robertet be sent to him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vieilleville!&rdquo; cried the duke to the marechal, who came immediately. &ldquo;The
      Connetable has the audacity to come here under arms; if I go to meet him
      will you be responsible to hold the town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you leave it the burghers will fly to arms; and who can answer
      for the result of an affair between cavalry and citizens in these narrow
      streets?&rdquo; replied the marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Robertet, rushing hastily up the stairs, &ldquo;the
      Chancelier de l&rsquo;Hopital is at the gate and asks to enter; are we to let
      him in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, open the gate,&rdquo; answered the cardinal. &ldquo;Connetable and chancelier
      together would be dangerous; we must separate them. We have been boldly
      tricked by the queen-mother into choosing l&rsquo;Hopital as chancellor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robertet nodded to a captain of the guard, who awaited an answer at the
      foot of the staircase; then he turned round quickly to receive the orders
      of the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur, I take the liberty,&rdquo; he said, making one last effort, &ldquo;to
      point out that the sentence should be approved by <i>the king in council</i>.
      If you violate the law on a prince of the blood, it will not be respected
      for either a cardinal or a Duc de Guise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinard has upset your mind, Robertet,&rdquo; said the cardinal, sternly. &ldquo;Do
      you not know that the king signed the order of execution the day he was
      about to leave Orleans, in order that the sentence might be carried out in
      his absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant-general listened to this discussion without a word, but he
      took his brother by the arm and led him into a corner of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the heirs of Charlemagne have the right to
      recover the crown which was usurped from their house by Hugh Capet; but
      can they do it? The pear is not yet ripe. Our nephew is dying, and the
      whole court has gone over to the king of Navarre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s heart failed him, or the Bearnais would have been stabbed
      before now,&rdquo; said the cardinal; &ldquo;and we could easily have disposed of the
      Valois children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very ill-placed here,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;the rebellion of the town
      will be supported by the States-general. L&rsquo;Hopital, whom we protected
      while the queen-mother opposed his appointment, is to-day against us, and
      yet it is all-important that we should have the justiciary with us.
      Catherine has too many supporters at the present time; we cannot send her
      back to Italy. Besides, there are still three Valois princes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is no longer a mother, she is all queen,&rdquo; said the cardinal. &ldquo;In my
      opinion, this is the moment to make an end of her. Vigor, and more and
      more vigor! that&rsquo;s my prescription!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the cardinal returned to the king&rsquo;s chamber, followed by the
      duke. The priest went straight to the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers of Lasagne, the secretary of the Prince de Conde, have been
      communicated to you, and you now know that the Bourbons are endeavoring to
      dethrone your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, will you give orders to arrest the king of Navarre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; she said with dignity, &ldquo;a lieutenant-general of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Francois II. groaned piteously, complaining aloud of the
      terrible pains in his ear. The physician left the fireplace where he was
      warming himself, and went to the bedside to examine the king&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur?&rdquo; said the Duc de Guise, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not take upon myself to apply a blister to draw the abscess.
      Maitre Ambroise has promised to save the king&rsquo;s life by an operation, and
      I might thwart it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us postpone the treatment till to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Catherine,
      coldly, &ldquo;and order all the physicians to be present; for we all know the
      calumnies to which the death of kings gives rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to her son and kissed his hand; then she withdrew to her own
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what composure that audacious daughter of a shop-keeper alluded to
      the death of the dauphin, poisoned by Montecuculi, one of her own Italian
      followers!&rdquo; said Mary Stuart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; cried the little king, &ldquo;my grandfather never doubted her
      innocence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we prevent that woman from coming here to-morrow?&rdquo; said the queen to
      her uncles in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of us if the king dies?&rdquo; returned the cardinal, in a
      whisper. &ldquo;Catherine will shovel us all into his grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the question was plainly put between Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and the
      house of Lorraine during that fatal night. The arrival of the Connetable
      de Montmorency and the Chancelier de l&rsquo;Hopital were distinct indications
      of rebellion; the morning of the next day would therefore be decisive.

    <h2>
      XII. DEATH OF FRANCOIS II
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morrow the queen-mother was the first to enter the king&rsquo;s chamber.
      She found no one there but Mary Stuart, pale and weary, who had passed the
      night in prayer beside the bed. The Duchesse de Guise had kept her
      mistress company, and the maids of honor had taken turns in relieving one
      another. The young king slept. Neither the duke nor the cardinal had yet
      appeared. The priest, who was bolder than the soldier, had, it was
      afterward said, put forth his utmost energy during the night to induce his
      brother to make himself king. But, in face of the assembled
      States-general, and threatened by a battle with Montmorency, the Balafre
      declared the circumstances unfavorable; he refused, against his brother&rsquo;s
      utmost urgency, to arrest the king of Navarre, the queen-mother,
      l&rsquo;Hopital, the Cardinal de Tournon, the Gondis, Ruggiero, and Birago,
      objecting that such violent measures would bring on a general rebellion.
      He postponed the cardinal&rsquo;s scheme until the fate of Francois II. should
      be determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deepest silence reigned in the king&rsquo;s chamber. Catherine, accompanied
      by Madame de Fiesque, went to the bedside and gazed at her son with a
      semblance of grief that was admirably simulated. She put her handkerchief
      to her eyes and walked to the window where Madame de Fiesque brought her a
      seat. Thence she could see into the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed between Catherine and the Cardinal de Tournon that if
      the Connetable should successfully enter the town the cardinal would come
      to the king&rsquo;s house with the two Gondis; if otherwise, he would come
      alone. At nine in the morning the duke and cardinal, followed by their
      gentlemen, who remained in the hall, entered the king&rsquo;s bedroom,&mdash;the
      captain on duty having informed them that Ambroise Pare had arrived,
      together with Chapelain and three other physicians, who hated Pare and
      were all in the queen-mother&rsquo;s interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later and the great hall of the Bailliage presented much the
      same aspect as that of the Salle des gardes at Blois on the day when
      Christophe was put to the torture and the Duc de Guise was proclaimed
      lieutenant-governor of the kingdom,&mdash;with the single exception that
      whereas love and joy overflowed the royal chamber and the Guises
      triumphed, death and mourning now reigned within that darkened room, and
      the Guises felt that power was slipping through their fingers. The maids
      of honor of the two queens were again in their separate camps on either
      side of the fireplace, in which glowed a monstrous fire. The hall was
      filled with courtiers. The news&mdash;spread about, no one knew how&mdash;of
      some daring operation contemplated by Ambroise Pare to save the king&rsquo;s
      life, had brought back the lords and gentlemen who had deserted the house
      the day before. The outer staircase and courtyard were filled by an
      anxious crowd. The scaffold erected during the night for the Prince de
      Conde opposite to the convent of the Recollets, had amazed and startled
      the whole nobility. All present spoke in a low voice and the talk was the
      same mixture as at Blois, of frivolous and serious, light and earnest
      matters. The habit of expecting troubles, sudden revolutions, calls to
      arms, rebellions, and great events, which marked the long period during
      which the house of Valois was slowly being extinguished in spite of
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s great efforts to preserve it, took its rise at this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep silence prevailed for a certain distance beyond the door of the
      king&rsquo;s chamber, which was guarded by two halberdiers, two pages, and by
      the captain of the Scotch guard. Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre, held
      a prisoner in his own house, learned by his present desertion the hopes of
      the courtiers who had flocked to him the day before, and was horrified by
      the news of the preparations made during the night for the execution of
      his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing before the fireplace in the great hall of the Bailliage was one
      of the greatest and noblest figures of that day,&mdash;the Chancelier de
      l&rsquo;Hopital, wearing his crimson robe lined and edged with ermine, and his
      cap on his head according to the privilege of his office. This courageous
      man, seeing that his benefactors were traitorous and self-seeking, held
      firmly to the cause of the kings, represented by the queen-mother; at the
      risk of losing his head, he had gone to Rouen to consult with the
      Connetable de Montmorency. No one ventured to draw him from the reverie in
      which he was plunged. Robertet, the secretary of State, two marshals of
      France, Vieilleville, and Saint-Andre, and the keeper of the seals, were
      collected in a group before the chancellor. The courtiers present were not
      precisely jesting; but their talk was malicious, especially among those
      who were not for the Guises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently voices were heard to rise in the king&rsquo;s chamber. The two
      marshals, Robertet, and the chancellor went nearer to the door; for not
      only was the life of the king in question, but, as the whole court knew
      well, the chancellor, the queen-mother, and her adherents were in the
      utmost danger. A deep silence fell on the whole assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambroise Pare had by this time examined the king&rsquo;s head; he thought the
      moment propitious for his operation; if it was not performed suffusion
      would take place, and Francois II. might die at any moment. As soon as the
      duke and cardinal entered the chamber he explained to all present that in
      so urgent a case it was necessary to trepan the head, and he now waited
      till the king&rsquo;s physician ordered him to perform the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut the head of my son as though it were a plank!&mdash;with that
      horrible instrument!&rdquo; cried Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. &ldquo;Maitre Ambroise, I will
      not permit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physicians were consulting together; but Catherine spoke in so loud a
      voice that her words reached, as she intended they should, beyond the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, if there is no other way to save him?&rdquo; said Mary Stuart,
      weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambroise,&rdquo; cried Catherine; &ldquo;remember that your head will answer for the
      king&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are opposed to the treatment suggested by Maitre Ambroise,&rdquo; said the
      three physicians. &ldquo;The king can be saved by injecting through the ear a
      remedy which will draw the contents of the abscess through that passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duc de Guise, who was watching Catherine&rsquo;s face, suddenly went up to
      her and drew her into the recess of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you wish the death of your son; you are in league with
      our enemies, and have been since Blois. This morning the Counsellor Viole
      told the son of your furrier that the Prince de Conde&rsquo;s head was about to
      be cut off. That young man, who, when the question was applied, persisted
      in denying all relations with the prince, made a sign of farewell to him
      as he passed before the window of his dungeon. You saw your unhappy
      accomplice tortured with royal insensibility. You are now endeavoring to
      prevent the recovery of your eldest son. Your conduct forces us to believe
      that the death of the dauphin, which placed the crown on your husband&rsquo;s
      head was not a natural one, and that Montecuculi was your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le chancilier!&rdquo; cried Catherine, at a sign from whom Madame de
      Fiesque opened both sides of the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company in the hall then saw the scene that was taking place in the
      royal chamber: the livid little king, his face half dead, his eyes
      sightless, his lips stammering the word &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; as he held the hand of the
      weeping queen; the Duchesse de Guise motionless, frightened by Catherine&rsquo;s
      daring act; the duke and cardinal, also alarmed, keeping close to the
      queen-mother and resolving to have her arrested on the spot by
      Maille-Breze; lastly, the tall Ambroise Pare, assisted by the king&rsquo;s
      physician, holding his instrument in his hand but not daring to begin the
      operation, for which composure and total silence were as necessary as the
      consent of the other surgeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le chancelier,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;the Messieurs de Guise wish to
      authorize a strange operation upon the person of the king; Ambroise Pare
      is preparing to cut open his head. I, as the king&rsquo;s mother and a member of
      the council of the regency,&mdash;I protest against what appears to me a
      crime of <i>lese-majeste</i>. The king&rsquo;s physicians advise an injection
      through the ear, which seems to me as efficacious and less dangerous than
      the brutal operation proposed by Pare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the company in the hall heard these words a smothered murmur rose
      from their midst; the cardinal allowed the chancellor to enter the bedroom
      and then he closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lieutenant-general of the kingdom,&rdquo; said the Duc de Guise; &ldquo;and I
      would have you know, Monsieur le chancelier, that Ambroise, the king&rsquo;s
      surgeon, answers for his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if this be the turn that things are taking!&rdquo; exclaimed Ambroise Pare.
      &ldquo;I know my rights and how I should proceed.&rdquo; He stretched his arm over the
      bed. &ldquo;This bed and the king are mine. I claim to be sole master of this
      case and solely responsible. I know the duties of my office; I shall
      operate upon the king without the sanction of the physicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him!&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;and you shall be the richest man in
      France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried Mary Stuart, pressing the surgeon&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot prevent it,&rdquo; said the chancellor; &ldquo;but I shall record the
      protest of the queen-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robertet!&rdquo; called the Duc de Guise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Robertet entered, the lieutenant-general pointed to the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appoint you chancellor of France in the place of that traitor,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Monsieur de Maille, take Monsieur de l&rsquo;Hopital and put him in the
      prison of the Prince de Conde. As for you, madame,&rdquo; he added, turning to
      Catherine; &ldquo;your protest will not be received; you ought to be aware that
      any such protest must be supported by sufficient force. I act as the
      faithful subject and loyal servant of king Francois II., my master. Go on,
      Antoine,&rdquo; he added, looking at the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Guise,&rdquo; said l&rsquo;Hopital; &ldquo;if you employ violence either upon
      the king or upon the chancellor of France, remember that enough of the
      nobility of France are in that hall to rise and arrest you as a traitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my lords,&rdquo; cried the great surgeon; &ldquo;if you continue these arguments
      you will soon proclaim Charles IX!&mdash;for king Francois is about to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, absolutely impassive, gazed from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we shall employ force to make ourselves masters of this
      room,&rdquo; said the cardinal, advancing to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he opened it even he was terrified; the whole house was deserted!
      The courtiers, certain now of the death of the king, had gone in a body to
      the king of Navarre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on, perform your duty,&rdquo; cried Mary Stuart, vehemently, to
      Ambroise. &ldquo;I&mdash;and you, duchess,&rdquo; she said to Madame de Guise,&mdash;&ldquo;will
      protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Ambroise; &ldquo;my zeal was carrying me away. The doctors, with
      the exception of my friend Chapelain, prefer an injection, and it is my
      duty to submit to their wishes. If I had been chief surgeon and chief
      physician, which I am not, the king&rsquo;s life would probably have been saved.
      Give that to me, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, stretching out his hand for the
      syringe, which he proceeded to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Mary Start, &ldquo;but I order you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! madame,&rdquo; said Ambroise, &ldquo;I am under the direction of these
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young queen placed herself between the surgeon, the doctors, and the
      other persons present. The chief physician held the king&rsquo;s head, and
      Ambroise made the injection into the ear. The duke and the cardinal
      watched the proceeding attentively. Robertet and Monsieur de Maille stood
      motionless. Madame de Fiesque, at a sign from Catherine, glided
      unperceived from the room. A moment later l&rsquo;Hopital boldly opened the door
      of the king&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arrive in good time,&rdquo; said the voice of a man whose hasty steps echoed
      through the great hall, and who stood the next moment on the threshold of
      the open door. &ldquo;Ah, messieurs, so you meant to take off the head of my
      good nephew, the Prince de Conde? Instead of that, you have forced the
      lion from his lair and&mdash;here I am!&rdquo; added the Connetable de
      Montmorency. &ldquo;Ambroise, you shall not plunge your knife into the head of
      my king. The first prince of the blood, Antoine de Bourbon, the Prince de
      Conde, the queen-mother, the Connetable, and the chancellor forbid the
      operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Catherine&rsquo;s great satisfaction, the king of Navarre and the Prince de
      Conde now entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; said the Duc de Guise, laying his hand on his
      dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that in my capacity as Connetable, I have dismissed the
      sentinels of all your posts. <i>Tete Dieu</i>! you are not in an enemy&rsquo;s
      country, methinks. The king, our master, is in the midst of his loyal
      subjects, and the States-general must be suffered to deliberate at
      liberty. I come, messieurs, from the States-general. I carried the protest
      of my nephew de Conde before that assembly, and three hundred of those
      gentlemen have released him. You wish to shed royal blood and to decimate
      the nobility of the kingdom, do you? Ha! in future, I defy you, and all
      your schemes, Messieurs de Lorraine. If you order the king&rsquo;s head opened,
      by this sword which saved France from Charles V., I say it shall not be
      done&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more,&rdquo; said Ambroise Pare; &ldquo;because it is now too late; the
      suffusion has begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reign is over, messieurs,&rdquo; said Catherine to the Guises, seeing from
      Pare&rsquo;s face that there was no longer any hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame, you have killed your own son,&rdquo; cried Mary Stuart as she
      bounded like a lioness from the bed to the window and seized the
      queen-mother by the arm, gripping it violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Catherine, giving her daughter-in-law a cold, keen
      glance in which she allowed her hatred, repressed for the last six months,
      to overflow; &ldquo;you, to whose inordinate love we owe this death, you will
      now go to reign in your Scotland, and you will start to-morrow. I am
      regent <i>de facto</i>.&rdquo; The three physicians having made her a sign,
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; she added, addressing the Guises, &ldquo;it is agreed between
      Monsieur de Bourbon, appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom by the
      States-general, and me that the conduct of the affairs of the State is our
      business solely. Come, monsieur le chancelier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is dead!&rdquo; said the Duc de Guise, compelled to perform his duties
      as Grand-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live King Charles IX.!&rdquo; cried all the noblemen who had come with the
      king of Navarre, the Prince de Conde, and the Connetable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremonies which follow the death of a king of France were performed
      in almost total solitude. When the king-at-arms proclaimed aloud three
      times in the hall, &ldquo;The king is dead!&rdquo; there were very few persons present
      to reply, &ldquo;Vive le roi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother, to whom the Comtesse de Fiesque had brought the Duc
      d&rsquo;Orleans, now Charles IX., left the chamber, leading her son by the hand,
      and all the remaining courtiers followed her. No one was left in the house
      where Francois II. had drawn his last breath, but the duke and the
      cardinal, the Duchesse de Guise, Mary Stuart, and Dayelle, together with
      the sentries at the door, the pages of the Grand-master, those of the
      cardinal, and their private secretaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vive la France!&rdquo; cried several Reformers in the street, sounding the
      first cry of the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robertet, who owed all he was to the duke and cardinal, terrified by their
      scheme and its present failure, went over secretly to the queen-mother,
      whom the ambassadors of Spain, England, the Empire, and Poland, hastened
      to meet on the staircase, brought thither by Cardinal de Tournon, who had
      gone to notify them as soon as he had made Queen Catherine a sign from the
      courtyard at the moment when she protested against the operation of
      Ambroise Pare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the cardinal to the duke, &ldquo;so the sons of Louis d&rsquo;Outre-mer,
      the heirs of Charles de Lorraine flinched and lacked courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should have been exiled to Lorraine,&rdquo; replied the duke. &ldquo;I declare to
      you, Charles, that if the crown lay there before me I would not stretch
      out my hand to pick it up. That&rsquo;s for my son to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he have, as you have had, the army and Church on his side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have something better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Stuart, clasping the stiffened hand of her first
      husband, now dead, &ldquo;there is none but me to weep for this poor boy who
      loved me so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we patch up matters with the queen-mother?&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till she quarrels with the Huguenots,&rdquo; replied the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conflicting interests of the house of Bourbon, of Catherine, of the
      Guises, and of the Reformed party produced such confusion in the town of
      Orleans that, three days after the king&rsquo;s death, his body, completely
      forgotten in the Bailliage and put into a coffin by the menials of the
      house, was taken to Saint-Denis in a covered waggon, accompanied only by
      the Bishop of Senlis and two gentlemen. When the pitiable procession
      reached the little town of Etampes, a servant of the Chancelier l&rsquo;Hopital
      fastened to the waggon this severe inscription, which history has
      preserved: &ldquo;Tanneguy de Chastel, where art thou? and yet thou wert a
      Frenchman!&rdquo;&mdash;a stern reproach, which fell with equal force on
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, Mary Stuart, and the Guises. What Frenchman does not
      know that Tanneguy de Chastel spent thirty thousand crowns of the coinage
      of that day (one million of our francs) at the funeral of Charles VII.,
      the benefactor of his house?
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did the tolling of the bells announce to the town of Orleans
      that Francois II. was dead, and the rumor spread that the Connetable de
      Montmorency had ordered the flinging open of the gates of the town, than
      Tourillon, the glover, rushed up into the garret of his house and went to
      a secret hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! can he be dead?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words, a man rose to his feet and answered, &ldquo;Ready to serve!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      password of the Reformers who belonged to Calvin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was Chaudieu, to whom Tourillon now related the events of the
      last eight days, during which time he had prudently left the minister
      alone in his hiding-place with a twelve-pound loaf of bread for his sole
      nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go instantly to the Prince de Conde, brother: ask him to give me a
      safe-conduct; and find me a horse,&rdquo; cried the minister. &ldquo;I must start at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write me a line, or he will not receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, after writing a few words, &ldquo;ask for a pass from the
      king of Navarre, for I must go to Geneva without a moment&rsquo;s loss of time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIII. CALVIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two hours later all was ready, and the ardent minister was on his way to
      Switzerland, accompanied by a nobleman in the service of the king of
      Navarre (of whom Chaudieu pretended to be the secretary), carrying with
      him despatches from the Reformers in the Dauphine. This sudden departure
      was chiefly in the interests of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, who, in order to
      gain time to establish her power, had made a bold proposition to the
      Reformers which was kept a profound secret. This strange proceeding
      explains the understanding so suddenly apparent between herself and the
      leaders of the Reform. The wily woman gave, as a pledge of her good faith,
      an intimation of her desire to heal all differences between the two
      churches by calling an assembly, which should be neither a council, nor a
      conclave, nor a synod, but should be known by some new and distinctive
      name, if Calvin consented to the project. When this secret was afterwards
      divulged (be it remarked in passing) it led to an alliance between the Duc
      de Guise and the Connetable de Montmorency against Catherine and the king
      of Navarre,&mdash;a strange alliance! known in history as the Triumvirate,
      the Marechal de Saint-Andre being the third personage in the purely
      Catholic coalition to which this singular proposition for a &ldquo;colloquy&rdquo;
       gave rise. The secret of Catherine&rsquo;s wily policy was rightly understood by
      the Guises; they felt certain that the queen cared nothing for this
      mysterious assembly, and was only temporizing with her new allies in order
      to secure a period of peace until the majority of Charles IX.; but none
      the less did they deceive the Connetable into fearing a collusion of real
      interests between the queen and the Bourbons,&mdash;whereas, in reality,
      Catherine was playing them all one against another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen had become, as the reader will perceive, extremely powerful in a
      very short time. The spirit of discussion and controversy which now sprang
      up was singularly favorable to her position. The Catholics and the
      Reformers were equally pleased to exhibit their brilliancy one after
      another in this tournament of words; for that is what it actually was, and
      no more. It is extraordinary that historians have mistaken one of the
      wiliest schemes of the great queen for uncertainty and hesitation!
      Catherine never went more directly to her own ends than in just such
      schemes which appeared to thwart them. The king of Navarre, quite
      incapable of understanding her motives, fell into her plan in all
      sincerity, and despatched Chaudieu to Calvin, as we have seen. The
      minister had risked his life to be secretly in Orleans and watch events;
      for he was, while there, in hourly peril of being discovered and hung as a
      man under sentence of banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the then fashion of travelling, Chaudieu could not reach
      Geneva before the month of February, and the negotiations were not likely
      to be concluded before the end of March; consequently the assembly could
      certainly not take place before the month of May, 1561. Catherine,
      meantime, intended to amuse the court and the various conflicting
      interests by the coronation of the king, and the ceremonies of his first
      &ldquo;lit de justice,&rdquo; at which l&rsquo;Hopital and de Thou recorded the
      letters-patent by which Charles IX. confided the administration to his
      mother in common with the present lieutenant-general of the kingdom,
      Antoine de Navarre, the weakest prince of those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not a strange spectacle this of the great kingdom of France waiting
      in suspense for the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; of a French burgher, hitherto an obscure
      man, living for many years past in Geneva? The transalpine pope held in
      check by the pontiff of Geneva! The two Lorrain princes, lately
      all-powerful, now paralyzed by the momentary coalition of the queen-mother
      and the first prince of the blood with Calvin! Is not this, I say, one of
      the most instructive lessons ever given to kings by history,&mdash;a
      lesson which should teach them to study men, to seek out genius, and
      employ it, as did Louis XIV., wherever God has placed it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin, whose name was not Calvin but Cauvin, was the son of a cooper at
      Noyon in Picardy. The region of his birth explains in some degree the
      obstinacy combined with capricious eagerness which distinguished this
      arbiter of the destinies of France in the sixteenth century. Nothing is
      less known than the nature of this man, who gave birth to Geneva and to
      the spirit that emanated from that city. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who had
      very little historical knowledge, has completely ignored the influence of
      Calvin on his republic. At first the embryo Reformer, who lived in one of
      the humblest houses in the upper town, near the church of Saint-Pierre,
      over a carpenter&rsquo;s shop (first resemblance between him and Robespierre),
      had no great authority in Geneva. In fact for a long time his power was
      malevolently checked by the Genevese. The town was the residence in those
      days of a citizen whose fame, like that of several others, remained
      unknown to the world at large and for a time to Geneva itself. This man,
      Farel, about the year 1537, detained Calvin in Geneva, pointing out to him
      that the place could be made the safe centre of a reformation more active
      and thorough than that of Luther. Farel and Calvin regarded Lutheranism as
      an incomplete work,&mdash;insufficient in itself and without any real grip
      upon France. Geneva, midway between France and Italy, and speaking the
      French language, was admirably situated for ready communication with
      Germany, France, and Italy. Calvin thereupon adopted Geneva as the site of
      his moral fortunes; he made it thenceforth the citadel of his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Geneva, at Farel&rsquo;s entreaty, authorized Calvin in
      September, 1538, to give lectures on theology. Calvin left the duties of
      the ministry to Farel, his first disciple, and gave himself up patiently
      to the work of teaching his doctrine. His authority, which became so
      absolute in the last years of his life, was obtained with difficulty and
      very slowly. The great agitator met with such serious obstacles that he
      was banished for a time from Geneva on account of the severity of his
      reform. A party of honest citizens still clung to their old luxury and
      their old customs. But, as usually happens, these good people, fearing
      ridicule, would not admit the real object of their efforts, and kept up
      their warfare against the new doctrines on points altogether foreign to
      the real question. Calvin insisted that <i>leavened bread</i> should be
      used for the communion, and that all feasts should be abolished except
      Sundays. These innovations were disapproved of at Berne and at Lausanne.
      Notice was served on the Genevese to conform to the ritual of Switzerland.
      Calvin and Farel resisted; their political opponents used this
      disobedience to drive them from Geneva, whence they were, in fact,
      banished for several years. Later Calvin returned triumphantly at the
      demand of his flock. Such persecutions always become in the end the
      consecration of a moral power; and, in this case, Calvin&rsquo;s return was the
      beginning of his era as prophet. He then organized his religious Terror,
      and the executions began. On his reappearance in the city he was admitted
      into the ranks of the Genevese burghers; but even then, after fourteen
      years&rsquo; residence, he was not made a member of the Council. At the time of
      which we write, when Catherine sent her envoy to him, this king of ideas
      had no other title than that of &ldquo;pastor of the Church of Geneva.&rdquo;
       Moreover, Calvin never in his life received a salary of more than one
      hundred and fifty francs in money yearly, fifteen hundred-weight of wheat,
      and two barrels of wine. His brother, a tailor, kept a shop close to the
      place Saint-Pierre, in a street now occupied by one of the large printing
      establishments of Geneva. Such personal disinterestedness, which was
      lacking in Voltaire, Newton, and Bacon, but eminent in the lives of
      Rabelais, Spinosa, Loyola, Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is indeed a
      magnificent frame to those ardent and sublime figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The career of Robespierre can alone picture to the minds of the present
      day that of Calvin, who, founding his power on the same bases, was as
      despotic and as cruel as the lawyer of Arras. It is a noticeable fact that
      Picardy (Arras and Noyon) furnished both these instruments of reformation!
      Persons who wish to study the motives of the executions ordered by Calvin
      will find, all relations considered, another 1793 in Geneva. Calvin cut
      off the head of Jacques Gruet &ldquo;for having written impious letters,
      libertine verses, and for working to overthrow ecclesiastical ordinances.&rdquo;
       Reflect upon that sentence, and ask yourselves if the worst tyrants in
      their saturnalias ever gave more horribly burlesque reasons for their
      cruelties. Valentin Gentilis, condemned to death for &ldquo;involuntary heresy,&rdquo;
       escaped execution only by making a submission far more ignominious than
      was ever imposed by the Catholic Church. Seven years before the conference
      which was now to take place in Calvin&rsquo;s house on the proposals of the
      queen-mother, Michel Servet, <i>a Frenchman</i>, travelling through
      Switzerland, was arrested at Geneva, tried, condemned, and burned alive,
      on Calvin&rsquo;s accusation, for having &ldquo;attacked the mystery of the Trinity,&rdquo;
       in a book which was neither written nor published in Geneva. Remember the
      eloquent remonstrance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose book, overthrowing
      the Catholic religion, written in France and published in Holland, was
      burned by the hangman, while the author, a foreigner, was merely banished
      from the kingdom where he had endeavored to destroy the fundamental proofs
      of religion and of authority. Compare the conduct of our Parliament with
      that of the Genevese tyrant. Again: Bolsee was brought to trial for
      &ldquo;having other ideas than those of Calvin on predestination.&rdquo; Consider
      these things, and ask yourselves if Fourquier-Tinville did worse. The
      savage religious intolerance of Calvin was, morally speaking, more
      implacable than the savage political intolerance of Robespierre. On a
      larger stage than that of Geneva, Calvin would have shed more blood than
      did the terrible apostle of political equality as opposed to Catholic
      equality. Three centuries earlier a monk of Picardy drove the whole West
      upon the East. Peter the Hermit, Calvin, and Robespierre, each at an
      interval of three hundred years and all three from the same region, were,
      politically speaking, the Archimedean screws of their age,&mdash;at each
      epoch a Thought which found its fulcrum in the self-interest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin was undoubtedly the maker of that melancholy town called Geneva,
      where, only ten years ago, a man said, pointing to a porte-cochere in the
      upper town, the first ever built there: &ldquo;By that door luxury has invaded
      Geneva.&rdquo; Calvin gave birth, by the sternness of his doctrines and his
      executions, to that form of hypocritical sentiment called &ldquo;cant.&rdquo;[*]
      According to those who practice it, good morals consist in renouncing the
      arts and the charms of life, in eating richly but without luxury, in
      silently amassing money without enjoying it otherwise than as Calvin
      enjoyed power&mdash;by thought. Calvin imposed on all the citizens of his
      adopted town the same gloomy pall which he spread over his own life. He
      created in the Consistory a Calvinistic inquisition, absolutely similar to
      the revolutionary tribunal of Robespierre. The Consistory denounced the
      persons to be condemned to the Council, and Calvin ruled the Council
      through the Consistory, just as Robespierre ruled the Convention through
      the Club of the Jacobins. In this way an eminent magistrate of Geneva was
      condemned to two months&rsquo; imprisonment, the loss of all his offices, and
      the right of ever obtaining others &ldquo;because he led a disorderly life and
      was intimate with Calvin&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo; Calvin thus became a legislator. He
      created the austere, sober, commonplace, and hideously sad, but
      irreproachable manners and customs which characterize Geneva to the
      present day,&mdash;customs preceding those of England called Puritanism,
      which were due to the Cameronians, disciples of Cameron (a Frenchman
      deriving his doctrine from Calvin), whom Sir Walter Scott depicts so
      admirably. The poverty of a man, a sovereign master, who negotiated, power
      to power, with kings, demanding armies and subsidies, and plunging both
      hands into their savings laid aside for the unfortunate, proves that
      thought, used solely as a means of domination, gives birth to political
      misers,&mdash;men who enjoy by their brains only, and, like the Jesuits,
      want power for power&rsquo;s sake. Pitt, Luther, Calvin, Robespierre, all those
      Harpagons of power, died without a penny. The inventory taken in Calvin&rsquo;s
      house after his death, which comprised all his property, even his books,
      amounted in value, as history records, to two hundred and fifty francs.
      That of Luther came to about the same sum; his widow, the famous Catherine
      de Bora, was forced to petition for a pension of five hundred francs,
      which as granted to her by an Elector of Germany. Potemkin, Richelieu,
      Mazarin, those men of thought and action, all three of whom made or laid
      the foundation of empires, each left over three hundred millions behind
      them. They had hearts; they loved women and the arts; they built, they
      conquered; whereas with the exception of the wife of Luther, the Helen of
      that Iliad, all the others had no tenderness, no beating of the heart for
      any woman with which to reproach themselves.

     [*] <i>Momerie</i>.

    <p>
      This brief digression was necessary in order to explain Calvin&rsquo;s position
      in Geneva.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first days of the month of February in the year 1561, on a
      soft, warm evening such as we may sometimes find at that season on Lake
      Leman, two horsemen arrived at the Pre-l&rsquo;Eveque,&mdash;thus called because
      it was the former country-place of the Bishop of Geneva, driven from
      Switzerland about thirty years earlier. These horsemen, who no doubt knew
      the laws of Geneva about the closing of the gates (then a necessity and
      now very ridiculous) rode in the direction of the Porte de Rive; but they
      stopped their horses suddenly on catching sight of a man, about fifty
      years of age, leaning on the arm of a servant-woman, and walking slowly
      toward the town. This man, who was rather stout, walked with difficulty,
      putting one foot after the other with pain apparently, for he wore round
      shoes of black velvet, laced in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; said Chaudieu to the other horseman, who immediately
      dismounted, threw the reins to his companion, and went forward, opening
      wide his arms to the man on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, who was Jean Calvin, drew back to avoid the embrace, casting a
      stern look at his disciple. At fifty years of age Calvin looked as though
      he were sixty. Stout and stocky in figure, he seemed shorter still because
      the horrible sufferings of stone in the bladder obliged him to bend almost
      double as he walked. These pains were complicated by attacks of gout of
      the worst kind. Every one trembled before that face, almost as broad as it
      was long, on which, in spite of its roundness, there was as little
      human-kindness as on that of Henry the Eighth, whom Calvin greatly
      resembled. Sufferings which gave him no respite were manifest in the
      deep-cut lines starting from each side of the nose and following the curve
      of the moustache till they were lost in the thick gray beard. This face,
      though red and inflamed like that of a heavy drinker, showed spots where
      the skin was yellow. In spite of the velvet cap, which covered the huge
      square head, a vast forehead of noble shape could be seen and admired;
      beneath it shone two dark eyes, which must have flashed forth flame in
      moments of anger. Whether by reason of his obesity, or because of his
      thick, short neck, or in consequence of his vigils and his constant
      labors, Calvin&rsquo;s head was sunk between his broad shoulders, which obliged
      him to wear a fluted ruff of very small dimensions, on which his face
      seemed to lie like the head of John the Baptist on a charger. Between his
      moustache and his beard could be seen, like a rose, his small and fresh
      and eloquent little mouth, shaped in perfection. The face was divided by a
      square nose, remarkable for the flexibility of its entire length, the tip
      of which was significantly flat, seeming the more in harmony with the
      prodigious power expressed by the form of that imperial head. Though it
      might have been difficult to discover on his features any trace of the
      weekly headaches which tormented Calvin in the intervals of the slow fever
      that consumed him, suffering, ceaselessly resisted by study and by will,
      gave to that mask, superficially so florid, a certain something that was
      terrible. Perhaps this impression was explainable by the color of a sort
      of greasy layer on the skin, due to the sedentary habits of the toiler,
      showing evidence of the perpetual struggle which went on between that
      valetudinarian temperament and one of the strongest wills ever known in
      the history of the human mind. The mouth, though charming, had an
      expression of cruelty. Chastity, necessitated by vast designs, exacted by
      so many sickly conditions, was written upon that face. Regrets were there,
      notwithstanding the serenity of that all-powerful brow, together with pain
      in the glance of those eyes, the calmness of which was terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin&rsquo;s costume brought into full relief this powerful head. He wore the
      well-known cassock of black cloth, fastened round his waist by a black
      cloth belt with a brass buckle, which became thenceforth the distinctive
      dress of all Calvinist ministers, and was so uninteresting to the eye that
      it forced the spectator&rsquo;s attention upon the wearer&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suffer too much, Theodore, to embrace you,&rdquo; said Calvin to the elegant
      cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore de Beze, then forty-two years of age and lately admitted, at
      Calvin&rsquo;s request, as a Genevese burgher, formed a violent contrast to the
      terrible pastor whom he had chosen as his sovereign guide and ruler.
      Calvin, like all burghers raised to moral sovereignty, and all inventors
      of social systems, was eaten up with jealousy. He abhorred his disciples;
      he wanted no equals; he could not bear the slightest contradiction. Yet
      there was between him and this graceful cavalier so marked a difference,
      Theodore de Beze was gifted with so charming a personality enhanced by a
      politeness trained by court life, and Calvin felt him to be so unlike his
      other surly janissaries, that the stern reformer departed in de Beze&rsquo;s
      case from his usual habits. He never loved him, for this harsh legislator
      totally ignored all friendship, but, not fearing him in the light of a
      successor, he liked to play with Theodore as Richelieu played with his
      cat; he found him supple and agile. Seeing how admirably de Beze succeeded
      in all his missions, he took a fancy to the polished instrument of which
      he knew himself the mainspring and the manipulator; so true is it that the
      sternest of men cannot do without some semblance of affection. Theodore
      was Calvin&rsquo;s spoilt child; the harsh reformer never scolded him; he
      forgave him his dissipations, his amours, his fine clothes and his
      elegance of language. Perhaps Calvin was not unwilling to show that the
      Reformation had a few men of the world to compare with the men of the
      court. Theodore de Beze was anxious to introduce a taste for the arts, for
      literature, and for poesy into Geneva, and Calvin listened to his plans
      without knitting his thick gray eyebrows. Thus the contrast of character
      and person between these two celebrated men was as complete and marked as
      the difference in their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin acknowledged Chaudieu&rsquo;s very humble salutation by a slight
      inclination of the head. Chaudieu slipped the bridles of both horses
      through his arms and followed the two great men of the Reformation,
      walking to the left, behind de Beze, who was on Calvin&rsquo;s right. The
      servant-woman hastened on in advance to prevent the closing of the Porte
      de Rive, by informing the captain of the guard that Calvin had been seized
      with sudden acute pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore de Beze was a native of the canton of Vezelay, which was the
      first to enter the Confederation, the curious history of which transaction
      has been written by one of the Thierrys. The burgher spirit of resistance,
      endemic at Vezelay, no doubt, played its part in the person of this man,
      in the great revolt of the Reformers; for de Beze was undoubtedly one of
      the most singular personalities of the Heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suffer still?&rdquo; said Theodore to Calvin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Catholic would say, &lsquo;like a lost soul,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied the Reformer, with the
      bitterness he gave to his slightest remarks. &ldquo;Ah! I shall not be here
      long, my son. What will become of you without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall fight by the light of your books,&rdquo; said Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvin smiled; his red face changed to a pleased expression, and he looked
      favorably at Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you brought me news? Have they massacred many of our people?&rdquo;
       he said smiling, and letting a sarcastic joy shine in his brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, &ldquo;all is peaceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse,&rdquo; cried Calvin; &ldquo;so much the worse! All pacification is
      an evil, if indeed it is not a trap. Our strength lies in persecution.
      Where should we be if the Church accepted Reform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;that is precisely what the queen-mother appears to
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is capable of it,&rdquo; remarked Calvin. &ldquo;I study that woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, at this distance?&rdquo; cried Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any distance for the mind?&rdquo; replied Calvin, sternly, for he
      thought the interruption irreverent. &ldquo;Catherine seeks power, and women
      with that in their eye have neither honor nor faith. But what is she doing
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring you a proposal from her to call a species of council,&rdquo; replied
      Theodore de Beze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near Paris?&rdquo; asked Calvin, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! so much the better!&rdquo; exclaimed the Reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to try to understand each other and draw up some public agreement
      which shall unite the two churches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if she would only have the courage to separate the French Church from
      the court of Rome, and create a patriarch for France as they did in the
      Greek Church!&rdquo; cried Calvin, his eyes glistening at the idea thus
      presented to his mind of a possible throne. &ldquo;But, my son, can the niece of
      a Pope be sincere? She is only trying to gain time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has sent away the Queen of Scots,&rdquo; said Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One less!&rdquo; remarked Calvin, as they passed through the Porte de Rive.
      &ldquo;Elizabeth of England will restrain that one for us. Two neighboring
      queens will soon be at war with each other. One is handsome, the other
      ugly,&mdash;a first cause for irritation; besides, there&rsquo;s the question of
      illegitimacy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands, and the character of his joy was so evidently
      ferocious that de Beze shuddered: he saw the sea of blood his master was
      contemplating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Guises have irritated the house of Bourbon,&rdquo; said Theodore after a
      pause. &ldquo;They came to an open rupture at Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Calvin, &ldquo;you would not believe me, my son, when I told you the
      last time you started for Nerac that we should end by stirring up war to
      the death between the two branches of the house of France? I have, at
      least, one court, one king and royal family on my side. My doctrine is
      producing its effect upon the masses. The burghers, too, understand me;
      they regard as idolators all who go to Mass, who paint the walls of their
      churches, and put pictures and statues within them. Ha! it is far more
      easy for a people to demolish churches and palaces than to argue the
      question of justification by faith, or the real presence. Luther was an
      argufier, but I,&mdash;I am an army! He was a reasoner, I am a system. In
      short, my sons, he was merely a skirmisher, but I am Tarquin! Yes, <i>my</i>
      faithful shall destroy pictures and pull down churches; they shall make
      mill-stones of statues to grind the flour of the peoples. There are guilds
      and corporations in the States-general&mdash;I will have nothing there but
      individuals. Corporations resist; they see clear where the masses are
      blind. We must join to our doctrine political interests which will
      consolidate it, and keep together the <i>materiel</i> of my armies. I have
      satisfied the logic of cautious souls and the minds of thinkers by this
      bared and naked worship which carries religion into the world of ideas; I
      have made the peoples understand the advantages of suppressing ceremony.
      It is for you, Theodore, to enlist their interests; hold to that; go not
      beyond it. All is said in the way of doctrine; let no one add one iota.
      Why does Cameron, that little Gascon pastor, presume to write of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calvin, de Beze, and Chaudieu were mounting the steep steps of the upper
      town in the midst of a crowd, but the crowd paid not the slightest
      attention to the men who were unchaining the mobs of other cities and
      preparing them to ravage France.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this terrible tirade, the three marched on in silence till they
      entered the little place Saint-Pierre and turned toward the pastor&rsquo;s
      house. On the second story of that house (never noted, and of which in
      these days no one is ever told in Geneva, where, it may be remarked,
      Calvin has no statue) his lodging consisted of three chambers with common
      pine floors and wainscots, at the end of which were the kitchen and the
      bedroom of his woman-servant. The entrance, as usually happened in most of
      the burgher households of Geneva, was through the kitchen, which opened
      into a little room with two windows, serving as parlor, salon, and
      dining-room. Calvin&rsquo;s study, where his thought had wrestled with suffering
      for the last fourteen years, came next, with the bedroom beyond it. Four
      oaken chairs covered with tapestry and placed around a square table were
      the sole furniture of the parlor. A stove of white porcelain, standing in
      one corner of the room, cast out a gentle heat. Panels and a wainscot of
      pine wood left in its natural state without decoration covered the walls.
      Thus the nakedness of the place was in keeping with the sober and simple
      life of the Reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said de Beze as they entered, profiting by a few moments when
      Chaudieu left them to put up the horse at a neighboring inn, &ldquo;what am I to
      do? Will you agree to the colloquy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Calvin. &ldquo;And it is you, my son, who will fight for us
      there. Be peremptory, be arbitrary. No one, neither the queen nor the
      Guises nor I, wants a pacification; it would not suit us at all. I have
      confidence in Duplessis-Mornay; let him play the leading part. Are we
      alone?&rdquo; he added, with a glance of distrust into the kitchen, where two
      shirts and a few collars were stretched on a line to dry. &ldquo;Go and shut all
      the doors. Well,&rdquo; he continued when Theodore had returned, &ldquo;we must drive
      the king of Navarre to join the Guises and the Connetable by advising him
      to break with Queen Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. Let us all get the benefit of
      that poor creature&rsquo;s weakness. If he turns against the Italian she will,
      when she sees herself deprived of that support, necessarily unite with the
      Prince de Conde and Coligny. Perhaps this manoeuvre will so compromise her
      that she will be forced to remain on our side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore de Beze caught the hem of Calvin&rsquo;s cassock and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my master,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how great you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, my dear Theodore, I am dying. If I die without seeing you
      again,&rdquo; he added, sinking his voice and speaking in the ear of his
      minister of foreign affairs, &ldquo;remember to strike a great blow by the hand
      of some one of our martyrs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another Minard to be killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something better than a mere lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still better!&mdash;a man who wants to be a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duc de Guise!&rdquo; exclaimed Theodore, with an involuntary gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Calvin, who thought he saw disappointment or resistance in
      the gesture, and did not see at the same moment the entrance of Chaudieu.
      &ldquo;Have we not the right to strike as we are struck?&mdash;yes, to strike in
      silence and in darkness. May we not return them wound for wound, and death
      for death? Would the Catholics hesitate to lay traps for us and massacre
      us? Assuredly not. Let us burn their churches! Forward, my children! And
      if you have devoted youths&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use them as engines of war! our cause justifies all means. Le Balafre,
      that horrible soldier, is, like me, more than a man; he is a dynasty, just
      as I am a system. He is able to annihilate us; therefore, I say, Death to
      the Guise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather have a peaceful victory, won by time and reason,&rdquo; said de
      Beze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; exclaimed Calvin, dashing his chair to the ground, &ldquo;reason! Are
      you mad? Can reason achieve conquests? You know nothing of men, you who
      deal with them, idiot! The thing that injures my doctrine, you triple
      fool! is the reason that is in it. By the lightning of Saul, by the sword
      of Vengeance, thou pumpkin-head, do you not see the vigor given to my
      Reform by the massacre at Amboise? Ideas never grow till they are watered
      with blood. The slaying of the Duc de Guise will lead to a horrible
      persecution, and I pray for it with all my might. Our reverses are
      preferable to success. The Reformation has an object to gain in being
      attacked; do you hear me, dolt? It cannot hurt us to be defeated, whereas
      Catholicism is at an end if we should win but a single battle. Ha! what
      are my lieutenants?&mdash;rags, wet rags instead of men! white-haired
      cravens! baptized apes! O God, grant me ten years more of life! If I die
      too soon the cause of true religion is lost in the hands of such boobies!
      You are as great a fool as Antoine de Navarre! Out of my sight! Leave me;
      I want a better negotiator than you! You are an ass, a popinjay, a poet!
      Go and make your elegies and your acrostics, you trifler! Hence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pains of his body were absolutely overcome by the fire of his anger;
      even the gout subsided under this horrible excitement of his mind.
      Calvin&rsquo;s face flushed purple, like the sky before a storm. His vast brow
      shone. His eyes flamed. He was no longer himself. He gave way utterly to
      the species of epileptic motion, full of passion, which was common with
      him. But in the very midst of it he was struck by the attitude of the two
      witnesses; then, as he caught the words of Chaudieu saying to de Beze,
      &ldquo;The Burning Bush!&rdquo; he sat down, was silent, and covered his face with his
      two hands, the knotted veins of which were throbbing in spite of their
      coarse texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes later, still shaken by this storm raised within him by the
      continence of his life, he said in a voice of emotion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sins, which are many, cost me less trouble to subdue, than my
      impatience. Oh, savage beast! shall I never vanquish you?&rdquo; he cried,
      beating his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear master,&rdquo; said de Beze, in a tender voice, taking Calvin&rsquo;s hand
      and kissing it, &ldquo;Jupiter thunders, but he knows how to smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calvin looked at his disciple with a softened eye and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand me, my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that the pastors of peoples bear great burdens,&rdquo; replied
      Theodore. &ldquo;You have a world upon your shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have three martyrs,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, whom the master&rsquo;s outburst had
      rendered thoughtful, &ldquo;on whom we can rely. Stuart, who killed Minard, is
      at liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Calvin, gently, smiling after the manner of great
      men who bring fair weather into their faces as though they were ashamed of
      the previous storm. &ldquo;I know human nature; a man may kill one president,
      but not two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it absolutely necessary?&rdquo; asked de Beze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again!&rdquo; exclaimed Calvin, his nostrils swelling. &ldquo;Come, leave me, you
      will drive me to fury. Take my decision to the queen. You, Chaudieu, go
      your way, and hold your flock together in Paris. God guide you! Dinah,
      light my friends to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not permit me to embrace you?&rdquo; said Theodore, much moved. &ldquo;Who
      knows what may happen to us on the morrow? We may be seized in spite of
      our safe-conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you want to spare them!&rdquo; cried Calvin, embracing de Beze. Then he
      took Chaudieu&rsquo;s hand and said: &ldquo;Above all, no Huguenots, no Reformers, but
      <i>Calvinists</i>! Use no term but Calvinism. Alas! this is not ambition,
      for I am dying,&mdash;but it is necessary to destroy the whole of Luther,
      even to the name of Lutheran and Lutheranism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! man divine,&rdquo; cried Chaudieu, &ldquo;you well deserve such honors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maintain the uniformity of the doctrine; let no one henceforth change or
      remark it. We are lost if new sects issue from our bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We will here anticipate the events on which this Study is based, and close
      the history of Theodore de Beze, who went to Paris with Chaudieu. It is to
      be remarked that Poltrot, who fired at the Duc de Guise fifteen months
      later, confessed under torture that he had been urged to the crime by
      Theodore de Beze; though he retracted that avowal during subsequent
      tortures; so that Bossuet, after weighing all historical considerations,
      felt obliged to acquit Beze of instigating the crime. Since Bossuet&rsquo;s
      time, however, an apparently futile dissertation, apropos of a celebrated
      song, has led a compiler of the eighteenth century to prove that the
      verses on the death of the Duc de Guise, sung by the Huguenots from one
      end of France to the other, was the work of Theodore de Beze; and it is
      also proved that the famous song on the burial of Marlborough was a
      plagiarism on it.[*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] One of the most remarkable instances of the transmission
     of songs is that of Marlborough. Written in the first
     instance by a Huguenot on the death of the Duc de Guise in
     1563, it was preserved in the French army, and appears to
     have been sung with variations, suppressions, and additions
     at the death of all generals of importance. When the
     intestine wars were over the song followed the soldiers into
     civil life. It was never forgotten (though the habit of
     singing it may have lessened), and in 1781, sixty years
     after the death of Marlborough, the wet-nurse of the Dauphin
     was heard to sing it as she suckled her nursling. When and
     why the name of the Duke of Marlborough was substituted for
     that of the Duc de Guise has never been ascertained. See
     &ldquo;Chansons Populaires,&rdquo; par Charles Nisard: Paris, Dentu,
     1867.&mdash;Tr.

    <h2>
      XIV. CATHERINE IN POWER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day on which Theodore de Beze and Chaudieu arrived in Paris, the court
      returned from Rheims, where Charles IX. was crowned. This ceremony, which
      Catherine made magnificent with splendid fetes, enabled her to gather
      about her the leaders of the various parties. Having studied all interests
      and all factions, she found herself with two alternatives from which to
      choose; either to rally them all to the throne, or to pit them one against
      the other. The Connetable de Montmorency, supremely Catholic, whose
      nephew, the Prince de Conde, was leader of the Reformers, and whose sons
      were inclined to the new religion, blamed the alliance of the queen-mother
      with the Reformation. The Guises, on their side, were endeavoring to gain
      over Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre, a weak prince; a manoeuvre which
      his wife, Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, instructed by de Beze, allowed to succeed. The
      difficulties were plain to Catherine, whose dawning power needed a period
      of tranquillity. She therefore impatiently awaited Calvin&rsquo;s reply to the
      message which the Prince de Conde, the king of Navarre, Coligny,
      d&rsquo;Andelot, and the Cardinal de Chatillon had sent him through de Beze and
      Chaudieu. Meantime, however, she was faithful to her promises as to the
      Prince de Conde. The chancellor put an end to the proceedings in which
      Christophe was involved by referring the affair to the Parliament of
      Paris, which at once set aside the judgment of the committee, declaring it
      without power to try a prince of the blood. The Parliament then reopened
      the trial, at the request of the Guises and the queen-mother. Lasagne&rsquo;s
      papers had already been given to Catherine, who burned them. The giving up
      of these papers was a first pledge, uselessly made by the Guises to the
      queen-mother. The Parliament, no longer able to take cognizance of those
      decisive proofs, reinstated the prince in all his rights, property, and
      honors. Christophe, released during the tumult at Orleans on the death of
      the king, was acquitted in the first instance, and appointed, in
      compensation for his sufferings, solicitor to the Parliament, at the
      request of his godfather Monsieur de Thou.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Triumvirate, that coming coalition of self-interests threatened by
      Catherine&rsquo;s first acts, was now forming itself under her very eyes. Just
      as in chemistry antagonistic substances separate at the first shock which
      jars their enforced union, so in politics the alliance of opposing
      interests never lasts. Catherine thoroughly understood that sooner or
      later she should return to the Guises and combine with them and the
      Connetable to do battle against the Huguenots. The proposed &ldquo;colloquy&rdquo;
       which tempted the vanity of the orators of all parties, and offered an
      imposing spectacle to succeed that of the coronation and enliven the
      bloody ground of a religious war which, in point of fact, had already
      begun, was as futile in the eyes of the Duc de Guise as in those of
      Catherine. The Catholics would, in one sense be worsted; for the
      Huguenots, under pretext of conferring, would be able to proclaim their
      doctrine, with the sanction of the king and his mother, to the ears of all
      France. The Cardinal de Lorraine, flattered by Catherine into the idea of
      destroying the heresy by the eloquence of the Church, persuaded his
      brother to consent; and thus the queen obtained what was all-essential to
      her, six months of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight event, occurring at this time, came near compromising the power
      which Catherine had so painfully built up. The following scene, preserved
      in history, took place, on the very day the envoys returned from Geneva,
      in the hotel de Coligny near the Louvre. At his coronation, Charles IX.,
      who was greatly attached to his tutor Amyot, appointed him grand-almoner
      of France. This affection was shared by his brother the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou,
      afterwards Henri III., another of Anjou&rsquo;s pupils. Catherine heard the news
      of this appointment from the two Gondis during the journey from Rheims to
      Paris. She had counted on that office in the gift of the Crown to gain a
      supporter in the Church with whom to oppose the Cardinal de Lorraine. Her
      choice had fallen on the Cardinal de Tournon, in whom she expected to
      find, as in l&rsquo;Hopital, another <i>crutch</i>&mdash;the word is her own. As
      soon as she reached the Louvre she sent for the tutor, and her anger was
      such, on seeing the disaster to her policy caused by the ambition of this
      son of a shoemaker, that she was betrayed into using the following
      extraordinary language, which several memoirs of the day have handed down
      to us:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;am I, who compel the Guises, the Colignys, the
      Connetables, the house of Navarre, the Prince de Conde, to serve my ends,
      am I to be opposed by a priestling like you who are not satisfied to be
      bishop of Auxerre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amyot excused himself. He assured the queen that he had asked nothing; the
      king of his own will had given him the office of which he, the son of a
      poor tailor, felt himself quite unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured, <i>maitre</i>,&rdquo; replied Catherine (that being the name which
      the two kings, Charles IX. and Henri III., gave to the great writer) &ldquo;that
      you will not stand on your feet twenty-four hours hence, unless you make
      your pupil change his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between the death thus threatened and the resignation of the highest
      ecclesiastical office in the gift of the crown, the son of the shoemaker,
      who had lately become extremely eager after honors, and may even have
      coveted a cardinal&rsquo;s hat, thought it prudent to temporize. He left the
      court and hid himself in the abbey of Saint-Germain. When Charles IX. did
      not see him at his first dinner, he asked where he was. Some Guisard
      doubtless told him of what had occurred between Amyot and the
      queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been forced to disappear because I made him grand-almoner?&rdquo; cried
      the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thereupon rushed to his mother in the violent wrath of angry children
      when their caprices are opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said on entering, &ldquo;did I not kindly sign the letter you asked
      me to send to Parliament, by means of which you govern my kingdom? Did you
      not promise that if I did so my will should be yours? And here, the first
      favor that I wish to bestow excites your jealousy! The chancellor talks of
      declaring my majority at fourteen, three years from now, and you wish to
      treat me as a child. By God, I will be king, and a king as my father and
      grandfather were kings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone and manner in which these words were said gave Catherine a
      revelation of her son&rsquo;s true character; it was like a blow in the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks to me thus, he whom I made a king!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
       she said aloud, &ldquo;the office of a king, in times like these, is a very
      difficult one; you do not yet know the shrewd men with whom you have to
      deal. You will never have a safer and more sincere friend than your
      mother, or better servants than those who have been so long attached to
      her person, without whose services you might perhaps not even exist
      to-day. The Guises want both your life and your throne, be sure of that.
      If they could sew me into a sack and fling me into the river,&rdquo; she said,
      pointing to the Seine, &ldquo;it would be done to-night. They know that I am a
      lioness defending her young, and that I alone prevent their daring hands
      from seizing your crown. To whom&mdash;to whose party does your tutor
      belong? Who are his allies? What authority has he? What services can he do
      you? What weight do his words carry? Instead of finding a prop to sustain
      your power, you have cut the ground from under it. The Cardinal de
      Lorraine is a living threat to you; he plays the king; he keeps his hat on
      his head before the princes of the blood; it was urgently necessary to
      invest another cardinal with powers greater than his own. But what have
      you done? Is Amyot, that shoemaker, fit only to tie the ribbons of his
      shoes, is he capable of making head against the Guise ambition? However,
      you love Amyot, you have appointed him; your will must now be done,
      monsieur. But before you make such gifts again, I pray you to consult me
      in affectionate good faith. Listen to reasons of state; and your own good
      sense as a child may perhaps agree with my old experience, when you really
      understand the difficulties that lie before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can have my master back again?&rdquo; cried the king, not listening to
      his mother&rsquo;s words, which he considered to be mere reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you shall have him,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But it is not here, nor that
      brutal Cypierre who will teach you how to reign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you to do so, my dear mother,&rdquo; said the boy, mollified by his
      victory and relaxing the surly and threatening look stamped by nature upon
      his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine sent Gondi to recall the new grand-almoner. When the Italian
      discovered the place of Amyot&rsquo;s retreat, and the bishop heard that the
      courtier was sent by the queen, he was seized with terror and refused to
      leave the abbey. In this extremity Catherine was obliged to write to him
      herself, in such terms that he returned to Paris and received from her own
      lips the assurance of her protection,&mdash;on condition, however, that he
      would blindly promote her wishes with Charles IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little domestic tempest over, the queen, now re-established in the
      Louvre after an absence of more than a year, held council with her closest
      friends as to the proper conduct to pursue with the young king whom
      Cypierre had complimented on his firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is best to be done?&rdquo; she said to the two Gondis, Ruggiero, Birago,
      and Chiverni who had lately become governor and chancellor to the Duc
      d&rsquo;Anjou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before all else,&rdquo; replied Birago, &ldquo;get rid of Cypierre. He is not a
      courtier; he will never accommodate himself to your ideas, and will think
      he does his duty in thwarting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom can I trust?&rdquo; cried the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of us,&rdquo; said Birago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor!&rdquo; exclaimed Gondi, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you to make the king as
      docile as the king of Navarre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You allowed the late king to perish to save your other children,&rdquo; said
      Albert de Gondi. &ldquo;Do, then, as the great signors of Constantinople do,&mdash;divert
      the anger and amuse the caprices of the present king. He loves art and
      poetry and hunting, also a little girl he saw at Orleans; <i>there&rsquo;s</i>
      occupation enough for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you really be the king&rsquo;s governor?&rdquo; said Catherine to the ablest of
      the Gondis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you will give me the necessary authority; you may even be obliged
      to make me marshal of France and a duke. Cypierre is altogether too small
      a man to hold the office. In future, the governor of a king of France
      should be of some great dignity, like that of duke and marshal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said Birago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poet and huntsman,&rdquo; said Catherine in a dreamy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will hunt and make love!&rdquo; cried Gondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; remarked Chiverni, &ldquo;you are sure of Amyot, who will always
      fear poison in case of disobedience; so that you and he and Gondi can hold
      the king in leading-strings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amyot has deeply offended me,&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know what he owes to you; if he did know, you would be in
      danger,&rdquo; replied Birago, gravely, emphasizing his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, it is agreed,&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, on whom Birago&rsquo;s reply made a
      powerful impression, &ldquo;that you, Gondi, are to be the king&rsquo;s governor. My
      son must consent to do for one of my friends a favor equal to the one I
      have just permitted for his knave of a bishop. That fool has lost the hat;
      for never, as long as I live, will I consent that the Pope shall give it
      to him! How strong we might have been with Cardinal de Tournon! What a
      trio with Tournon for grand-almoner, and l&rsquo;Hopital, and de Thou! As for
      the burghers of Paris, I intend to make my son cajole them; we will get a
      support there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Albert de Gondi became a marshal of France and was created
      Duc de Retz and governor of the king a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when this little private council ended, Cardinal de Tournon
      announced to the queen the arrival of the emissaries sent to Calvin.
      Admiral Coligny accompanied the party in order that his presence might
      ensure them due respect at the Louvre. The queen gathered the formidable
      phalanx of her maids of honor about her, and passed into the reception
      hall, built by her husband, which no longer exists in the Louvre of
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period of which we write the staircase of the Louvre occupied the
      clock tower. Catherine&rsquo;s apartments were in the old buildings which still
      exist in the court of the Musee. The present staircase of the museum was
      built in what was formerly the <i>salle des ballets</i>. The ballet of
      those days was a sort of dramatic entertainment performed by the whole
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revolutionary passions gave rise to a most laughable error about Charles
      IX., in connection with the Louvre. During the Revolution hostile opinions
      as to this king, whose real character was masked, made a monster of him.
      Joseph Cheniers tragedy was written under the influence of certain words
      scratched on the window of the projecting wing of the Louvre, looking
      toward the quay. The words were as follows: &ldquo;It was from this window that
      Charles IX., of execrable memory, fired upon French citizens.&rdquo; It is well
      to inform future historians and all sensible persons that this portion of
      the Louvre&mdash;called to-day the old Louvre&mdash;which projects upon
      the quay and is connected with the Louvre by the room called the Apollo
      gallery (while the great halls of the Museum connect the Louvre with the
      Tuileries) did not exist in the time of Charles IX. The greater part of
      the space where the frontage on the quay now stands, and where the Garden
      of the Infanta is laid out, was then occupied by the hotel de Bourbon,
      which belonged to and was the residence of the house of Navarre. It was
      absolutely impossible, therefore, for Charles IX. to fire from the Louvre
      of Henri II. upon a boat full of Huguenots crossing the river, although <i>at
      the present time</i> the Seine can be seen from its windows. Even if
      learned men and libraries did not possess maps of the Louvre made in the
      time of Charles IX., on which its then position is clearly indicated, the
      building itself refutes the error. All the kings who co-operated in the
      work of erecting this enormous mass of buildings never failed to put their
      initials or some special monogram on the parts they had severally built.
      Now the part we speak of, the venerable and now blackened wing of the
      Louvre, projecting on the quay and overlooking the garden of the Infanta,
      bears the monograms of Henri III. and Henri IV., which are totally
      different from that of Henri II., who invariably joined his H to the two
      C&rsquo;s of Catherine, forming a D,&mdash;which, by the bye, has constantly
      deceived superficial persons into fancying that the king put the initial
      of his mistress, Diane, on great public buildings. Henri IV. united the
      Louvre with his own hotel de Bourbon, its garden and dependencies. He was
      the first to think of connecting Catherine de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s palace of the
      Tuileries with the Louvre by his unfinished galleries, the precious
      sculptures of which have been so cruelly neglected. Even if the map of
      Paris, and the monograms of Henri III. and Henri IV. did not exist, the
      difference of architecture is refutation enough to the calumny. The
      vermiculated stone copings of the hotel de la Force mark the transition
      between what is called the architecture of the Renaissance and that of
      Henri III., Henri IV., and Louis XIII. This archaeological digression
      (continuing the sketches of old Paris with which we began this history)
      enables us to picture to our minds the then appearance of this other
      corner of the old city, of which nothing now remains but Henri IV.&lsquo;s
      addition to the Louvre, with its admirable bas-reliefs, now being rapidly
      annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the court heard that the queen was about to give an audience to
      Theodore de Beze and Chaudieu, presented by Admiral Coligny, all the
      courtiers who had the right of entrance to the reception hall, hastened
      thither to witness the interview. It was about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening;
      Coligny had just supped, and was using a toothpick as he came up the
      staircase of the Louvre between the two Reformers. The practice of using a
      toothpick was so inveterate a habit with the admiral that he was seen to
      do it on the battle-field while planning a retreat. &ldquo;Distrust the
      admiral&rsquo;s toothpick, the <i>No</i> of the Connetable, and Catherine&rsquo;s <i>Yes</i>,&rdquo;
       was a court proverb of that day. After the Saint-Bartholomew the populace
      made a horrible jest on the body of Coligny, which hung for three days at
      Montfaucon, by putting a grotesque toothpick into his mouth. History has
      recorded this atrocious levity. So petty an act done in the midst of that
      great catastrophe pictures the Parisian populace, which deserves the
      sarcastic jibe of Boileau: &ldquo;Frenchmen, born <i>malin</i>, created the
      guillotine.&rdquo; The Parisian of all time cracks jokes and makes lampoons
      before, during, and after the most horrible revolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore de Beze wore the dress of a courtier, black silk stockings, low
      shoes with straps across the instep, tight breeches, a black silk doublet
      with slashed sleeves, and a small black velvet mantle, over which lay an
      elegant white fluted ruff. His beard was trimmed to a moustache and <i>virgule</i>
      (now called imperial) and he carried a sword at his side and a cane in his
      hand. Whosoever knows the galleries of Versailles or the collections of
      Odieuvre, knows also his round, almost jovial face and lively eyes,
      surmounted by the broad forehead which characterized the writers and poets
      of that day. De Beze had, what served him admirably, an agreeable air and
      manner. In this he was a great contrast to Coligny, of austere
      countenance, and to the sour, bilious Chaudieu, who chose to wear on this
      occasion the robe and bands of a Calvinist minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenes that happen in our day in the Chamber of Deputies, and which,
      no doubt, happened in the Convention, will give an idea of how, at this
      court, at this epoch, these men, who six months later were to fight to the
      death in a war without quarter, could meet and talk to each other with
      courtesy and even laughter. Birago, who was coldly to advise the
      Saint-Bartholomew, and Cardinal de Lorraine, who charged his servant Besme
      &ldquo;not to miss the admiral,&rdquo; now advanced to meet Coligny; Birago saying,
      with a smile:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear admiral, so you have really taken upon yourself to present
      these gentlemen from Geneva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will call it a crime in <i>me</i>,&rdquo; replied the admiral,
      jesting, &ldquo;whereas if you had done it yourself you would make a merit of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that the Sieur Calvin is very ill,&rdquo; remarked the Cardinal de
      Lorraine to Theodore de Beze. &ldquo;I hope no one suspects us of giving him his
      broth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monseigneur; it would be too great a risk,&rdquo; replied de Beze,
      maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duc de Guise, who was watching Chaudieu, looked fixedly at his brother
      and at Birago, who were both taken aback by de Beze&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; remarked the cardinal, &ldquo;heretics are not diplomatic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To avoid embarrassment, the queen, who was announced at this moment, had
      arranged to remain standing during the audience. She began by speaking to
      the Connetable, who had previously remonstrated with her vehemently on the
      scandal of receiving messengers from Calvin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear Connetable,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I receive them without
      ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the admiral, approaching the queen, &ldquo;these are two teachers
      of the new religion, who have come to an understanding with Calvin, and
      who have his instructions as to a conference in which the churches of
      France may be able to settle their differences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Monsieur de Beze, to whom my wife is much attached,&rdquo; said the
      king of Navarre, coming forward and taking de Beze by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Chaudieu,&rdquo; said the Prince de Conde. &ldquo;<i>My friend</i> the
      Duc de Guise knows the soldier,&rdquo; he added, looking at Le Balafre, &ldquo;perhaps
      he will now like to know the minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gasconade made the whole court laugh, even Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; replied the Duc de Guise, &ldquo;I am enchanted to see a <i>gars</i>
      who knows so well how to choose his men and to employ them in their right
      sphere. One of your agents,&rdquo; he said to Chaudieu, &ldquo;actually endured the
      extraordinary question without dying and without confessing a single
      thing. I call myself brave; but I don&rsquo;t know that I could have endured it
      as he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; muttered Ambroise, &ldquo;you did not say a word when I pulled the
      javelin out of your face at Calais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, standing at the centre of a semicircle of the courtiers and
      maids of honor, kept silence. She was observing the two Reformers, trying
      to penetrate their minds as, with the shrewd, intelligent glance of her
      black eyes, she studied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One seems to be the scabbard, the other the blade,&rdquo; whispered Albert de
      Gondi in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Catherine at last, unable to restrain a smile,
      &ldquo;has your master given you permission to unite in a public conference, at
      which you will be converted by the arguments of the Fathers of the Church
      who are the glory of our State?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no master but the Lord,&rdquo; said Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you will allow some little authority to the king of France?&rdquo;
       said Catherine, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And much to the queen,&rdquo; said de Beze, bowing low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find,&rdquo; continued the queen, &ldquo;that our most submissive subjects
      are heretics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; cried Coligny, &ldquo;we will indeed endeavor to make you a noble
      and peaceful kingdom! Europe has profited, alas! by our internal
      divisions. For the last fifty years she has had the advantage of one-half
      of the French people being against the other half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we here to sing anthems to the glory of heretics,&rdquo; said the
      Connetable, brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but to bring them to repentance,&rdquo; whispered the Cardinal de Lorraine
      in his ear; &ldquo;we want to coax them by a little sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I should have done under the late king?&rdquo; said the
      Connetable, angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have called in the provost and hung those two
      knaves, then and there, on the gallows of the Louvre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, who are the learned men whom you have selected as our
      opponents?&rdquo; inquired the queen, imposing silence on the Connetable by a
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duplessis-Mornay and Theodore de Beze will speak on our side,&rdquo; replied
      Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The court will doubtless go to Saint-Germain, and as it would be improper
      that this <i>colloquy</i> should take place in a royal residence, we will
      have it in the little town of Poissy,&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we be safe there, madame?&rdquo; asked Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the queen, with a sort of naivete, &ldquo;you will surely know how
      to take precautions. The Admiral will arrange all that with my cousins the
      Guises and de Montmorency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take them!&rdquo; cried the Connetable, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you contrive to give such strength of character to your converts?&rdquo;
       said the queen, leading Chaudieu apart. &ldquo;The son of my furrier was
      actually sublime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have faith,&rdquo; replied Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the hall presented a scene of animated groups, all
      discussing the question of the proposed assembly, to which the few words
      said by the queen had already given the name of the &ldquo;Colloquy of Poissy.&rdquo;
       Catherine glanced at Chaudieu and was able to say to him unheard:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a new faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame, if you were not blinded by your alliance with the court of
      Rome, you would see that we are returning to the true doctrines of Jesus
      Christ, who, recognizing the equality of souls, bestows upon all men equal
      rights on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think yourself the equal of Calvin?&rdquo; asked the queen, shrewdly.
      &ldquo;No, no; we are equals only in church. What! would you unbind the tie of
      the people to the throne?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Then you are not only heretics, you
      are revolutionists,&mdash;rebels against obedience to the king as you are
      against that to the Pope!&rdquo; So saying, she left Chaudieu abruptly and
      returned to Theodore de Beze. &ldquo;I count on you, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
      conduct this colloquy in good faith. Take all the time you need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had supposed,&rdquo; said Chaudieu to the Prince de Conde, the King of
      Navarre, and Admiral Coligny, as they left the hall, &ldquo;that a great State
      matter would be treated more seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we know very well what you want,&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince de Conde,
      exchanging a sly look with Theodore de Beze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince now left his adherents to attend a rendezvous. This great
      leader of a party was also one of the most favored gallants of the court.
      The two choice beauties of that day were even then striving with such
      desperate eagerness for his affections that one of them, the Marechale de
      Saint-Andre, the wife of the future triumvir, gave him her beautiful
      estate of Saint-Valery, hoping to win him away from the Duchesse de Guise,
      the wife of the man who had tried to take his head on the scaffold. The
      duchess, not being able to detach the Duc de Nemours from Mademoiselle de
      Rohan, fell in love, <i>en attendant</i>, with the leader of the
      Reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a contrast to Geneva!&rdquo; said Chaudieu to Theodore de Beze, as they
      crossed the little bridge of the Louvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people here are certainly gayer than the Genevese. I don&rsquo;t see why
      they should be so treacherous,&rdquo; replied de Beze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To treachery oppose treachery,&rdquo; replied Chaudieu, whispering the words in
      his companion&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I have <i>saints</i> in Paris on whom I can rely,
      and I intend to make Calvin a prophet. Christophe Lecamus shall deliver us
      from our most dangerous enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen-mother, for whom the poor devil endured his torture, has
      already, with a high hand, caused him to be appointed solicitor to the
      Parliament; and solicitors make better prosecutors than murderers. Don&rsquo;t
      you remember how Avenelles betrayed the secrets of our first uprising?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Christophe,&rdquo; said Chaudieu, in a positive tone, as he turned to
      leave the envoy from Geneva.

    <h2>
      XV. COMPENSATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after the reception of Calvin&rsquo;s emissaries by the queen, that
      is to say, toward the close of the year (for the year then began at Easter
      and the present calendar was not adopted until later in the reign of
      Charles IX.), Christophe reclined in an easy chair beside the fire in the
      large brown hall, dedicated to family life, that overlooked the river in
      his father&rsquo;s house, where the present drama was begun. His feet rested on
      a stool; his mother and Babette Lallier had just renewed the compresses,
      saturated with a solution brought by Ambroise Pare, who was charged by
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici to take care of the young man. Once restored to his
      family, Christophe became the object of the most devoted care. Babette,
      authorized by her father, came very morning and only left the Lecamus
      household at night. Christophe, the admiration of the apprentices, gave
      rise throughout the quarter to various tales, which invested him with
      mysterious poesy. He had borne the worst torture; the celebrated Ambroise
      Pare was employing all his skill to cure him. What great deed had he done
      to be thus treated? Neither Christophe nor his father said a word on the
      subject. Catherine, then all-powerful, was concerned in their silence as
      well as the Prince de Conde. The constant visits of Pare, now chief
      surgeon of both the king and the house of Guise, whom the queen-mother and
      the Lorrains allowed to treat a youth accused of heresy, strangely
      complicated an affair through which no one saw clearly. Moreover, the
      rector of Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs came several times to visit the son of
      his church-warden, and these visits made the causes of Christophe&rsquo;s
      present condition still more unintelligible to his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old syndic, who had his plan, gave evasive answers to his
      brother-furriers, the merchants of the neighborhood, and to all friends
      who spoke to him of his son: &ldquo;Yes, I am very thankful to have saved him.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
      you know, it won&rsquo;t do to put your finger between the bark and the tree.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My
      son touched fire and came near burning up my house.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They took
      advantage of his youth; we burghers get nothing but shame and evil by
      frequenting the grandees.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This affair decides me to make a lawyer
      of Christophe; the practice of law will teach him to weigh his words and
      his acts.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The young queen, who is now in Scotland, had a great
      deal to do with it; but then, to be sure, my son may have been imprudent.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have had cruel anxieties.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All this may decide me to give up my
      business; I do not wish ever to go to court again.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My son has had
      enough of the Reformation; it has cracked all his joints. If it had not
      been for Ambroise, I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to these ambiguous remarks and to the great discretion of such
      conduct, it was generally averred in the neighborhood that Christophe had
      seen the error of his ways; everybody thought it natural that the old
      syndic should wish to get his son appointed to the Parliament, and the
      rector&rsquo;s visits no longer seemed extraordinary. As the neighbors reflected
      on the old man&rsquo;s anxieties they no longer thought, as they would otherwise
      have done, that his ambition was inordinate. The young lawyer, who had
      lain helpless for months on the bed which his family made up for him in
      the old hall, was now, for the last week, able to rise and move about by
      the aid of crutches. Babette&rsquo;s love and his mother&rsquo;s tenderness had deeply
      touched his heart; and they, while they had him helpless in their hands,
      lectured him severely on religion. President de Thou paid his godson a
      visit during which he showed himself most fatherly. Christophe, being now
      a solicitor of the Parliament, must of course, he said, be Catholic; his
      oath would bind him to that; and the president, who assumed not to doubt
      of his godson&rsquo;s orthodoxy, ended his remarks by saying with great
      earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, you have been cruelly tried. I am myself ignorant of the reasons
      which made the Messieurs de Guise treat you thus; but I advise you in
      future to live peacefully, without entering into the troubles of the
      times; for the favor of the king and queen will not be shown to the makers
      of revolt. You are not important enough to play fast and loose with the
      king as the Guises do. If you wish to be some day counsellor to the
      Parliament remember that you cannot obtain that noble office unless by a
      real and serious attachment to the royal cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, neither President de Thou&rsquo;s visit, nor the seductions of
      Babette, nor the urgency of his mother, were sufficient to shake the
      constancy of the martyr of the Reformation. Christophe held to his
      religion all the more because he had suffered for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father will never let me marry a heretic,&rdquo; whispered Babette in his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe answered only by tears, which made the young girl silent and
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lecamus maintained his paternal and magisterial dignity; he observed
      his son and said little. The stern old man, after recovering his dear
      Christophe, was dissatisfied with himself; he repented the tenderness he
      had shown for this only son; but he admired him secretly. At no period of
      his life did the syndic pull more wires to reach his ends, for he saw the
      field ripe for the harvest so painfully sown, and he wanted to gather the
      whole of it. Some days before the morning of which we write, he had had,
      being alone with Christophe, a long conversation with him in which he
      endeavored to discover the secret reason of the young man&rsquo;s resistance.
      Christophe, who was not without ambition, betrayed his faith in the Prince
      de Conde. The generous promise of the prince, who, of course, was only
      exercising his profession of prince, remained graven on his heart; little
      did he think that Conde had sent him, mentally, to the devil in Orleans,
      muttering, &ldquo;A Gascon would have understood me better,&rdquo; when Christophe
      called out a touching farewell as the prince passed the window of his
      dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides this sentiment of admiration for the prince, Christophe had
      also conceived a profound reverence for the great queen, who had explained
      to him by a single look the necessity which compelled her to sacrifice
      him; and who during his agony had given him an illimitable promise in a
      single tear. During the silent months of his weakness, as he lay there
      waiting for recovery, he thought over each event at Blois and at Orleans.
      He weighed, one might almost say in spite of himself, the relative worth
      of these two protections. He floated between the queen and the prince. He
      had certainly served Catherine more than he had served the Reformation,
      and in a young man both heart and mind would naturally incline toward the
      queen; less because she was a queen than because she was a woman. Under
      such circumstances a man will always hope more from a woman than from a
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sacrificed myself for her; what will she do for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question Christophe put to himself almost involuntarily as he
      remembered the tone in which she had said the words, <i>Povero mio</i>! It
      is difficult to believe how egotistical a man can become when he lies on a
      bed of sickness. Everything, even the exclusive devotion of which he is
      the object, drives him to think only of himself. By exaggerating in his
      own mind the obligation which the Prince de Conde was under to him he had
      come to expect that some office would be given to him at the court of
      Navarre. Still new to the world of political life, he forgot its
      contending interests and the rapid march of events which control and force
      the hand of all leaders of parties; he forgot it the more because he was
      practically a prisoner in solitary confinement on his bed in that old
      brown room. Each party is, necessarily, ungrateful while the struggle
      lasts; when it triumphs it has too many persons to reward not to be
      ungrateful still. Soldiers submit to this ingratitude; but their leaders
      turn against the new master at whose side they have acted and suffered
      like equals for so long. Christophe, who alone remembered his sufferings,
      felt himself already among the leaders of the Reformation by the fact of
      his martyrdom. His father, that old fox of commerce, so shrewd, so
      perspicacious, ended by divining the secret thought of his son;
      consequently, all his manoeuvres were now based on the natural expectancy
      to which Christophe had yielded himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a fine thing,&rdquo; he had said to Babette, in presence of the
      family a few days before his interview with his son, &ldquo;to be the wife of a
      counsellor of the Parliament? You would be called <i>madame</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crazy, <i>compere</i>,&rdquo; said Lallier. &ldquo;Where would you get ten
      thousand crowns&rsquo; income from landed property, which a counsellor must
      have, according to law; and from whom could you buy the office? No one but
      the queen-mother and regent could help your son into Parliament, and I&rsquo;m
      afraid he&rsquo;s too tainted with the new opinions for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you pay to see your daughter the wife of a counsellor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you want to look into my purse, shrewd-head!&rdquo; said Lallier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counsellor to the Parliament! The words worked powerfully in Christophe&rsquo;s
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime after this conversation, one morning when Christophe was gazing
      at the river and thinking of the scene which began this history, of the
      Prince de Conde, Chaudieu, La Renaudie, of his journey to Blois,&mdash;in
      short, the whole story of his hopes,&mdash;his father came and sat down
      beside him, scarcely concealing a joyful thought beneath a serious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after what passed between you and the leaders of the
      Tumult of Amboise, they owe you enough to make the care of your future
      incumbent on the house of Navarre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued his father, &ldquo;I have asked their permission to buy a
      legal practice for you in the province of Bearn. Our good friend Pare
      undertook to present the letters which I wrote on your behalf to the
      Prince de Conde and the queen of Navarre. Here, read the answer of
      Monsieur de Pibrac, vice-chancellor of Navarre:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To the Sieur Lecamus, <i>syndic of the guild of furriers</i>:

  Monseigneur le Prince de Conde desires me to express his regret
  that he cannot do what you ask for his late companion in the tower
  of Saint-Aignan, whom he perfectly remembers, and to whom,
  meanwhile, he offers the place of gendarme in his company; which
  will put your son in the way of making his mark as a man of
  courage, which he is.

  The queen of Navarre awaits an opportunity to reward the Sieur
  Christophe, and will not fail to take advantage of it.

  Upon which, Monsieur le syndic, we pray God to have you in His
  keeping.

  Pibrac,

  At Nerac.
  Chancellor of Navarre.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerac, Pibrac, crack!&rdquo; cried Babette. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no confidence to be placed
      in Gascons; they think only of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Lecamus looked at his son, smiling scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They propose to put on horseback a poor boy whose knees and ankles were
      shattered for their sakes!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;What a wicked jest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never see you a counsellor of Navarre,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew what Queen Catherine would do for me, if I made a claim
      upon her,&rdquo; said Christophe, cast down by the prince&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made you no promise,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I am certain that <i>she</i>
      will never mock you like these others; she will remember your sufferings.
      Still, how can the queen make a counsellor of the Parliament out of a
      protestant burgher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Christophe has not abjured!&rdquo; cried Babette. &ldquo;He can very well keep
      his private opinions secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince de Conde would be less disdainful of a counsellor of the
      Parliament,&rdquo; said Lallier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what say you, Christophe?&rdquo; urged Babette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are counting without the queen,&rdquo; replied the young lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this rather bitter disillusion, an apprentice brought
      Christophe the following laconic little missive:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Chaudieu wishes to see his son.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come in!&rdquo; cried Christophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my sacred martyr!&rdquo; said the minister, embracing him; &ldquo;have you
      recovered from your sufferings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thanks to Pare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks rather to God, who gave you the strength to endure the torture.
      But what is this I hear? Have you allowed them to make you a solicitor?
      Have you taken the oath of fidelity? Surely you will not recognize that
      prostitute, the Roman, Catholic, and apostolic Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ought we not to leave fathers and mothers and wives and children,
      all, all, for the sacred cause of Calvinism; nay, must we not suffer all
      things? Ah! Christophe, Calvin, the great Calvin, the whole party, the
      whole world, the Future counts upon your courage and the grandeur of your
      soul. We want your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a remarkable fact in the mind of man that the most devoted spirits,
      even while devoting themselves, build romantic hopes upon their perilous
      enterprises. When the prince, the soldier, and the minister had asked
      Christophe, under the bridge, to convey to Catherine the treaty which, if
      discovered, would in all probability cost him his life, the lad had relied
      on his nerve, upon chance, upon the powers of his mind, and confident in
      such hopes he bravely, nay, audaciously put himself between those terrible
      adversaries, the Guises and Catherine. During the torture he still kept
      saying to himself: &ldquo;I shall come out of it! it is only pain!&rdquo; But when
      this second and brutal demand, &ldquo;Die, we want your life,&rdquo; was made upon a
      boy who was still almost helpless, scarcely recovered from his late
      torture, and clinging all the more to life because he had just seen death
      so near, it was impossible for him to launch into further illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe answered quietly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fire a pistol courageously, as Stuart did on Minard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duc de Guise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vengeance. Have you forgotten the hundred gentlemen massacred on the
      scaffold at Amboise? A child who saw that butchery, the little d&rsquo;Aubigne
      cried out, &lsquo;They have slaughtered France!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should receive the blows of others and give none; that is the
      religion of the gospel,&rdquo; said Christophe. &ldquo;If you imitate the Catholics in
      their cruelty, of what good is it to reform the Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Christophe, they have made you a lawyer, and now you argue!&rdquo; said
      Chaudieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;but parties are ungrateful; and
      you will be, both you and yours, nothing more than puppets of the
      Bourbons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christophe, if you could hear Calvin, you would know how we wear them
      like gloves! The Bourbons are the gloves, we are the hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; said Christophe, giving Chaudieu Pibrac&rsquo;s letter containing
      the answer of the Prince de Conde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my son; you are ambitious, you can no longer make the sacrifice of
      yourself!&mdash;I pity you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those fine words Chaudieu turned and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days after that scene, the Lallier family and the Lecamus family were
      gathered together in honor of the formal betrothal of Christophe and
      Babette, in the old brown hall, from which Christophe&rsquo;s bed had been
      removed; for he was now able to drag himself about and even mount the
      stairs without his crutches. It was nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening and the
      company were awaiting Ambroise Pare. The family notary sat before a table
      on which lay various contracts. The furrier was selling his house and
      business to his head-clerk, who was to pay down forty thousand francs for
      the house and then mortgage it as security for the payment of the goods,
      for which, however, he paid twenty thousand francs on account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus was also buying for his son a magnificent stone house, built by
      Philibert de l&rsquo;Orme in the rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs, which he gave to
      Christophe as a marriage portion. He also took two hundred thousand francs
      from his own fortune, and Lallier gave as much more, for the purchase of a
      fine seignorial manor in Picardy, the price of which was five hundred
      thousand francs. As this manor was a tenure from the Crown it was
      necessary to obtain letters-patent (called <i>rescriptions</i>) granted by
      the king, and also to make payment to the Crown of considerable feudal
      dues. The marriage had been postponed until this royal favor was obtained.
      Though the burghers of Paris had lately acquired the right to purchase
      manors, the wisdom of the privy council had been exercised in putting
      certain restrictions on the sale of those estates which were dependencies
      of the Crown; and the one which old Lecamus had had in his eye for the
      last dozen years was among them. Ambroise was pledged to bring the royal
      ordinance that evening; and the old furrier went and came from the hall to
      the door in a state of impatience which showed how great his
      long-repressed ambition had been. Ambroise at last appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My old friend!&rdquo; cried the surgeon, in an agitated manner, with a glance
      at the supper table, &ldquo;let me see your linen. Good. Oh! you must have wax
      candles. Quick, quick! get out your best things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? what is it all about?&rdquo; asked the rector of Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen-mother and the young king are coming to sup with you,&rdquo; replied
      the surgeon. &ldquo;They are only waiting for an old counsellor who agreed to
      sell his place to Christophe, and with whom Monsieur de Thou has concluded
      a bargain. Don&rsquo;t appear to know anything; I have escaped from the Louvre
      to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a second the whole family were astir; Christophe&rsquo;s mother and Babette&rsquo;s
      aunt bustled about with the celerity of housekeepers suddenly surprised.
      But in spite of the apparent confusion into which the news had thrown the
      entire family, the precautions were promptly made, with an activity that
      was nothing short of marvellous. Christophe, amazed and confounded by such
      a favor, was speechless, gazing mechanically at what went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen and king here in our house!&rdquo; said the old mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen!&rdquo; repeated Babette. &ldquo;What must we say and do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In less than an hour all was changed; the hall was decorated; the
      supper-table sparkled. Presently the noise of horses sounded in the
      street. The light of torches carried by the horsemen of the escort brought
      all the burghers of the neighborhood to their windows. The noise soon
      subsided and the escort rode away, leaving the queen-mother and her son,
      King Charles IX., Charles de Gondi, now Grand-master of the wardrobe and
      governor of the king, Monsieur de Thou, Pinard, secretary of State, the
      old counsellor, and two pages, under the arcade before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My worthy people,&rdquo; said the queen as she entered, &ldquo;the king, my son, and
      I have come to sign the marriage-contract of the son of my furrier,&mdash;but
      only on condition that he remains a Catholic. A man must be a Catholic to
      enter Parliament; he must be a Catholic to own land which derives from the
      Crown; he must be a Catholic if he would sit at the king&rsquo;s table. That is
      so, is it not, Pinard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary of State entered and showed the letters-patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are not all Catholics,&rdquo; said the little king, &ldquo;Pinard will throw
      those papers into the fire. But we are all Catholics here, I think,&rdquo; he
      continued, casting his somewhat haughty eyes over the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied Christophe, bending his injured knees with
      difficulty, and kissing the hand which the king held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Catherine stretched out her hand to Christophe and, raising him
      hastily, drew him aside into a corner, saying in a low voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! my lad, no evasions here. Are you playing above-board now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; he answered, won by the dazzling reward and the honor done
      him by the grateful queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Monsieur Lecamus, the king, my son, and I permit you to
      purchase the office of the goodman Groslay, counsellor of the Parliament,
      here present. Young man, you will follow, I hope, in the steps of your
      predecessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Thou advanced and said: &ldquo;I will answer for him, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; draw up the deed, notary,&rdquo; said Pinard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inasmuch as the king our master does us the favor to sign my daughter&rsquo;s
      marriage contract,&rdquo; cried Lallier, &ldquo;I will pay the whole price of the
      manor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies may sit down,&rdquo; said the young king, graciously: &ldquo;As a wedding
      present to the bride I remit, with my mother&rsquo;s consent, all my dues and
      rights in the manor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Lecamus and Lallier fell on their knees and kissed the king&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mordieu</i>! sire, what quantities of money these burghers have!&rdquo;
       whispered de Gondi in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young king laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As their Highnesses are so kind,&rdquo; said old Lecamus, &ldquo;will they permit me
      to present to them my successor, and ask them to continue to him the royal
      patent of furrier to their Majesties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see him,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lecamus led forward his successor, who was livid with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my mother consents, we will now sit down to table,&rdquo; said the little
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lecamus had bethought himself of presenting to the king a silver
      goblet which he had bought of Benvenuto Cellini when the latter stayed in
      Paris at the hotel de Nesle. This treasure of art had cost the furrier no
      less than two thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear mother, see this beautiful work!&rdquo; cried the young king,
      lifting the goblet by its stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was made in Florence,&rdquo; replied Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, madame,&rdquo; said Lecamus, &ldquo;it was made in Paris by a Florentine.
      All that is made in Florence would belong to your Majesty; that which is
      made in France is the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept it, my good man,&rdquo; cried Charles IX.; &ldquo;and it shall henceforth be
      my particular drinking cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beautiful enough,&rdquo; said the queen, examining the masterpiece, &ldquo;to
      be included among the crown-jewels. Well, Maitre Ambroise,&rdquo; she whispered
      in the surgeon&rsquo;s ear, with a glance at Christophe, &ldquo;have you taken good
      care of him? Will he walk again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will run,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, smiling. &ldquo;Ah! you have cleverly made
      him a renegade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the queen, with the levity for which she has been blamed,
      though it was only on the surface, &ldquo;the Church won&rsquo;t stand still for want
      of one monk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supper was gay; the queen thought Babette pretty, and, in the regal
      manner which was natural to her, she slipped upon the girl&rsquo;s finger a
      diamond ring which compensated in value for the goblet bestowed upon the
      king. Charles IX., who afterwards became rather too fond of these
      invasions of burgher homes, supped with a good appetite. Then, at a word
      from his new governor (who, it is said, was instructed to make him forget
      the virtuous teachings of Cypierre), he obliged all the men present to
      drink so deeply that the queen, observing that the gaiety was about to
      become too noisy, rose to leave the room. As she rose, Christophe, his
      father, and the two women took torches and accompanied her to the
      shop-door. There Christophe ventured to touch the queen&rsquo;s wide sleeve and
      to make her a sign that he had something to say. Catherine stopped, made a
      gesture to the father and the two women to leave her, and said, turning to
      Christophe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may serve you to know, madame,&rdquo; replied Christophe, whispering in her
      ear, &ldquo;that the Duc de Guise is being followed by assassins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a loyal subject,&rdquo; said Catherine, smiling, &ldquo;and I shall never
      forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out to him her hand, so celebrated for its beauty, first
      ungloving it, which was indeed a mark of favor,&mdash;so much so that
      Christophe, then and there, became altogether royalist as he kissed that
      adorable hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they mean to rid me of that bully without my having a finger in it,&rdquo;
       thought she as she replaced her glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she mounted her mule and returned to the Louvre, attended by her two
      pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe went back to the supper-table, but was thoughtful and gloomy
      even while he drank; the fine, austere face of Ambroise Pare seemed to
      reproach him for his apostasy. But subsequent events justified the
      manoeuvres of the old syndic. Christophe would certainly not have escaped
      the massacre of Saint-Bartholomew; his wealth and his landed estates would
      have made him a mark for the murderers. History has recorded the cruel
      fate of the wife of Lallier&rsquo;s successor, a beautiful woman, whose naked
      body hung by the hair for three days from one of the buttresses of the
      Pont au Change. Babette trembled as she thought that she, too, might have
      endured the same treatment if Christophe had continued a Calvinist,&mdash;for
      such became the name of the Reformers. Calvin&rsquo;s personal ambition was thus
      gratified, though not until after his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the origin of the celebrated parliamentary house of Lecamus.
      Tallemant des Reaux is in error when he states that they came originally
      from Picardy. It is only true that the Lecamus family found it for their
      interest in after days to date from the time the old furrier bought their
      principal estate, which, as we have said, was situated in Picardy.
      Christophe&rsquo;s son, who succeeded him under Louis XIII., was the father of
      the rich president Lecamus who built, in the reign of Louis XIV., that
      magnificent mansion which shares with the hotel Lambert the admiration of
      Parisians and foreigners, and was assuredly one of the finest buildings in
      Paris. It may still be seen in the rue Thorigny, though at the beginning
      of the Revolution it was pillaged as having belonged to Monsieur de
      Juigne, the archbishop of Paris. All the decorations were then destroyed;
      and the tenants who lodge there have greatly damaged it; nevertheless this
      palace, which is reached through the old house in the rue de la
      Pelleterie, still shows the noble results obtained in former days by the
      spirit of family. It may be doubted whether modern individualism, brought
      about by the equal division of inheritances, will ever raise such noble
      buildings.

    <h2>
      I. THE COURT UNDER CHARLES IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between eleven o&rsquo;clock and midnight toward the end of October, 1573, two
      Italians, Florentines and brothers, Albert de Gondi, Duc de Retz and
      marshal of France, and Charles de Gondi la Tour, Grand-master of the robes
      of Charles IX., were sitting on the roof of a house in the rue
      Saint-Honore, at the edge of a gutter. This gutter was one of those stone
      channels which in former days were constructed below the roofs of houses
      to receive the rain-water, discharging it at regular intervals through
      those long gargoyles carved in the shape of fantastic animals with gaping
      mouths. In spite of the zeal with which our present general pulls down and
      demolishes venerable buildings, there still existed many of these
      projecting gutters until, quite recently, an ordinance of the police as to
      water-conduits compelled them to disappear. But even so, a few of these
      carved gargoyles still remain, chiefly in the <i>quartier</i>
      Saint-Antoine, where low rents and values hinder the building of new
      storeys under the eaves of the roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly seems strange that two personages invested with such
      important offices should be playing the part of cats. But whosoever will
      burrow into the historic treasures of those days, when personal interests
      jostled and thwarted each other around the throne till the whole political
      centre of France was like a skein of tangled thread, will readily
      understand that the two Florentines were cats indeed, and very much in
      their places in a gutter. Their devotion to the person of the
      queen-mother, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici&mdash;who had brought them to the court
      of France and foisted them into their high offices&mdash;compelled them
      not to recoil before any of the consequences of their intrusion. But to
      explain how and why these courtiers were thus perched, it is necessary to
      relate a scene which had taken place an hour earlier not far from this
      very gutter, in that beautiful brown room of the Louvre, all that now
      remains to us of the apartments of Henri II., in which after supper the
      courtiers had been paying court to the two queens, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici
      and Elizabeth of Austria, and to their son and husband King Charles IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the majority of the burghers and great lords supped at six,
      or at seven o&rsquo;clock, but the more refined and elegant supped at eight or
      even nine. This repast was the dinner of to-day. Many persons erroneously
      believe that etiquette was invented by Louis XIV.; on the contrary it was
      introduced into France by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, who made it so severe that
      the Connetable de Montmorency had more difficulty in obtaining permission
      to enter the court of the Louvre on horseback than in winning his sword;
      moreover, that unheard-of distinction was granted to him only on account
      of his great age. Etiquette, which was, it is true, slightly relaxed under
      the first two Bourbon kings, took an Oriental form under the Great
      Monarch, for it was introduced from the Eastern Empire, which derived it
      from Persia. In 1573 few persons had the right to enter the courtyard of
      the Louvre with their servants and torches (under Louis XIV. the coaches
      of none but dukes and peers were allowed to pass under the peristyle);
      moreover, the cost of obtaining entrance after supper to the royal
      apartments was very heavy. The Marechal de Retz, whom we have just seen,
      perched on a gutter, offered on one occasion a thousand crowns of that
      day, six thousand francs of our present money, to the usher of the king&rsquo;s
      cabinet to be allowed to speak to Henri III. on a day when he was not on
      duty. To an historian who knows the truth, it is laughable to see the
      well-known picture of the courtyard at Blois, in which the artist has
      introduced a courtier on horseback!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, therefore, none but the most eminent personages
      in the kingdom were in the royal apartments. The queen, Elizabeth of
      Austria, and her mother-in-law, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, were seated together
      on the left of the fireplace. On the other side sat the king, buried in an
      arm-chair, affecting a lethargy consequent on digestion,&mdash;for he had
      just supped like a prince returned from hunting; possibly he was seeking
      to avoid conversation in presence of so many persons who were spies upon
      his thoughts. The courtiers stood erect and uncovered at the end of the
      room. Some talked in a low voice; others watched the king, awaiting the
      bestowal of a look or a word. Occasionally one was called up by the
      queen-mother, who talked with him for a few moments; another risked saying
      a word to the king, who replied with either a nod or a brief sentence. A
      German nobleman, the Comte de Solern, stood at the corner of the fireplace
      behind the young queen, the granddaughter of Charles V., whom he had
      accompanied into France. Near to her on a stool sat her lady of honor, the
      Comtesse de Fiesque, a Strozzi, and a relation of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
      The beautiful Madame de Sauves, a descendant of Jacques Coeur, mistress of
      the king of Navarre, then of the king of Poland, and lastly of the Duc
      d&rsquo;Alencon, had been invited to supper; but she stood like the rest of the
      court, her husband&rsquo;s rank (that of secretary of State) giving her no right
      to be seated. Behind these two ladies stood the two Gondis, talking to
      them. They alone of this dismal assembly were smiling. Albert Gondi, now
      Duc de Retz, marshal of France, and gentleman of the bed-chamber, had been
      deputed to marry the queen by proxy at Spire. In the first line of
      courtiers nearest to the king stood the Marechal de Tavannes, who was
      present on court business; Neufville de Villeroy, one of the ablest
      bankers of the period, who laid the foundation of the great house of that
      name; Birago and Chiverni, gentlemen of the queen-mother, who, knowing her
      preference for her son Henri (the brother whom Charles IX. regarded as an
      enemy), attached themselves especially to him; then Strozzi, Catherine&rsquo;s
      cousin; and finally, a number of great lords, among them the old Cardinal
      de Lorraine and his nephew, the young Duc de Guise, who were held at a
      distance by the king and his mother. These two leaders of the Holy
      Alliance, and later of the League (founded in conjunction with Spain a few
      years earlier), affected the submission of servants who are only waiting
      an opportunity to make themselves masters. Catherine and Charles IX.
      watched each other with close attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this gloomy court, as gloomy as the room in which it was held, each
      individual had his or her own reasons for being sad or thoughtful. The
      young queen, Elizabeth, was a prey to the tortures of jealousy, and could
      ill-disguise them, though she smiled upon her husband, whom she
      passionately adored, good and pious woman that she was! Marie Touchet, the
      only mistress Charles IX. ever had and to whom he was loyally faithful,
      had lately returned from the chateau de Fayet in Dauphine, whither she had
      gone to give birth to a child. She brought back to Charles IX. a son, his
      only son, Charles de Valois, first Comte d&rsquo;Auvergne, and afterward Duc
      d&rsquo;Angouleme. The poor queen, in addition to the mortification of her
      abandonment, now endured the pang of knowing that her rival had borne a
      son to her husband while she had brought him only a daughter. And these
      were not her only troubles and disillusions, for Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, who
      had seemed her friend in the first instance, now, out of policy, favored
      her betrayal, preferring to serve the mistress rather than the wife of the
      king,&mdash;for the following reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charles IX. openly avowed his passion for Marie Touchet, Catherine
      showed favor to the girl in the interests of her own desire for
      domination. Marie Touchet, who was very young when brought to court, came
      at an age when all the noblest sentiments are predominant. She loved the
      king for himself alone. Frightened at the fate to which ambition had led
      the Duchesse de Valentinois (better known as Diane de Poitiers), she
      dreaded the queen-mother, and greatly preferred her simple happiness to
      grandeur. Perhaps she thought that lovers as young as the king and herself
      could never struggle successfully against the queen-mother. As the
      daughter of Jean Touchet, Sieur de Beauvais and Quillard, she was born
      between the burgher class and the lower nobility; she had none of the
      inborn ambitions of the Pisseleus and Saint-Valliers, girls of rank, who
      battled for their families with the hidden weapons of love. Marie Touchet,
      without family or friends, spared Catherine de&rsquo; Medici all antagonism with
      her son&rsquo;s mistress; the daughter of a great house would have been her
      rival. Jean Touchet, the father, one of the finest wits of the time, a man
      to whom poets dedicated their works, wanted nothing at court. Marie, a
      young girl without connections, intelligent and well-educated, and also
      simple and artless, whose desires would probably never be aggressive to
      the royal power, suited the queen-mother admirably. In short, she made the
      parliament recognize the son to whom Marie Touchet had just given birth in
      the month of April, and she allowed him to take the title of Comte
      d&rsquo;Auvergne, assuring Charles IX. that she would leave the boy her personal
      property, the counties of Auvergne and Laraguais. At a later period,
      Marguerite de Valois, queen of Navarre, contested this legacy after she
      was queen of France, and the parliament annulled it. But later still,
      Louis XIII., out of respect for the Valois blood, indemnified the Comte
      d&rsquo;Auvergne by the gift of the duchy of Angouleme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine had already given Marie Touchet, who asked nothing, the manor of
      Belleville, an estate close to Vincennes which carried no title; and
      thither she went whenever the king hunted and spent the night at the
      castle. It was in this gloomy fortress that Charles IX. passed the greater
      part of his last years, ending his life there, according to some
      historians, as Louis XII. had ended his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother kept close watch upon her son. All the occupations of his
      personal life, outside of politics, were reported to her. The king had
      begun to look upon his mother as an enemy, but the kind intentions she
      expressed toward his son diverted his suspicions for a time. Catherine&rsquo;s
      motives in this matter were never understood by Queen Elizabeth, who,
      according to Brantome, was one of the gentlest queens that ever reigned,
      who never did harm or even gave pain to any one, &ldquo;and was careful to read
      her prayer-book secretly.&rdquo; But this single-minded princess began at last
      to see the precipices yawning around the throne,&mdash;a dreadful
      discovery, which might indeed have made her quail; it was some such
      remembrance, no doubt, that led her to say to one of her ladies, after the
      death of the king, in reply to a condolence that she had no son, and could
      not, therefore, be regent and queen-mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I thank God that I have no son. I know well what would have happened.
      My poor son would have been despoiled and wronged like the king, my
      husband, and I should have been the cause of it. God had mercy on the
      State; he has done all for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This princess, whose portrait Brantome thinks he draws by saying that her
      complexion was as beautiful and delicate as the ladies of her suite were
      charming and agreeable, and that her figure was fine though rather short,
      was of little account at her own court. Suffering from a double grief, her
      saddened attitude added another gloomy tone to a scene which most young
      queens, less cruelly injured, might have enlivened. The pious Elizabeth
      proved at this crisis that the qualities which are the shining glory of
      women in the ordinary ways of life can be fatal to a sovereign. A princess
      able to occupy herself with other things besides her prayer-book might
      have been a useful helper to Charles IX., who found no prop to lean on,
      either in his wife or in his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother, as she sat there in that brown room, was closely
      observing the king, who, during supper, had exhibited a boisterous
      good-humor which she felt to be assumed in order to mask some intention
      against her. This sudden gaiety contrasted too vividly with the struggle
      of mind he endeavored to conceal by his eagerness in hunting, and by an
      almost maniacal toil at his forge, where he spent many hours in hammering
      iron; and Catherine was not deceived by it. Without being able even to
      guess which of the statesmen about the king was employed to prepare or
      negotiate it (for Charles IX. contrived to mislead his mother&rsquo;s spies),
      Catherine felt no doubt whatever that some scheme for her overthrow was
      being planned. The unlooked-for presence of Tavannes, who arrived at the
      same time as Strozzi, whom she herself had summoned, gave her food for
      thought. Strong in the strength of her political combination, Catherine
      was above the reach of circumstances; but she was powerless against some
      hidden violence. As many persons are ignorant of the actual state of
      public affairs then so complicated by the various parties that distracted
      France, the leaders of which had each their private interests to carry
      out, it is necessary to describe, in a few words, the perilous game in
      which the queen-mother was now engaged. To show Catherine de&rsquo; Medici in a
      new light is, in fact, the root and stock of our present history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two words explain this woman, so curiously interesting to study, a woman
      whose influence has left such deep impressions upon France. Those words
      are: Power and Astrology. Exclusively ambitious, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici had
      no other passion than that of power. Superstitious and fatalistic, like so
      many superior men, she had no sincere belief except in occult sciences.
      Unless this double mainspring is known, the conduct of Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici will remain forever misunderstood. As we picture her faith in
      judicial astrology, the light will fall upon two personages, who are, in
      fact, the philosophical subjects of this Study.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lived a man for whom Catherine cared more than for any of her
      children; his name was Cosmo Ruggiero. He lived in a house belonging to
      her, the hotel de Soissons; she made him her supreme adviser. It was his
      duty to tell her whether the stars ratified the advice and judgment of her
      ordinary counsellors. Certain remarkable antecedents warranted the power
      which Cosmo Ruggiero retained over his mistress to her last hour. One of
      the most learned men of the sixteenth century was physician to Lorenzo de&rsquo; 
      Medici, Duc d&rsquo;Urbino, Catherine&rsquo;s father. This physician was called
      Ruggiero the Elder (Vecchio Ruggier and Roger l&rsquo;Ancien in the French
      authors who have written on alchemy), to distinguish him from his two
      sons, Lorenzo Ruggiero, called the Great by cabalistic writers, and Cosmo
      Ruggiero, Catherine&rsquo;s astrologer, also called Roger by several French
      historians. In France it was the custom to pronounce the name in general
      as Ruggieri. Ruggiero the elder was so highly valued by the Medici that
      the two dukes, Cosmo and Lorenzo, stood godfathers to his two sons. He
      cast, in concert with the famous mathematician, Basilio, the horoscope of
      Catherine&rsquo;s nativity, in his official capacity as mathematicion,
      astrologer, and physician to the house of Medici; three offices which are
      often confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period of which we write the occult sciences were studied with an
      ardor that may surprise the incredulous minds of our own age, which is
      supremely analytical. Perhaps such minds may find in this historical
      sketch the dawn, or rather the germ, of the positive sciences which have
      flowered in the nineteenth century, though without the poetic grandeur
      given to them by the audacious Seekers of the sixteenth, who, instead of
      using them solely for mechanical industries, magnified Art and fertilized
      Thought by their means. The protection universally given to occult science
      by the sovereigns of those days was justified by the noble creations of
      many inventors, who, starting in quest of the Great Work (the so-called
      philosophers&rsquo; stone), attained to astonishing results. At no period were
      the sovereigns of the world more eager for the study of these mysteries.
      The Fuggers of Augsburg, in whom all modern Luculluses will recognize
      their princes, and all bankers their masters, were gifted with powers of
      calculation it would be difficult to surpass. Well, those practical men,
      who loaned the funds of all Europe to the sovereigns of the sixteenth
      century (as deeply in debt as the kings of the present day), those
      illustrious guests of Charles V. were sleeping partners in the crucibles
      of Paracelsus. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, Ruggiero the
      elder was the head of that secret university from which issued the
      Cardans, the Nostradamuses, and the Agrippas (all in their turn physicians
      of the house of Valois); also the astronomers, astrologers, and alchemists
      who surrounded the princes of Christendom and were more especially
      welcomed and protected in France by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. In the nativity
      drawn by Basilio and Ruggiero the elder, the principal events of
      Catherine&rsquo;s life were foretold with a correctness which is quite
      disheartening for those who deny the power of occult science. This
      horoscope predicted the misfortunes which during the siege of Florence
      imperilled the beginning of her life; also her marriage with a son of the
      king of France, the unexpected succession of that son to his father&rsquo;s
      throne, the birth of her children, their number, and the fact that three
      of her sons would be kings in succession, that two of her daughters would
      be queens, and that all of them were destined to die without posterity.
      This prediction was so fully realized that many historians have assumed
      that it was written after the events.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that Nostradamus took to the chateau de Chaumont, whither
      Catherine went after the conspiracy of La Renaudie, a woman who possessed
      the faculty of reading the future. Now, during the reign of Francois II.,
      while the queen had with her her four sons, all young and in good health,
      and before the marriage of her daughter Elizabeth with Philip II., king of
      Spain, or that of her daughter Marguerite with Henri de Bourbon, king of
      Navarre (afterward Henri IV.), Nostradamus and this woman reiterated the
      circumstances formerly predicted in the famous nativity. This woman, who
      was no doubt gifted with second sight, and who belonged to the great
      school of Seekers of the Great Work, though the particulars of her life
      and name are lost to history, stated that the last crowned child would be
      assassinated. Having placed the queen-mother in front of a magic mirror,
      in which was reflected a wheel on the several spokes of which were the
      faces of her children, the sorceress set the wheel revolving, and
      Catherine counted the number of revolutions which it made. Each revolution
      was for each son one year of his reign. Henri IV. was also put upon the
      wheel, which then made twenty-four rounds, and the woman (some historians
      have said it was a man) told the frightened queen that Henri de Bourbon
      would be king of France and reign that number of years. From that time
      forth Catherine de&rsquo; Medici vowed a mortal hatred to the man whom she knew
      would succeed the last of her Valois sons, who was to die assassinated.
      Anxious to know what her own death would be, she was warned to beware of
      Saint-Germain. Supposing, therefore, that she would be either put to death
      or imprisoned in the chateau de Saint-Germain, she would never so much as
      put her foot there, although that residence was far more convenient for
      her political plans, owing to its proximity to Paris, than the other
      castles to which she retreated with the king during the troubles. When she
      was taken suddenly ill, a few days after the murder of the Duc de Guise at
      Blois, she asked the name of the bishop who came to assist her. Being told
      it was Saint-Germain, she cried out, &ldquo;I am dead!&rdquo; and did actually die on
      the morrow,&mdash;having, moreover, lived the exact number of years given
      to her by all her horoscopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These predictions, which were known to the Cardinal de Lorraine, who
      regarded them as witchcraft, were now in process of realization. Francois
      II. had reigned his two revolutions of the wheel, and Charles IX. was now
      making his last turn. If Catherine said the strange words which history
      has attributed to her when her son Henri started for Poland,&mdash;&ldquo;You
      will soon return,&rdquo;&mdash;they must be set down to her faith in occult
      science and not to the intention of poisoning Charles IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other circumstances corroborated Catherine&rsquo;s faith in the occult
      sciences. The night before the tournament at which Henri II. was killed,
      Catherine saw the fatal blow in a dream. Her astrological council, then
      composed of Nostradamus and the two Ruggieri, had already predicted to her
      the death of the king. History has recorded the efforts made by Catherine
      to persuade her husband not to enter the lists. The prognostic, and the
      dream produced by the prognostic, were verified. The memoirs of the day
      relate another fact that was no less singular. The courier who announced
      the victory of Moncontour arrived in the night, after riding with such
      speed that he killed three horses. The queen-mother was awakened to
      receive the news, to which she replied, &ldquo;I knew it already.&rdquo; In fact, as
      Brantome relates, she had told of her son&rsquo;s triumph the evening before,
      and narrated several circumstances of the battle. The astrologer of the
      house of Bourbon predicted that the youngest of all the princes descended
      from Saint-Louis (the son of Antoine de Bourbon) would ascend the throne
      of France. This prediction, related by Sully, was accomplished in the
      precise terms of the horoscope; which led Henri IV. to say that by dint of
      lying these people sometimes hit the truth. However that may be, if most
      of the great minds of that epoch believed in this vast science,&mdash;called
      Magic by the masters of judicial astrology, and Sorcery by the public,&mdash;they
      were justified in doing so by the fulfilment of horoscopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for the use of Cosmo Ruggiero, her mathematician, astronomer, and
      astrologer, that Catherine de&rsquo; Medici erected the tower behind the Halle
      aux Bles,&mdash;all that now remains of the hotel de Soissons. Cosmo
      Ruggiero possessed, like confessors, a mysterious influence, the
      possession of which, like them again, sufficed him. He cherished an
      ambitious thought superior to all vulgar ambitions. This man, whom
      dramatists and romance-writers depict as a juggler, owned the rich abbey
      of Saint-Mahe in Lower Brittany, and refused many high ecclesiastical
      dignities; the gold which the superstitious passions of the age poured
      into his coffers sufficed for his secret enterprise; and the queen&rsquo;s hand,
      stretched above his head, preserved every hair of it from danger.

      II. SCHEMES AGAINST SCHEMES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The thirst for power which consumed the queen-mother, her desire for
      dominion, was so great that in order to retain it she had, as we have
      seen, allied herself to the Guises, those enemies of the throne; to keep
      the reins of power, now obtained, within her hands, she was using every
      means, even to the sacrifice of her friends and that of her children. This
      woman, of whom one of her enemies said at her death, &ldquo;It is more than a
      queen, it is monarchy itself that has died,&rdquo;&mdash;this woman could not
      exist without the intrigues of government, as a gambler can live only by
      the emotions of play. Although she was an Italian of the voluptuous race
      of the Medici, the Calvinists who calumniated her never accused her of
      having a lover. A great admirer of the maxim, &ldquo;Divide to reign,&rdquo; she had
      learned the art of perpetually pitting one force against another. No
      sooner had she grasped the reins of power than she was forced to keep up
      dissensions in order to neutralize the strength of two rival houses, and
      thus save the Crown. Catherine invented the game of political see-saw
      (since imitated by all princes who find themselves in a like situation),
      by instigating, first the Calvinists against the Guises, and then the
      Guises against the Calvinists. Next, after pitting the two religions
      against each other in the heart of the nation, Catherine instigated the
      Duc d&rsquo;Anjou against his brother Charles IX. After neutralizing events by
      opposing them to one another, she neutralized men, by holding the thread
      of all their interests in her hands. But so fearful a game, which needs
      the head of a Louis XI. to play it, draws down inevitably the hatred of
      all parties upon the player, who condemns himself forever to the necessity
      of conquering; for one lost game will turn every selfish interest into an
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of the reign of Charles IX. witnessed the triumph of the
      domestic policy of this astonishing woman. What adroit persuasion must
      Catherine have employed to have obtained the command of the armies for the
      Duc d&rsquo;Anjou under a young and brave king, thirsting for glory, capable of
      military achievement, generous, and in presence, too, of the Connetable de
      Montmorency. In the eyes of the statesmen of Europe the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou had
      all the honors of the Saint-Bartholomew, and Charles IX. all the odium.
      After inspiring the king with a false and secret jealousy of his brother,
      she used that passion to wear out by the intrigues of fraternal jealousy
      the really noble qualities of Charles IX. Cypierre, the king&rsquo;s first
      governor, and Amyot, his first tutor, had made him so great a man, they
      had paved the way for so noble a reign, that the queen-mother began to
      hate her son as soon as she found reason to fear the loss of the power she
      had so slowly and so painfully obtained. On these general grounds most
      historians have believed that Catherine de&rsquo; Medici felt a preference for
      Henri III.; but her conduct at the period of which we are now writing,
      proves the absolute indifference of her heart toward all her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou went to reign in Poland Catherine was deprived of the
      instrument by which she had worked to keep the king&rsquo;s passions occupied in
      domestic intrigues, which neutralized his energy in other directions. She
      then set up the conspiracy of La Mole and Coconnas, in which her youngest
      son, the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon (afterwards Duc d&rsquo;Anjou, on the accession of Henri
      III.) took part, lending himself very willingly to his mother&rsquo;s wishes,
      and displaying an ambition much encouraged by his sister Marguerite, then
      queen of Navarre. This secret conspiracy had now reached the point to
      which Catherine sought to bring it. Its object was to put the young duke
      and his brother-in-law, the king of Navarre, at the head of the
      Calvinists, to seize the person of Charles IX., and imprison that king
      without an heir,&mdash;leaving the throne to the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, whose
      intention it was to establish Calvinism as the religion of France. Calvin,
      as we have already said, had obtained, a few days before his death, the
      reward he had so deeply coveted,&mdash;the Reformation was now called
      Calvinism in his honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Le Laboureur and other sensible writers had not already proved that La
      Mole and Coconnas,&mdash;arrested fifty nights after the day on which our
      present history begins, and beheaded the following April,&mdash;even, we
      say, if it had not been made historically clear that these men were the
      victims of the queen-mother&rsquo;s policy, the part which Cosmo Ruggiero took
      in this affair would go far to show that she secretly directed their
      enterprise. Ruggiero, against whom the king had suspicions, and for whom
      he cherished a hatred the motives of which we are about to explain, was
      included in the prosecution. He admitted having given to La Mole a wax
      figure representing the king, which was pierced through the heart by two
      needles. This method of casting spells constituted a crime, which, in
      those days, was punished by death. It presents one of the most startling
      and infernal images of hatred that humanity could invent; it pictures
      admirably the magnetic and terrible working in the occult world of a
      constant malevolent desire surrounding the person doomed to death; the
      effects of which on the person are exhibited by the figure of wax. The law
      in those days thought, and thought justly, that a desire to which an
      actual form was given should be regarded as a crime of <i>lese majeste</i>.
      Charles IX. demanded the death of Ruggiero; Catherine, more powerful than
      her son, obtained from the Parliament, through the young counsellor,
      Lecamus, a commutation of the sentence, and Cosmo was sent to the galleys.
      The following year, on the death of the king, he was pardoned by a decree
      of Henri III., who restored his pension, and received him at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to return now to the moment of which we are writing, Catherine had,
      by this time, struck so many blows on the heart of her son that he was
      eagerly desirous of casting off her yoke. During the absence of Marie
      Touchet, Charles IX., deprived of his usual occupation, had taken to
      observing everything about him. He cleverly set traps for the persons in
      whom he trusted most, in order to test their fidelity. He spied on his
      mother&rsquo;s actions, concealing from her all knowledge of his own, employing
      for this deception the evil qualities she had fostered in him. Consumed by
      a desire to blot out the horror excited in France by the
      Saint-Bartholomew, he busied himself actively in public affairs; he
      presided at the Council, and tried to seize the reins of government by
      well-laid schemes. Though the queen-mother endeavored to check these
      attempts of her son by employing all the means of influence over his mind
      which her maternal authority and a long habit of domineering gave her, his
      rush into distrust was so vehement that he went too far at the first bound
      ever to return from it. The day on which his mother&rsquo;s speech to the king
      of Poland was reported to him, Charles IX., conscious of his failing
      health, conceived the most horrible suspicions, and when such thoughts
      take possession of the mind of a son and a king nothing can remove them.
      In fact, on his deathbed, at the moment when he confided his wife and
      daughter to Henri IV., he began to put the latter on his guard against
      Catherine, so that she cried out passionately, endeavoring to silence him,
      &ldquo;Do not say that, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Charles IX. never ceased to show her the outward respect of which
      she was so tenacious that she would never call the kings her sons anything
      but &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; the queen-mother had detected in her son&rsquo;s manner during
      the last few months an ill-disguised purpose of vengeance. But clever
      indeed must be the man who counted on taking Catherine unawares. She held
      ready in her hand at this moment the conspiracy of the Duke d&rsquo;Alencon and
      La Mole, in order to counteract, by another fraternal struggle, the
      efforts Charles IX. was making toward emancipation. But, before employing
      this means, she wanted to remove his distrust of her, which would render
      impossible their future reconciliation; for was he likely to restore power
      to the hands of a mother whom he thought capable of poisoning him? She
      felt herself at this moment in such serious danger that she had sent for
      Strozzi, her relation and a soldier noted for his promptitude of action.
      She took counsel in secret with Birago and the two Gondis, and never did
      she so frequently consult her oracle, Cosmo Ruggiero, as at the present
      crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the habit of dissimulation, together with advancing age, had given
      the queen-mother that well-known abbess face, with its haughty and
      macerated mask, expressionless yet full of depth, inscrutable yet
      vigilant, remarked by all who have studied her portrait, the courtiers now
      observed some clouds on her icy countenance. No sovereign was ever so
      imposing as this woman from the day when she succeeded in restraining the
      Guises after the death of Francois II. Her black velvet cap, made with a
      point upon the forehead (for she never relinquished her widow&rsquo;s mourning)
      seemed a species of feminine cowl around the cold, imperious face, to
      which, however, she knew how to give, at the right moment, a seductive
      Italian charm. Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was so well made that she was accused
      of inventing side-saddles to show the shape of her legs, which were
      absolutely perfect. Women followed her example in this respect throughout
      Europe, which even then took its fashions from France. Those who desire to
      bring this grand figure before their minds will find that the scene now
      taking place in the brown hall of the Louvre presents it in a striking
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two queens, different in spirit, in beauty, in dress, and now
      estranged,&mdash;one naive and thoughtful, the other thoughtful and
      gravely abstracted,&mdash;were far too preoccupied to think of giving the
      order awaited by the courtiers for the amusements of the evening. The
      carefully concealed drama, played for the last six months by the mother
      and son was more than suspected by many of the courtiers; but the Italians
      were watching it with special anxiety, for Catherine&rsquo;s failure involved
      their ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this evening Charles IX., weary with the day&rsquo;s hunting, looked to
      be forty years old. He had reached the last stages of the malady of which
      he died, the symptoms of which were such that many reflecting persons were
      justified in thinking that he was poisoned. According to de Thou (the
      Tacitus of the Valois) the surgeons found suspicious spots&mdash;<i>ex
      causa incognita reperti livores</i>&mdash;on his body. Moreover, his
      funeral was even more neglected than that of Francois II. The body was
      conducted from Saint-Lazare to Saint-Denis by Brantome and a few archers
      of the guard under command of the Comte de Solern. This circumstances,
      coupled with the supposed hatred of the mother to the son, may or may not
      give color to de Thou&rsquo;s supposition, but it proves how little affection
      Catherine felt for any of her children,&mdash;a want of feeling which may
      be explained by her implicit faith in the predictions of judicial
      astrology. This woman was unable to feel affection for the instruments
      which were destined to fail her. Henri III. was the last king under whom
      her reign of power was to last; that was the sole consideration of her
      heart and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days, however, we can readily believe that Charles IX. died a
      natural death. His excesses, his manner of life, the sudden development of
      his faculties, his last spasmodic attempt to recover the reins of power,
      his desire to live, the abuse of his vital strength, his final sufferings
      and last pleasures, all prove to an impartial mind that he died of
      consumption, a disease scarcely studied at that time, and very little
      understood, the symptoms of which might, not unnaturally, lead Charles IX.
      to believe himself poisoned. The real poison which his mother gave him was
      in the fatal counsels of the courtiers whom she placed about him,&mdash;men
      who led him to waste his intellectual as well as his physical vigor, thus
      bringing on a malady which was purely fortuitous and not constitutional.
      Under these harrowing circumstances, Charles IX. displayed a gloomy
      majesty of demeanor which was not unbecoming to a king. The solemnity of
      his secret thoughts was reflected on his face, the olive tones of which he
      inherited from his mother. This ivory pallor, so fine by candlelight, so
      suited to the expression of melancholy thought, brought out vigorously the
      fire of the blue-black eyes, which gazed from their thick and heavy lids
      with the keen perception our fancy lends to kings, their color being a
      cloak for dissimulation. Those eyes were terrible,&mdash;especially from
      the movement of their brows, which he could raise or lower at will on his
      bald, high forehead. His nose was broad and long, thick at the end,&mdash;the
      nose of a lion; his ears were large, his hair sandy, his lips blood-red,
      like those of all consumptives, the upper lip thin and sarcastic, the
      lower one firm, and full enough to give an impression of the noblest
      qualities of the heart. The wrinkles of his brow, the youth of which was
      killed by dreadful cares, inspired the strongest interest; remorse, caused
      by the uselessness of the Saint-Bartholomew, accounted for some, but there
      were two others on that face which would have been eloquent indeed to any
      student whose premature genius had led him to divine the principles of
      modern physiology. These wrinkles made a deeply indented furrow going from
      each cheek-bone to each corner of the mouth, revealing the inward efforts
      of an organization wearied by the toil of thought and the violent
      excitements of the body. Charles IX. was worn-out. If policy did not
      stifle remorse in the breasts of those who sit beneath the purple, the
      queen-mother, looking at her own work, would surely have felt it. Had
      Catherine foreseen the effect of her intrigues upon her son, would she
      have recoiled from them? What a fearful spectacle was this! A king born
      vigorous, and now so feeble; a mind powerfully tempered, shaken by
      distrust; a man clothed with authority, conscious of no support; a firm
      mind brought to the pass of having lost all confidence in itself! His
      warlike valor had changed by degrees to ferocity; his discretion to
      deceit; the refined and delicate love of a Valois was now a mere
      quenchless thirst for pleasure. This perverted and misjudged great man,
      with all the many facets of a noble soul worn-out,&mdash;a king without
      power, a generous heart without a friend, dragged hither and thither by a
      thousand conflicting intrigues,&mdash;presented the melancholy spectacle
      of a youth, only twenty-four years old, disillusioned of life, distrusting
      everybody and everything, now resolving to risk all, even his life, on a
      last effort. For some time past he had fully understood his royal mission,
      his power, his resources, and the obstacles which his mother opposed to
      the pacification of the kingdom; but alas! this light now burned in a
      shattered lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men, whom Charles IX. loved sufficiently to protect under
      circumstances of great danger,&mdash;Jean Chapelain, his physician, whom
      he saved from the Saint-Bartholomew, and Ambroise Pare, with whom he went
      to dine when Pare&rsquo;s enemies were accusing him of intending to poison the
      king,&mdash;had arrived this evening in haste from the provinces, recalled
      by the queen-mother. Both were watching their master anxiously. A few
      courtiers spoke to them in a low voice; but the men of science made
      guarded answers, carefully concealing the fatal verdict which was in their
      minds. Every now and then the king would raise his heavy eyelids and give
      his mother a furtive look which he tried to conceal from those about him.
      Suddenly he sprang up and stood before the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Chiverni,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;why do you keep the title of
      chancellor of Anjou and Poland? Are you in our service, or in that of our
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all yours, sire,&rdquo; replied Chiverni, bowing low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come to me to-morrow; I intend to send you to Spain. Very strange
      things are happening at the court of Madrid, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at his wife and flung himself back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange things are happening everywhere,&rdquo; said the Marechal de Tavannes,
      one of the friends of the king&rsquo;s youth, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king rose again and led this companion of his youthful pleasures apart
      into the embrasure of the window at the corner of the room, saying, when
      they were out of hearing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you. Remain here when the others go. I shall know to-night whether
      you are for me or against me. Don&rsquo;t look astonished. I am about to burst
      my bonds. My mother is the cause of all the evil about me. Three months
      hence I shall be king indeed, or dead. Silence, if you value your life!
      You will have my secret, you and Solern and Villeroy only. If it is
      betrayed, it will be by one of you three. Don&rsquo;t keep near me; go and pay
      your court to my mother. Tell her I am dying, and that you don&rsquo;t regret
      it, for I am only a poor creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was leaning on the shoulder of his old favorite, and pretending
      to tell him of his ailments, in order to mislead the inquisitive eyes
      about him; then, not wishing to make his aversion too visible, he went up
      to his wife and mother and talked with them, calling Birago to their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Pinard, one of the secretaries of State, glided like an eel
      through the door and along the wall until he reached the queen-mother, in
      whose ear he said a few words, to which she replied by an affirmative
      sign. The king did not ask his mother the meaning of this conference, but
      he returned to his seat and kept silence, darting terrible looks of anger
      and suspicion all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little circumstance seemed of enormous consequence in the eyes of the
      courtiers; and, in truth, so marked an exercise of power by the
      queen-mother, without reference to the king, was like a drop of water
      overflowing the cup. Queen Elizabeth and the Comtesse de Fiesque now
      retired, but the king paid no attention to their movements, though the
      queen-mother rose and attended her daughter-in-law to the door; after
      which the courtiers, understanding that their presence was unwelcome, took
      their leave. By ten o&rsquo;clock no one remained in the hall but a few
      intimates,&mdash;the two Gondis, Tavannes, Solern, Birago, the king, and
      the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king sat plunged in the blackest melancholy. The silence was
      oppressive. Catherine seemed embarrassed. She wished to leave the room,
      and waited for the king to escort her to the door; but he still continued
      obstinately lost in thought. At last she rose to bid him good-night, and
      Charles IX. was forced to do likewise. As she took his arm and made a few
      steps toward the door, she bent to his ear and whispered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I have important things to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing a mirror on her way, she glanced into it and made a sign with her
      eyes to the two Gondis, which escaped the king&rsquo;s notice, for he was at the
      moment exchanging looks of intelligence with the Comte de Solern and
      Villeroy. Tavannes was thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the latter, coming out of his reverie, &ldquo;I think you are
      royally ennuyed; don&rsquo;t you ever amuse yourself now? <i>Vive Dieu</i>! have
      you forgotten the times when we used to vagabondize about the streets at
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! those were the good old times!&rdquo; said the king, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not bring them back?&rdquo; said Birago, glancing significantly at the
      Gondis as he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I always think of those days with pleasure,&rdquo; said Albert de Gondi,
      Duc de Retz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you on the roofs once more, monsieur le duc,&rdquo; remarked
      Tavannes. &ldquo;Damned Italian cat! I wish he might break his neck!&rdquo; he added
      in a whisper to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which of us two could climb the quickest in these days,&rdquo;
       replied de Gondi; &ldquo;but one thing I do know, that neither of us fears to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sire, will you start upon a frolic in the streets to-night, as you
      did in the days of your youth?&rdquo; said the other Gondi, master of the
      Wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days of his youth! so at twenty-four years of age the wretched king
      seemed no longer young to any one, not even to his flatterers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tavannes and his master now reminded each other, like two school-boys, of
      certain pranks they had played in Paris, and the evening&rsquo;s amusement was
      soon arranged. The two Italians, challenged to climb roofs, and jump from
      one to another across alleys and streets, wagered that they would follow
      the king wherever he went. They and Tavannes went off to change their
      clothes. The Comte de Solern, left alone with the king, looked at him in
      amazement. Though the worthy German, filled with compassion for the
      hapless position of the king of France, was honor and fidelity itself, he
      was certainly not quick of perception. Charles IX., surrounded by hostile
      persons, unable to trust any one, not even his wife (who had been guilty
      of some indiscretions, unaware as she was that his mother and his servants
      were his enemies), had been fortunate enough to find in Monsieur de Solern
      a faithful friend in whom he could place entire confidence. Tavannes and
      Villeroy were trusted with only a part of the king&rsquo;s secrets. The Comte de
      Solern alone knew the whole of the plan which he was now about to carry
      out. This devoted friend was also useful to his master, in possessing a
      body of discreet and affectionate followers, who blindly obeyed his
      orders. He commanded a detachment of the archers of the guards, and for
      the last few days he had been sifting out the men who were faithfully
      attached to the king, in order to make a company of tried men when the
      need came. The king took thought of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you surprised, Solern?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know very well I need a
      pretext to be out to-night. It is true, I have Madame de Belleville, but
      this is better; for who knows whether my mother does not hear of all that
      goes on at Marie&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Solern, who was to follow the king, asked if he might not take
      a few of his Germans to patrol the streets, and Charles consented. About
      eleven o&rsquo;clock the king, who was now very gay, set forth with his three
      courtiers,&mdash;namely, Tavannes and the two Gondis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and take my little Marie by surprise,&rdquo; said Charles IX. to
      Tavannes, &ldquo;as we pass through the rue de l&rsquo;Autruche.&rdquo; That street being on
      the way to the rue Saint-Honore, it would have been strange indeed for the
      king to pass the house of his love without stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out for a chance of mischief,&mdash;a belated burgher to frighten,
      or a watchman to thrash&mdash;the king went along with his nose in the
      air, watching all the lighted windows to see what was happening, and
      striving to hear the conversations. But alas! he found his good city of
      Paris in a state of deplorable tranquillity. Suddenly, as he passed the
      house of a perfumer named Rene, who supplied the court, the king, noticing
      a strong light from a window in the roof, was seized by one of those
      apparently hasty inspirations which, to some minds, suggest a previous
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      This perfumer was strongly suspected of curing rich uncles who thought
      themselves ill. The court laid at his door the famous &ldquo;Elixir of
      Inheritance,&rdquo; and even accused him of poisoning Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, mother of
      Henri of Navarre, who was buried (in spite of Charles IX.&lsquo;s positive
      order) without her head being opened. For the last two months the king had
      sought some way of sending a spy into Rene&rsquo;s laboratory, where, as he was
      well aware, Cosmo Ruggiero spent much time. The king intended, if anything
      suspicious were discovered, to proceed in the matter alone, without the
      assistance of the police or law, with whom, as he well knew, his mother
      would counteract him by means of either corruption or fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that during the sixteenth century, and the years that
      preceded and followed it, poisoning was brought to a perfection unknown to
      modern chemistry, as history itself will prove. Italy, the cradle of
      modern science, was, at this period, the inventor and mistress of these
      secrets, many of which are now lost. Hence the reputation for that crime
      which weighed for the two following centuries on Italy. Romance-writers
      have so greatly abused it that wherever they have introduced Italians into
      their tales they have almost always made them play the part of assassins
      and poisoners.[*] If Italy then had the traffic in subtle poisons which
      some historians attribute to her, we should remember her supremacy in the
      art of toxicology, as we do her pre-eminence in all other human knowledge
      and art in which she took the lead in Europe. The crimes of that period
      were not her crimes specially. She served the passions of the age, just as
      she built magnificent edifices, commanded armies, painted noble frescos,
      sang romances, loved queens, delighted kings, devised ballets and fetes,
      and ruled all policies. The horrible art of poisoning reached to such a
      pitch in Florence that a woman, dividing a peach with a duke, using a
      golden fruit-knife with one side of its blade poisoned, ate one half of
      the peach herself and killed the duke with the other half. A pair of
      perfumed gloves were known to have infiltrated mortal illness through the
      pores of the skin. Poison was instilled into bunches of natural roses, and
      the fragrance, when inhaled, gave death. Don John of Austria was poisoned,
      it was said, by a pair of boots.
    </p>

     [*] Written sixty-six years ago.&mdash;Tr.
</pre>
    <p>
      Charles IX. had good reason to be curious in the matter; we know already
      the dark suspicions and beliefs which now prompted him to surprise the
      perfumer Rene at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fountain at the corner of the rue de l&rsquo;Arbre-See, which has since
      been rebuilt, offered every facility for the royal vagabonds to climb upon
      the roof of a house not far from that of Rene, which the king wished to
      visit. Charles, followed by his companions, began to ramble over the
      roofs, to the great terror of the burghers awakened by the tramp of these
      false thieves, who called to them in saucy language, listened to their
      talk, and even pretended to force an entrance. When the Italians saw the
      king and Tavannes threading their way among the roofs of the house next to
      that of Rene, Albert de Gondi sat down, declaring that he was tired, and
      his brother followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; thought the king, glad to leave his spies behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tavannes began to laugh at the two Florentines, left sitting alone in the
      midst of deep silence, in a place where they had nought but the skies
      above them, and the cats for auditors. But the brothers made use of their
      position to exchange thoughts they would not dare to utter on any other
      spot in the world,&mdash;thoughts inspired by the events of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; said the Grand-master to the marechal, &ldquo;the king will get the
      better of the queen-mother; we are doing a foolish thing for our own
      interests to stay by those of Catherine. If we go over to the king now,
      when he is searching everywhere for support against her and for able men
      to serve him, we shall not be driven away like wild beasts when the
      queen-mother is banished, imprisoned, or killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t get far with such ideas, Charles,&rdquo; replied the marechal,
      gravely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d follow the king into the grave, and he won&rsquo;t live long; he
      is ruined by excesses. Cosmo Ruggiero predicts his death within a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dying boar has often killed the huntsman,&rdquo; said Charles de Gondi.
      &ldquo;This conspiracy of the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, the king of Navarre, and the Prince
      de Conde, with whom La Mole and Coconnas are negotiating, is more
      dangerous than useful. In the first place, the king of Navarre, whom the
      queen-mother hoped to catch in the very act, distrusts her, and declines
      to run his head into the noose. He means to profit by the conspiracy
      without taking any of its risks. Besides, the notion now is to put the
      crown on the head of the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, who has turned Calvinist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Budelone</i>! but don&rsquo;t you see that this conspiracy enables the
      queen-mother to find out what the Huguenots can do with the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon,
      and what the king can do with the Huguenots?&mdash;for the king is even
      now negotiating with them; but he&rsquo;ll be finely pilloried to-morrow, when
      Catherine reveals to him the counter-conspiracy which will neutralize all
      his projects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles de Gondi, &ldquo;by dint of profiting by our advice
      she&rsquo;s clever and stronger than we! Well, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right for the Duc d&rsquo;Anjou, who prefers to be king of France rather
      than king of Poland; I am going now to explain the matter to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you start, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow. I am ordered to accompany the king of Poland; and I expect to
      join him in Venice, where the patricians have taken upon themselves to
      amuse and delay him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prudence itself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Che bestia</i>! I swear to you there is not the slightest danger for
      either of us in remaining at court. If there were, do you think I would go
      away? I should stay by the side of our kind mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind!&rdquo; exclaimed the Grand-master; &ldquo;she is a woman to drop all her
      instruments the moment she finds them heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>O coglione</i>! you pretend to be a soldier, and you fear death! Every
      business has its duties, and we have ours in making our fortune. By
      attaching ourselves to kings, the source of all temporal power which
      protects, elevates, and enriches families, we are forced to give them as
      devoted a love as that which burns in the hearts of martyrs toward heaven.
      We must suffer in their cause; when they sacrifice us to the interests of
      their throne we may perish, for we die as much for ourselves as for them,
      but our name and our families perish not. <i>Ecco</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right as to yourself, Albert; for they have given you the ancient
      title and duchy of de Retz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; replied his brother. &ldquo;The queen hopes much from the
      cleverness of the Ruggieri; she expects them to bring the king once more
      under her control. When Charles refused to use Rene&rsquo;s perfumes any longer
      the wary woman knew at once on whom his suspicions really rested. But who
      can tell the schemes that are in his mind? Perhaps he is only hesitating
      as to what fate he shall give his mother; he hates her, you know. He said
      a few words about it to his wife; she repeated them to Madame de Fiesque,
      and Madame de Fiesque told the queen-mother. Since then the king has kept
      away from his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; said Charles de Gondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; asked the marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To lay hold of the king&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; replied the Grand-master, who, if he was
      not so much in the queen&rsquo;s confidence as his brother, was by no means less
      clear-sighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, I have opened a great career to you,&rdquo; said his brother gravely.
      &ldquo;If you wish to be a duke also, be, as I am, the accomplice and cat&rsquo;s-paw
      of our mistress; she is the strongest here, and she will continue in
      power. Madame de Sauves is on her side, and the king of Navarre and the
      Duc d&rsquo;Alencon are still for Madame de Sauves. Catherine holds the pair in
      a leash under Charles IX., and she will hold them in future under Henri
      III. God grant that Henri may not prove ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother is doing too much for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! what noise is that I hear in the rue Saint-Honore?&rdquo; cried the
      Grand-master. &ldquo;Listen! there is some one at Rene&rsquo;s door! Don&rsquo;t you hear
      the footsteps of many men. Can they have arrested the Ruggieri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>diavolo</i>! this is prudence indeed. The king has not shown his
      usual impetuosity. But where will they imprison them? Let us go down into
      the street and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers reached the corner of the rue de l&rsquo;Autruche just as the
      king was entering the house of his mistress, Marie Touchet. By the light
      of the torches which the concierge carried, they distinguished Tavannes
      and the two Ruggieri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Tavannes!&rdquo; cried the grand-master, running after the king&rsquo;s
      companion, who had turned and was making his way back to the Louvre, &ldquo;What
      happened to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fell into a nest of sorcerers and arrested two, compatriots of yours,
      who may perhaps be able to explain to the minds of French gentlemen how
      you, who are not Frenchmen, have managed to lay hands on two of the chief
      offices of the Crown,&rdquo; replied Tavannes, half jesting, half in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king?&rdquo; inquired the Grand-master, who cared little for Tavanne&rsquo;s
      enmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stays with his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We reached our present distinction through an absolute devotion to our
      masters,&mdash;a noble course, my dear Tavannes, which I see that you also
      have adopted,&rdquo; replied Albert de Gondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three courtiers walked on in silence. At the moment when they parted,
      on meeting their servants who then escorted them, two men glided swiftly
      along the walls of the rue de l&rsquo;Autruche. These men were the king and the
      Comte de Solern, who soon reached the banks of the Seine, at a point where
      a boat and two rowers, carefully selected by de Solern, awaited them. In a
      very few moments they reached the other shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother has not gone to bed,&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;She will see us; we
      chose a bad place for the interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will think it a duel,&rdquo; replied Solern; &ldquo;and she cannot possibly
      distinguish who we are at this distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her see me!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles IX. &ldquo;I am resolved now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king and his confidant sprang ashore and walked quickly in the
      direction of the Pre-aux-Clercs. When they reached it the Comte de Solern,
      preceding the king, met a man who was evidently on the watch, and with
      whom he exchanged a few words; the man then retired to a distance.
      Presently two other men, who seemed to be princes by the marks of respect
      which the first man paid to them, left the place where they were evidently
      hiding behind the broken fence of a field, and approached the king, to
      whom they bent the knee. But Charles IX. raised them before they touched
      the ground, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ceremony, we are all gentlemen here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A venerable old man, who might have been taken for the Chancelier de
      l&rsquo;Hopital, had the latter not died in the preceding year, now joined the
      three gentlemen, all four walking rapidly so as to reach a spot where
      their conference could not be overheard by their attendants. The Comte de
      Solern followed at a slight distance to keep watch over the king. That
      faithful servant was filled with a distrust not shared by Charles IX., a
      man to whom life was now a burden. He was the only person on the king&rsquo;s
      side who witnessed this mysterious conference, which presently became
      animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said one of the new-comers, &ldquo;the Connetable de Montmorency, the
      closest friend of the king your father, agreed with the Marechal de
      Saint-Andre in declaring that Madame Catherine ought to be sewn up in a
      sack and flung into the river. If that had been done then, many worthy
      persons would still be alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have enough executions on my conscience, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire,&rdquo; said the youngest of the four personages, &ldquo;if you merely
      banish her, from the depths of her exile Queen Catherine will continue to
      stir up strife, and to find auxiliaries. We have everything to fear from
      the Guises, who, for the last nine years, have schemed for a vast Catholic
      alliance, in the secret of which your Majesty is not included; and it
      threatens your throne. This alliance was invented by Spain, which will
      never renounce its project of destroying the boundary of the Pyrenees.
      Sire, Calvinism will save France by setting up a moral barrier between her
      and a nation which covets the empire of the world. If the queen-mother is
      exiled, she will turn for help to Spain and to the Guises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;know this, if by your help peace without
      distrust is once established, I will take upon myself the duty of making
      all subjects tremble. <i>Tete-Dieu</i>! it is time indeed for royalty to
      assert itself. My mother is right in that, at any rate. You ought to know
      that it is to your interest was well as mine, for your hands, your
      fortunes depend upon our throne. If religion is overthrown, the hands you
      allow to do it will be laid next upon the throne and then upon you. I no
      longer care to fight ideas with weapons that cannot touch them. Let us see
      now if Protestantism will make progress when left to itself; above all, I
      would like to see with whom and what the spirit of that faction will
      wrestle. The admiral, God rest his soul! was not my enemy; he swore to me
      to restrain the revolt within spiritual limits, and to leave the ruling of
      the kingdom to the monarch, his master, with submissive subjects.
      Gentlemen, if the matter be still within your power, set that example now;
      help your sovereign to put down a spirit of rebellion which takes
      tranquillity from each and all of us. War is depriving us of revenue; it
      is ruining the kingdom. I am weary of these constant troubles; so weary,
      that if it is absolutely necessary I will sacrifice my mother. Nay, I will
      go farther; I will keep an equal number of Protestants and Catholics about
      me, and I will hold the axe of Louis XI. above their heads to force them
      to be on good terms. If the Messieurs de Guise plot a Holy Alliance to
      attack our crown, the executioner shall begin with their heads. I see the
      miseries of my people, and I will make short work of the great lords who
      care little for consciences,&mdash;let them hold what opinions they like;
      what I want in future is submissive subjects, who will work, according to
      my will, for the prosperity of the State. Gentlemen, I give you ten days
      to negotiate with your friends, to break off your plots, and to return to
      me who will be your father. If you refuse you will see great changes. I
      shall use the mass of the people, who will rise at my voice against the
      lords. I will make myself a king who pacificates his kingdom by striking
      down those who are more powerful even than you, and who dare defy him. If
      the troops fail me, I have my brother of Spain, on whom I shall call to
      defend our menaced thrones, and if I lack a minister to carry out my will,
      he can lend me the Duke of Alba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in that case, sire, we should have Germans to oppose to your
      Spaniards,&rdquo; said one of his hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; replied Charles IX., coldly, &ldquo;my wife&rsquo;s name is Elizabeth of
      Austria; support might fail you on the German side. But, for Heaven&rsquo;s
      sake, let us fight, if fight we must, alone, without the help of
      foreigners. You are the object of my mother&rsquo;s hatred, and you stand near
      enough to me to be my second in the duel I am about to fight with her;
      well then, listen to what I now say. You seem to me so worthy of
      confidence that I offer you the post of <i>connetable</i>; <i>you</i> will
      not betray me like the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince to whom Charles IX. had addressed himself, struck his hand into
      that of the king, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ventre-saint-gris</i>! brother; this is enough to make me forget many
      wrongs. But, sire, the head cannot march without the tail, and ours is a
      long tail to drag. Give me more than ten days; we want at least a month to
      make our friends hear reason. At the end of that time we shall be
      masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month, so be it! My only negotiator will be Villeroy; trust no one
      else, no matter what is said to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One month,&rdquo; echoed the other seigneurs, &ldquo;that is sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, we are five,&rdquo; said the king,&mdash;&ldquo;five men of honor. If any
      betrayal takes place, we shall know on whom to avenge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three strangers kissed the hand of Charles IX. and took leave of him
      with every mark of the utmost respect. As the king recrossed the Seine,
      four o&rsquo;clock was ringing from the clock-tower of the Louvre. Lights were
      on in the queen-mother&rsquo;s room; she had not yet gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother is still on the watch,&rdquo; said Charles to the Comte de Solern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has her forge as you have yours,&rdquo; remarked the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear count, what do you think of a king who is reduced to become a
      conspirator?&rdquo; said Charles IX., bitterly, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sire, that if you would allow me to fling that woman into the
      river, as your young cousin said, France would soon be at peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a parricide in addition to the Saint-Bartholomew, count?&rdquo; cried the
      king. &ldquo;No, no! I will exile her. Once fallen, my mother will no longer
      have either servants or partisans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sire,&rdquo; replied the Comte de Solern, &ldquo;give me the order to
      arrest her at once and take her out of the kingdom; for to-morrow she will
      have forced you to change your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my forge,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;no one can overhear us there; besides,
      I don&rsquo;t want my mother to suspect the capture of the Ruggieri. If she
      knows I am in my work-shop she&rsquo;ll suppose nothing, and we can consult
      about the proper measures for her arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the king entered a lower room of the palace, which he used for a
      workshop, he called his companion&rsquo;s attention to the forge and his
      implements with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;among all the kings that France will ever
      have, there&rsquo;ll be another to take pleasure in such work as that. But when
      I am really king, I&rsquo;ll forge no swords; they shall all go back into their
      scabbards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the Comte de Solern, &ldquo;the fatigues of tennis and hunting,
      your toil at this forge, and&mdash;if I may say it&mdash;love, are
      chariots which the devil is offering you to get the faster to
      Saint-Denis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solern,&rdquo; said the king, in a piteous tone, &ldquo;if you knew the fire they
      have put into my soul and body! nothing can quench it. Are you sure of the
      men who are guarding the Ruggieri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then, during this coming day I shall take my own course. Think
      of the proper means of making the arrest, and I will give you my final
      orders by five o&rsquo;clock at Madame de Belleville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the first rays of dawn were struggling with the lights of the workshop,
      Charles IX., left alone by the departure of the Comte de Solern, heard the
      door of the apartment turn on its hinges, and saw his mother standing
      within it in the dim light like a phantom. Though very nervous and
      impressible, the king did not quiver, albeit, under the circumstances in
      which he then stood, this apparition had a certain air of mystery and
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are killing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fulfilling my horoscope,&rdquo; he replied with a bitter smile. &ldquo;But you,
      madame, you appear to be as early as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have both been up all night, monsieur; but with very different
      intentions. While you have been conferring with your worst enemies in the
      open fields, concealing your acts from your mother, assisted by Tavannes
      and the Gondis, with whom you have been scouring the town, I have been
      reading despatches which contained the proofs of a terrible conspiracy in
      which your brother, the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, your brother-in-law, the king of
      Navarre, the Prince de Conde, and half the nobles of your kingdom are
      taking part. Their purpose is nothing less than to take the crown from
      your head and seize your person. Those gentlemen have already fifty
      thousand good troops behind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother has turned Huguenot,&rdquo; she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother! gone over to the Huguenots!&rdquo; cried Charles, brandishing the
      piece of iron which he held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon, Huguenot at heart, will soon be one before the
      eyes of the world. Your sister, the queen of Navarre, has almost ceased to
      love you; she cares more for the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon; she cares of Bussy; and
      she loves that little La Mole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a heart!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little La Mole,&rdquo; went on the queen, &ldquo;wishes to make himself a great
      man by giving France a king of his own stripe. He is promised, they say,
      the place of connetable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse that Margot!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;This is what comes of her marriage
      with a heretic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heretic or not is of no consequence; the trouble is that, in spite of my
      advice, you have brought the head of the younger branch too near the
      throne by that marriage, and Henri&rsquo;s purpose is now to embroil you with
      the rest and make you kill one another. The house of Bourbon is the enemy
      of the house of Valois; remember that, monsieur. All younger branches
      should be kept in a state of poverty, for they are born conspirators. It
      is sheer folly to give them arms when they have none, or to leave them in
      possession of arms when they seize them. Let every younger son be made
      incapable of doing harm; that is the law of Crowns; the Sultans of Asia
      follow it. The proofs of this conspiracy are in my room upstairs, where I
      asked you to follow me last evening, when you bade me good-night; but
      instead of doing so, it seems you had other plans. I therefore waited for
      you. If we do not take the proper measures immediately you will meet the
      fate of Charles the Simple within a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, thunderstruck at the coincidence of that
      period with the delay asked for by the princes themselves. &ldquo;&lsquo;In a month we
      shall be masters,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added to himself, quoting their words. &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he
      said aloud, &ldquo;what are your proofs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are unanswerable, monsieur; they come from my daughter Marguerite.
      Alarmed herself at the possibilities of such a combination, her love for
      the throne of the Valois has proved stronger, this time, than all her
      other loves. She asks, as the price of her revelations that nothing shall
      be done to La Mole; but the scoundrel seems to me a dangerous villain whom
      we had better be rid of, as well as the Comte de Coconnas, your brother
      d&rsquo;Alencon&rsquo;s right hand. As for the Prince de Conde, he consents to
      everything, provided I am thrown into the sea; perhaps that is the wedding
      present he gives me in return for the pretty wife I gave him! All this is
      a serious matter, monsieur. You talk of horoscopes! I know of the
      prediction which gives the throne of the Valois to the Bourbons, and if we
      do not take care it will be fulfilled. Do not be angry with your sister;
      she has behaved well in this affair. My son,&rdquo; continued the queen, after a
      pause, giving a tone of tenderness to her words, &ldquo;evil persons on the side
      of the Guises are trying to sow dissensions between you and me; and yet we
      are the only ones in the kingdom whose interests are absolutely identical.
      You blame me, I know, for the Saint-Bartholomew; you accuse me of having
      forced you into it. Catholicism, monsieur, must be the bond between
      France, Spain, and Italy, three countries which can, by skilful
      management, secretly planned, be united in course of time, under the house
      of Valois. Do not deprive yourself of such chances by loosing the cord
      which binds the three kingdoms in the bonds of a common faith. Why should
      not the Valois and the Medici carry out for their own glory the scheme of
      Charles the Fifth, whose head failed him? Let us fling off that race of
      Jeanne la Folle. The Medici, masters of Florence and of Rome, will force
      Italy to support your interests; they will guarantee you advantages by
      treaties of commerce and alliance which shall recognize your fiefs in
      Piedmont, the Milanais, and Naples, where you have rights. These,
      monsieur, are the reasons of the war to the death which we make against
      the Huguenots. Why do you force me to repeat these things? Charlemagne was
      wrong in advancing toward the north. France is a body whose heart is on
      the Gulf of Lyons, and its two arms over Spain and Italy. Therefore, she
      must rule the Mediterranean, that basket into which are poured all the
      riches of the Orient, now turned to the profit of those seigneurs of
      Venice, in the very teeth of Philip II. If the friendship of the Medici
      and your rights justify you in hoping for Italy, force, alliances, or a
      possible inheritance may give you Spain. Warn the house of Austria as to
      this,&mdash;that ambitious house to which the Guelphs sold Italy, and
      which is even now hankering after Spain. Though your wife is of that
      house, humble it! Clasp it so closely that you will smother it! <i>There</i>
      are the enemies of your kingdom; thence comes help to the Reformers. Do
      not listen to those who find their profit in causing us to disagree, and
      who torment your life by making you believe I am your secret enemy. Have
      <i>I</i> prevented you from having heirs? Why has your mistress given you
      a son, and your wife a daughter? Why have you not to-day three legitimate
      heirs to root out the hopes of these seditious persons? Is it I, monsieur,
      who am responsible for such failures? If you had an heir, would the Duc
      d&rsquo;Alencon be now conspiring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she ended these words, Catherine fixed upon her son the magnetic glance
      of a bird of prey upon its victim. The daughter of the Medici became
      magnificent; her real self shone upon her face, which, like that of a
      gambler over the green table, glittered with vast cupidities. Charles IX.
      saw no longer the mother of one man, but (as was said of her) the mother
      of armies and of empires,&mdash;<i>mater castrorum</i>. Catherine had now
      spread wide the wings of her genius, and boldly flown to the heights of
      the Medici and Valois policy, tracing once more the mighty plans which
      terrified in earlier days her husband Henri II., and which, transmitted by
      the genius of the Medici to Richelieu, remain in writing among the papers
      of the house of Bourbon. But Charles IX., hearing the unusual persuasions
      his mother was using, thought that there must be some necessity for them,
      and he began to ask himself what could be her motive. He dropped his eyes;
      he hesitated; his distrust was not lessened by her studied phrases.
      Catherine was amazed at the depths of suspicion she now beheld in her
      son&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you not understand me? What are we, you
      and I, in comparison with the eternity of royal crowns? Do you suppose me
      to have other designs than those that ought to actuate all royal persons
      who inhabit the sphere where empires are ruled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I will follow you to your cabinet; we must act&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Act!&rdquo; cried Catherine; &ldquo;let our enemies alone; let <i>them</i> act; take
      them red-handed, and law and justice will deliver you from their assaults.
      For God&rsquo;s sake, monsieur, show them good-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen withdrew; the king remained alone for a few moments, for he was
      utterly overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On which side is the trap?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Which of the two&mdash;she or
      they&mdash;deceive me? What is my best policy? <i>Deus, discerne causam
      meam</i>!&rdquo; he muttered with tears in his eyes. &ldquo;Life is a burden to me! I
      prefer death, natural or violent, to these perpetual torments!&rdquo; he cried
      presently, bringing down his hammer upon the anvil with such force that
      the vaults of the palace trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said, as he went outside and looked up at the sky, &ldquo;thou for
      whose holy religion I struggle, give me the light of thy countenance that
      I may penetrate the secrets of my mother&rsquo;s heart while I question the
      Ruggieri.&rdquo;

      III. MARIE TOUCHET
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little house of Madame de Belleville, where Charles IX. had deposited
      his prisoners, was the last but one in the rue de l&rsquo;Autruche on the side
      of the rue Saint-Honore. The street gate, flanked by two little brick
      pavilions, seemed very simple in those days, when gates and their
      accessories were so elaborately treated. It had two pilasters of stone cut
      in facets, and the coping represented a reclining woman holding a
      cornucopia. The gate itself, closed by enormous locks, had a wicket
      through which to examine those who asked admittance. In each pavilion
      lived a porter; for the king&rsquo;s extremely capricious pleasure required a
      porter by day and by night. The house had a little courtyard, paved like
      those of Venice. At this period, before carriages were invented, ladies
      went about on horseback, or in litters, so that courtyards could be made
      magnificent without fear of injury from horses or carriages. This fact is
      always to be remembered as an explanation of the narrowness of streets,
      the small size of courtyards, and certain other details of the private
      dwellings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, of one story only above the ground-floor, was capped by a
      sculptured frieze, above which rose a roof with four sides, the peak being
      flattened to form a platform. Dormer windows were cut in this roof, with
      casings and pediments which the chisel of some great artist had covered
      with arabesques and dentils; each of the three windows on the main floor
      were equally beautiful in stone embroidery, which the brick of the walls
      showed off to great advantage. On the ground-floor, a double portico, very
      delicately decorated, led to the entrance door, which was covered with
      bosses cut with facets in the Venetian manner,&mdash;a style of decoration
      which was further carried on round the windows placed to right and left of
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A garden, carefully laid out in the fashion of the times and filled with
      choice flowers, occupied a space behind the house equal to that of the
      courtyard in front. A grape-vine draped its walls. In the centre of a
      grass plot rose a silver fir-tree. The flower-borders were separated from
      the grass by meandering paths which led to an arbor of clipped yews at the
      farther end of the little garden. The walls were covered with a mosaic of
      variously colored pebbles, coarse in design, it is true, but pleasing to
      the eye from the harmony of its tints with those of the flower-beds. The
      house had a carved balcony on the garden side, above the door, and also on
      the front toward the courtyard, and around the middle windows. On both
      sides of the house the ornamentation of the principal window, which
      projected some feet from the wall, rose to the frieze; so that it formed a
      little pavilion, hung there like a lantern. The casings of the other
      windows were inlaid on the stone with precious marbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the exquisite taste displayed in the little house, there was
      an air of melancholy about it. It was darkened by the buildings that
      surrounded it and by the roofs of the hotel d&rsquo;Alencon which threw a heavy
      shadow over both court and garden; moreover, a deep silence reigned there.
      But this silence, these half-lights, this solitude, soothed a royal soul,
      which could there surrender itself to a single emotion, as in a cloister
      where men pray, or in some sheltered home wherein they love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy now to imagine the interior charm and choiceness of this haven,
      the sole spot in his kingdom where this dying Valois could pour out his
      soul, reveal his sufferings, exercise his taste for art, and give himself
      up to the poesy he loved,&mdash;pleasures denied him by the cares of a
      cruel royalty. Here, alone, were his great soul and his high intrinsic
      worth appreciated; here he could give himself up, for a few brief months,
      the last of his life, to the joys of fatherhood,&mdash;pleasures into
      which he flung himself with the frenzy that a sense of his coming and
      dreadful death impressed on all his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon of the day succeeding the night-scene we have just
      described, Marie Touchet was finishing her toilet in the oratory, which
      was the boudoir of those days. She was arranging the long curls of her
      beautiful black hair, blending them with the velvet of a new coif, and
      gazing intently into her mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nearly four o&rsquo;clock; that interminable council must surely be
      over,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;Jacob has returned from the Louvre; he
      says that everybody he saw was excited about the number of the councillors
      summoned and the length of the session. What can have happened? Is it some
      misfortune? Good God! surely <i>he</i> knows how suspense wears out the
      soul! Perhaps he has gone a-hunting? If he is happy and amused, it is all
      right. When I see him gay, I forget all I have suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hands round her slender waist as if to smooth some trifling
      wrinkle in her gown, turning sideways to see if its folds fell properly,
      and as she did so, she caught sight of the king on the couch behind her.
      The carpet had so muffled the sound of his steps that he had slipped in
      softly without being heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frightened me!&rdquo; she said, with a cry of surprise, which was quickly
      repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you thinking of me?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do I not think of you?&rdquo; she answered, sitting down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off his cap and cloak, passing her hands through his hair as
      though she combed it with her fingers. Charles let her do as she pleased,
      but made no answer. Surprised at this, Marie knelt down to study the pale
      face of her royal master, and then saw the signs of a dreadful weariness
      and a more consummate melancholy than any she had yet consoled. She
      repressed her tears and kept silence, that she might not irritate by
      mistaken words the sorrow which, as yet, she did not understand. In this
      she did as tender women do under like circumstances. She kissed that
      forehead, seamed with untimely wrinkles, and those livid cheeks, trying to
      convey to the worn-out soul the freshness of hers,&mdash;pouring her
      spirit into the sweet caresses which met with no response. Presently she
      raised her head to the level of the king&rsquo;s, clasping him softly in her
      arms; then she lay still, her face hidden on that suffering breast,
      watching for the opportune moment to question his dejected mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Charlot,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;will you not tell your poor, distressed
      Marie the troubles that cloud that precious brow, and whiten those
      beautiful red lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Charlemagne,&rdquo; he said in a hollow voice, &ldquo;all the kings of France
      named Charles have ended miserably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;look at Charles VIII.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor prince!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;In the flower of his age he
      struck his head against a low door at the chateau of Amboise, which he was
      having decorated, and died in horrible agony. It was his death which gave
      the crown to our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles VII. reconquered his kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, he died&rdquo; (the king lowered his voice) &ldquo;of hunger; for he feared
      being poisoned by the dauphin, who had already caused the death of his
      beautiful Agnes. The father feared his son; to-day the son dreads his
      mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why drag up the past?&rdquo; she said hastily, remembering the dreadful life of
      Charles VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sweetest, kings have no need to go to sorcerers to discover their
      coming fate; they need only turn to history. I am at this moment
      endeavoring to escape the fate of Charles the Simple, who was robbed of
      his crown, and died in prison after seven years&rsquo; captivity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles V. conquered the English,&rdquo; she cried triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not he, but du Guesclin. He himself, poisoned by Charles de Navarre,
      dragged out a wretched existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Charles IV., then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He married three times to obtain an heir, in spite of the masculine
      beauty of the children of Philippe le Bel. The first house of Valois ended
      with him, and the second is about to end in the same way. The queen has
      given me only a daughter, and I shall die without leaving her pregnant;
      for a long minority would be the greatest curse I could bequeath to the
      kingdom. Besides, if I had a son, would he live? The name of Charles is
      fatal; Charlemagne exhausted the luck of it. If I left a son I would
      tremble at the thought that he would be Charles X.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it that wants to seize your crown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother d&rsquo;Alencon conspires against it. Enemies are all about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Marie, with a charming little pout, &ldquo;do tell me something
      gayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my little jewel, my treasure, don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;monsieur,&rsquo; even in jest;
      you remind me of my mother, who stabs me incessantly with that title, by
      which she seems to snatch away my crown. She says &lsquo;my son&rsquo; to the Duc
      d&rsquo;Anjou&mdash;I mean the king of Poland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; exclaimed Marie, clasping her hands as though she were praying,
      &ldquo;there is a kingdom where you are worshipped. Your Majesty fills it with
      his glory, his power; and there the word &lsquo;monsieur,&rsquo; means &lsquo;my beloved
      lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She unclasped her hands, and with a pretty gesture pointed to her heart.
      The words were so <i>musiques</i> (to use a word of the times which
      depicted the melodies of love) that Charles IX. caught her round the waist
      with the nervous force that characterized him, and seated her on his knee,
      rubbing his forehead gently against the pretty curls so coquettishly
      arranged. Marie thought the moment favorable; she ventured a few kisses,
      which Charles allowed rather than accepted, then she said softly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my servants were not mistaken you were out all night in the streets,
      as in the days when you played the pranks of a younger son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the king, still lost in his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you fight the watchman and frighten some of the burghers? Who are the
      men you brought here and locked up? They must be very criminal, as you
      won&rsquo;t allow any communication with them. No girl was ever locked in as
      carefully, and they have not had a mouthful to eat since they came. The
      Germans whom Solern left to guard them won&rsquo;t let any one go near the room.
      Is it a joke you are playing; or is it something serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; said the king, coming out of his reverie, &ldquo;last
      night I did scour the roofs with Tavannes and the Gondis. I wanted to try
      my old follies with the old companions; but my legs were not what they
      once were; I did not dare leap the streets; though we did jump two alleys
      from one roof to the next. At the second, however, Tavannes and I, holding
      on to a chimney, agreed that we couldn&rsquo;t do it again. If either of us had
      been alone we couldn&rsquo;t have done it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager that you sprang first.&rdquo; The king smiled. &ldquo;I know why you risk
      your life in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, you little witch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sorceress! But I am being hunted down by sorcery,&rdquo; said the king,
      resuming his anxious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sorcery is love,&rdquo; she replied, smiling. &ldquo;Since the happy day when you
      first loved me, have I not always divined your thoughts? And&mdash;if you
      will let me speak the truth&mdash;the thoughts which torture you to-day
      are not worthy of a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a king?&rdquo; he said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you be one? What did Charles VII. do? He listened to his mistress,
      monseigneur, and he reconquered his kingdom, invaded by the English as
      yours is now by the enemies of our religion. Your last <i>coup d&rsquo;Etat</i>
      showed you the course you have to follow. Exterminate heresy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You blamed the Saint-Bartholomew,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;and now you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is over,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;besides, I agree with Madame Catherine that it
      was better to do it yourselves than let the Guises do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles VII. had only men to fight; I am face to face with ideas,&rdquo;
       resumed the king. &ldquo;We can kill men, but we can&rsquo;t kill words! The Emperor
      Charles V. gave up the attempt; his son Philip has spent his strength upon
      it; we shall all perish, we kings, in that struggle. On whom can I rely?
      To right, among the Catholics, I find the Guises, who are my enemies; to
      left, the Calvinists, who will never forgive me the death of my poor old
      Coligny, nor that bloody day in August; besides, they want to suppress the
      throne; and in front of me what have I?&mdash;my mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest her; reign alone,&rdquo; said Marie in a low voice, whispering in his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to do so yesterday; to-day I no longer intend it. You speak of it
      rather coolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the daughter of an apothecary and that of a doctor there is no
      great difference,&rdquo; replied Touchet, always ready to laugh at the false
      origin attributed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, don&rsquo;t take such liberties. Catherine de&rsquo; Medici is my mother, and
      you ought to tremble lest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; cried the king, beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; cried Marie, restraining her tears; for the sight of such
      strength united to such weakness touched her deeply. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;you make me hate Madame Catherine, who has been so good to me; her
      kindness now seems perfidy. Why is she so kind to me, and bad to you?
      During my stay in Dauphine I heard many things about the beginning of your
      reign which you concealed from me; it seems to me that the queen, your
      mother, is the real cause of all your troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; cried the king, deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women whose souls and whose intentions are pure use virtue wherewith to
      rule the men they love; but women who do not seek good rule men through
      their evil instincts. Now, the queen made vices out of certain of your
      noblest qualities, and she taught you to believe that your worst
      inclinations were virtues. Was that the part of a mother? Be a tyrant like
      Louis XI.; inspire terror; imitate Philip II.; banish the Italians; drive
      out the Guises; confiscate the lands of the Calvinists. Out of this
      solitude you will rise a king; you will save the throne. The moment is
      propitious; your brother is in Poland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are two children at statecraft,&rdquo; said Charles, bitterly; &ldquo;we know
      nothing except how to love. Alas! my treasure, yesterday I, too, thought
      all these things; I dreamed of accomplishing great deeds&mdash;bah! my
      mother blew down my house of cards! From a distance we see great questions
      outlined like the summits of mountains, and it is easy to say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make
      an end of Calvinism; I&rsquo;ll bring those Guises to task; I&rsquo;ll separate from
      the Court of Rome; I&rsquo;ll rely upon my people, upon the burghers&mdash;&rsquo; ah!
      yes, from afar it all seems simple enough! but try to climb those
      mountains and the higher you go the more the difficulties appear.
      Calvinism, in itself, is the last thing the leaders of that party care
      for; and the Guises, those rabid Catholics, would be sorry indeed to see
      the Calvinists put down. Each side considers its own interests
      exclusively, and religious opinions are but a cloak for insatiable
      ambition. The party of Charles IX. is the feeblest of all. That of the
      king of Navarre, that of the king of Poland, that of the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon,
      that of the Condes, that of the Guises, that of my mother, are all
      intriguing one against another, but they take no account of me, not even
      in my own council. My mother, in the midst of so many contending elements,
      is, nevertheless, the strongest among them; she has just proved to me the
      inanity of my plans. We are surrounded by rebellious subjects who defy the
      law. The axe of Louis XI. of which you speak, is lacking to us. Parliament
      would not condemn the Guises, nor the king of Navarre, nor the Condes, nor
      my brother. No! the courage to assassinate is needed; the throne will be
      forced to strike down those insolent men who suppress both law and
      justice; but where can we find the faithful arm? The council I held this
      morning has disgusted me with everything; treason everywhere; contending
      interests all about me. I am tired with the burden of my crown. I only
      want to die in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped into a sort of gloomy somnolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusted with everything!&rdquo; repeated Marie Touchet, sadly; but she did
      not disturb the black torpor of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was the victim of a complete prostration of mind and body,
      produced by three things,&mdash;the exhaustion of all his faculties,
      aggravated by the disheartenment of realizing the extent of an evil; the
      recognized impossibility of surmounting his weakness; and the aspect of
      difficulties so great that genius itself would dread them. The king&rsquo;s
      depression was in proportion to the courage and the loftiness of ideas to
      which he had risen during the last few months. In addition to this, an
      attack of nervous melancholy, caused by his malady, had seized him as he
      left the protracted council which had taken place in his private cabinet.
      Marie saw that he was in one of those crises when the least word, even of
      love, would be importunate and painful; so she remained kneeling quietly
      beside him, her head on his knee, the king&rsquo;s hand buried in her hair, and
      he himself motionless, without a word, without a sigh, as still as Marie
      herself,&mdash;Charles IX. in the lethargy of impotence, Marie in the
      stupor of despair which comes to a loving woman when she perceives the
      boundaries at which love ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers thus remained, in the deepest silence, during one of those
      terrible hours when all reflection wounds, when the clouds of an inward
      tempest veil even the memory of happiness. Marie believed that she herself
      was partly the cause of this frightful dejection. She asked herself, not
      without horror, if the excessive joys and the violent love which she had
      never yet found strength to resist, did not contribute to weaken the mind
      and body of the king. As she raised her eyes, bathed in tears, toward her
      lover, she saw the slow tears rolling down his pallid cheeks. This mark of
      the sympathy that united them so moved the king that he rushed from his
      depression like a spurred horse. He took Marie in his arms and placed her
      on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will no longer be a king,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will be your lover, your lover
      only, wholly given up to that happiness. I will die happy, and not
      consumed by the cares and miseries of a throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of these words, the fire that shone in the half-extinct eyes of
      the king, gave Marie a terrible shock instead of happiness; she blamed her
      love as an accomplice in the malady of which the king was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile you forget your prisoners,&rdquo; she said, rising abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! what care I for them? I give them leave to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are they murderers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be frightened, little one; we hold them fast. Don&rsquo;t think of
      them, but of me. Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; he repeated, sparks darting from his eyes, so violent was the rush
      of his anger at the untimely respect of his mistress. &ldquo;You are in league
      with my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; cried Marie, looking at the picture above her <i>prie-dieu</i>
      and turning toward it to say her prayer, &ldquo;grant that he comprehend me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the king suspiciously, &ldquo;you have some wrong to me upon your
      conscience!&rdquo; Then looking at her from between his arms, he plunged his
      eyes into hers. &ldquo;I have heard some talk of the mad passion of a certain
      Entragues,&rdquo; he went on wildly. &ldquo;Ever since their grandfather, the soldier
      Balzac, married a viscontessa at Milan that family hold their heads too
      high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie looked at the king with so proud an air that he was ashamed. At that
      instant the cries of little Charles de Valois, who had just awakened, were
      heard in the next room. Marie ran to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Bourguignonne!&rdquo; she said, taking the child from its nurse and
      carrying it to the king. &ldquo;You are more of a child than he,&rdquo; she cried,
      half angry, half appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is beautiful!&rdquo; said Charles IX., taking his son in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I alone know how like he is to you,&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;already he has your
      smile and your gestures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So tiny as that!&rdquo; said the king, laughing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know men don&rsquo;t believe such things; but watch him, my Charlot, play
      with him. Look there! See! Am I not right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, astonished by a motion of the child which
      seemed the very miniature of a gesture of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the pretty flower!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;Never shall he leave us! <i>He</i>
      will never cause me grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king frolicked with his son; he tossed him in his arms, and kissed him
      passionately, talking the foolish, unmeaning talk, the pretty, baby
      language invented by nurses and mothers. His voice grew child-like. At
      last his forehead cleared, joy returned to his saddened face, and then, as
      Marie saw that he had forgotten his troubles, she laid her head upon his
      shoulder and whispered in his ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me, Charlot, why you have made me keep murderers in my
      house? Who are these men, and what do you mean to do with them? In short,
      I want to know what you were doing on the roofs. I hope there was no woman
      in the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you love me as much as ever!&rdquo; cried the king, meeting the clear,
      interrogatory glance that women know so well how to cast upon occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubted <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she replied, as a tear shone on her beautiful
      eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are women in my adventure,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but they are
      sorceresses. How far had I told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were on the roofs near by&mdash;what street was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue Saint-Honore, sweetest,&rdquo; said the king, who seemed to have recovered
      himself. Collecting this thoughts, he began to explain to his mistress
      what had happened, as if to prepare her for a scene that was presently to
      take place in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was passing through the street last night on a frolic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      chanced to see a bright light from the dormer window of the house occupied
      by Rene, my mother&rsquo;s glover and perfumer, and once yours. I have strong
      doubts about that man and what goes on in his house. If I am poisoned, the
      drug will come from there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall dismiss him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so you kept him after I had given him up?&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;I thought
      my life was safe with you,&rdquo; he added gloomily; &ldquo;but no doubt death is
      following me even here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dearest, I have only just returned from Dauphine with our
      dauphin,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;and Rene has supplied me with nothing since
      the death of the Queen of Navarre. Go on; you climbed to the roof of
      Rene&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV. THE KING&rsquo;S TALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the king. &ldquo;In a second I was there, followed by Tavannes,
      and then we clambered to a spot where I could see without being seen the
      interior of that devil&rsquo;s kitchen, in which I beheld extraordinary things
      which inspired me to take certain measures. Did you ever notice the end of
      the roof of that cursed perfumer? The windows toward the street are always
      closed and dark, except the last, from which can be seen the hotel de
      Soissons and the observatory which my mother built for that astrologer,
      Cosmo Ruggiero. Under the roof are lodging-rooms and a gallery which have
      no windows except on the courtyard, so that in order to see what was going
      on within, it was necessary to go where no man before ever dreamed of
      climbing,&mdash;along the coping of a high wall which adjoins the roof of
      Rene&rsquo;s house. The men who set up in that house the furnaces by which they
      distil death, reckoned on the cowardice of Parisians to save them from
      being overlooked; but they little thought of Charles de Valois! I crept
      along the coping until I came to a window, against the casing of which I
      was able to stand up straight with my arm round a carved monkey which
      ornamented it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you see, dear heart?&rdquo; said Marie, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A den, where works of darkness were being done,&rdquo; replied the king. &ldquo;The
      first object on which my eyes lighted was a tall old man seated in a
      chair, with a magnificent white beard, like that of old l&rsquo;Hopital, and
      dressed like him in a black velvet robe. On his broad forehead furrowed
      deep with wrinkles, on his crown of white hair, on his calm, attentive
      face, pale with toil and vigils, fell the concentrated rays of a lamp from
      which shone a vivid light. His attention was divided between an old
      manuscript, the parchment of which must have been centuries old, and two
      lighted furnaces on which heretical compounds were cooking. Neither the
      floor nor the ceiling of the laboratory could be seen, because of the
      myriads of hanging skeletons, bodies of animals, dried plants, minerals,
      and articles of all kinds that masked the walls; while on the floor were
      books, instruments for distilling, chests filled with utensils for magic
      and astrology; in one place I saw horoscopes and nativities, phials,
      wax-figures under spells, and possibly poisons. Tavannes and I were
      fascinated, I do assure you, by the sight of this devil&rsquo;s-arsenal. Only to
      see it puts one under a spell, and if I had not been King of France, I
      might have been awed by it. &lsquo;You can tremble for both of us,&rsquo; I whispered
      to Tavannes. But Tavannes&rsquo; eyes were already caught by the most mysterious
      feature of the scene. On a couch, near the old man, lay a girl of
      strangest beauty,&mdash;slender and long like a snake, white as ermine,
      livid as death, motionless as a statue. Perhaps it was a woman just taken
      from her grave, on whom they were trying experiments, for she seemed to
      wear a shroud; her eyes were fixed, and I could not see that she breathed.
      The old fellow paid no attention to her. I looked at him so intently that,
      after a while, his soul seemed to pass into mine. By dint of studying him,
      I ended by admiring the glance of his eye,&mdash;so keen, so profound, so
      bold, in spite of the chilling power of age. I admired his mouth, mobile
      with thoughts emanating from a desire which seemed to be the solitary
      desire of his soul, and was stamped upon every line of the face. All
      things in that man expressed a hope which nothing discouraged, and nothing
      could check. His attitude,&mdash;a quivering immovability,&mdash;those
      outlines so free, carved by a single passion as by the chisel of a
      sculptor, that IDEA concentrated on some experiment criminal or
      scientific, that seeking Mind in quest of Nature, thwarted by her, bending
      but never broken under the weight of its own audacity, which it would not
      renounce, threatening creation with the fire it derived from it,&mdash;ah!
      all that held me in a spell for the time being. I saw before me an old man
      who was more of a king than I, for his glance embraced the world and
      mastered it. I will forge swords no longer; I will soar above the abysses
      of existence, like that man; for his science, methinks, is true royalty!
      Yes, I believe in occult science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, the eldest son, the defender of the Holy Catholic, Apostolic, and
      Roman Church?&rdquo; said Marie.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to you? Go on, go on; I will fear for you, and you will
      have courage for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking at a clock, the old man rose,&rdquo; continued the king. &ldquo;He went out,
      I don&rsquo;t know where; but I heard the window on the side toward the rue
      Saint-Honore open. Soon a brilliant light gleamed out upon the darkness;
      then I saw in the observatory of the hotel de Soissons another light
      replying to that of the old man, and by it I beheld the figure of Cosmo
      Ruggiero on the tower. &lsquo;See, they communicate!&rsquo; I said to Tavannes, who
      from that moment thought the matter frightfully suspicious, and agreed
      with me that we ought to seize the two men and search, incontinently,
      their accursed workshop. But before proceeding to do so, we wanted to see
      what was going to happen. After about fifteen minutes the door opened, and
      Cosmo Ruggiero, my mother&rsquo;s counsellor,&mdash;the bottomless pit which
      holds the secrets of the court, he from whom all women ask help against
      their husbands and lovers, and all the men ask help against their
      unfaithful wives and mistresses, he who traffics on the future as on the
      past, receiving pay with both hands, who sells horoscopes and is supposed
      to know all things,&mdash;that semi-devil came in, saying to the old man,
      &lsquo;Good-day to you, brother.&rsquo; With him he brought a hideous old woman,&mdash;toothless,
      humpbacked, twisted, bent, like a Chinese image, only worse. She was
      wrinkled as a withered apple; her skin was saffron-colored; her chin bit
      her nose; her mouth was a mere line scarcely visible; her eyes were like
      the black spots on a dice; her forehead emitted bitterness; her hair
      escaped in straggling gray locks from a dirty coif; she walked with a
      crutch; she smelt of heresy and witchcraft. The sight of her actually
      frightened us, Tavannes and me! We didn&rsquo;t think her a natural woman. God
      never made a woman so fearful as that. She sat down on a stool near the
      pretty snake with whom Tavannes was in love. The two brothers paid no
      attention to the old woman nor to the young woman, who together made a
      horrible couple,&mdash;on the one side life in death, on the other death
      in life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my sweet poet!&rdquo; cried Marie, kissing the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-day, Cosmo,&rsquo; replied the old alchemist. And they both looked into
      the furnace. &lsquo;What strength has the moon to-day?&rsquo; asked the elder. &lsquo;But,
      <i>caro Lorenzo</i>,&rsquo; replied my mother&rsquo;s astrologer, &lsquo;the September tides
      are not yet over; we can learn nothing while that disorder lasts.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
      says the East to-night?&rsquo; &lsquo;It discloses in the air a creative force which
      returns to earth all that earth takes from it. The conclusion is that all
      things here below are the product of a slow transformation, but that all
      diversities are the forms of one and the same substance.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is what my
      predecessor thought,&rsquo; replied Lorenzo. &lsquo;This morning Bernard Palissy told
      me that metals were the result of compression, and that fire, which
      divides all, also unites all; fire has the power to compress as well as to
      separate. That man has genius.&rsquo; Though I was placed where it was
      impossible for them to see me, Cosmo said, lifting the hand of the dead
      girl: &lsquo;Some one is near us! Who is it&rsquo; &lsquo;The king,&rsquo; she answered. I at once
      showed myself and rapped on the window. Ruggiero opened it, and I sprang
      into that hellish kitchen, followed by Tavannes. &lsquo;Yes, the king,&rsquo; I said
      to the two Florentines, who seemed terrified. &lsquo;In spite of your furnaces
      and your books, your sciences and your sorceries, you did not foresee my
      visit. I am very glad to meet the famous Lorenzo Ruggiero, of whom my
      mother speaks mysteriously,&rsquo; I said, addressing the old man, who rose and
      bowed. &lsquo;You are in this kingdom without my consent, my good man. For whom
      are you working here, you whose ancestors from father to son have been
      devoted in heart to the house of Medici? Listen to me! You dive into so
      many purses that by this time, if you are grasping men, you have piled up
      gold. You are too shrewd and cautious to cast yourselves imprudently into
      criminal actions; but, nevertheless, you are not here in this kitchen
      without a purpose. Yes, you have some secret scheme, you who are satisfied
      neither by gold nor power. Whom do you serve,&mdash;God or the devil? What
      are you concocting here? I choose to know the whole truth; I am a man who
      can hear it and keep silence about your enterprise, however blamable it
      maybe. Therefore you will tell me all, without reserve. If you deceive me
      you will be treated severely. Pagans or Christians, Calvinists or
      Mohammedans, you have my royal word that you shall leave the kingdom in
      safety if you have any misdemeanors to relate. I shall leave you for the
      rest of the night and the forenoon of to-morrow to examine your thoughts;
      for you are now my prisoners, and you will at once follow me to a place
      where you will be guarded carefully.&rsquo; Before obeying me the two Italians
      consulted each other by a subtle glance; then Lorenzo Ruggiero said I
      might be assured that no torture could wring their secrets from them; that
      in spite of their apparent feebleness neither pain nor human feelings had
      any power of them; confidence alone could make their mouth say what their
      mind contained. I must not, he said, be surprised if they treated as
      equals with a king who recognized God only as above him, for their
      thoughts came from God alone. They therefore claimed from me as much
      confidence and trust as they should give to me. But before engaging
      themselves to answer me without reserve they must request me to put my
      left hand into that of the young girl lying there, and my right into that
      of the old woman. Not wishing them to think I was afraid of their sorcery,
      I held out my hands; Lorenzo took the right, Cosmo the left, and each
      placed a hand in that of each woman, so that I was like Jesus Christ
      between the two thieves. During the time that the two witches were
      examining my hands Cosmo held a mirror before me and asked me to look into
      it; his brother, meanwhile, was talking with the two women in a language
      unknown to me. Neither Tavannes nor I could catch the meaning of a single
      sentence. Before bringing the men here we put seals on all the outlets of
      the laboratory, which Tavannes undertook to guard until such time as, by
      my express orders, Bernard Palissy, and Chapelain, my physician, could be
      brought there to examine thoroughly the drugs the place contained and
      which were evidently made there. In order to keep the Ruggieri ignorant of
      this search, and to prevent them from communicating with a single soul
      outside, I put the two devils in your lower rooms in charge of Solern&rsquo;s
      Germans, who are better than the walls of a jail. Rene, the perfumer, is
      kept under guard in his own house by Solern&rsquo;s equerry, and so are the two
      witches. Now, my sweetest, inasmuch as I hold the keys of the whole cabal,&mdash;the
      kings of Thune, the chiefs of sorcery, the gypsy fortune-tellers, the
      masters of the future, the heirs of all past soothsayers,&mdash;I intend
      by their means to read <i>you</i>, to know your heart; and, together, we
      will find out what is to happen to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad if they can lay my heart bare before you,&rdquo; said Marie,
      without the slightest fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why sorcerers don&rsquo;t frighten you,&mdash;because you are a witch
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a peach?&rdquo; she said, offering him some delicious fruit on a
      gold plate. &ldquo;See these grapes, these pears; I went to Vincennes myself and
      gathered them for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll eat them; there is no poison there except a philter from your
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to eat a great deal of fruit, Charles; it would cool your
      blood, which you heat by such excitements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I love you less?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If the things you love injure you&mdash;and I
      have feared it&mdash;I shall find strength in my heart to refuse them. I
      adore Charles more than I love the king; I want the man to live, released
      from the tortures that make him grieve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Royalty has ruined me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;If you were only a poor prince, like your
      brother-in-law of Navarre, without a penny, possessing only a miserable
      little kingdom in Spain where he never sets his foot, and Bearn in France
      which doesn&rsquo;t give him revenue enough to feed him, I should be happy, much
      happier than if I were really Queen of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are more than the Queen of France. She has King Charles for the
      sake of the kingdom only; royal marriages are only politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie smiled and made a pretty little grimace as she said: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I
      know that, sire. And my sonnet, have you written it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, verses are as difficult to write as treaties of peace; but you
      shall have them soon. Ah, me! life is so easy here, I wish I might never
      leave you. However, we must send for those Italians and question them. <i>Tete-Dieu</i>!
      I thought one Ruggiero in the kingdom was one too many, but it seems there
      are two. Now listen, my precious; you don&rsquo;t lack sense, you would make an
      excellent lieutenant of police, for you can penetrate things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire, we women suppose all we fear, and we turn what is probable
      into truths; that is the whole of our art in a nutshell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, help me to sound these men. Just now all my plans depend on the
      result of their examination. Are they innocent? Are they guilty? My mother
      is behind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear Jacob&rsquo;s voice in the next room,&rdquo; said Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob was the favorite valet of the king, and the one who accompanied him
      on all his private excursions. He now came to ask if it was the king&rsquo;s
      good pleasure to speak to the two prisoners. The king made a sign in the
      affirmative, and the mistress of the house gave her orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;clear the house of everybody, except the nurse and
      Monsieur le Dauphin d&rsquo;Auvergne, who may remain. As for you, stay in the
      lower hall; but first, close the windows, draw the curtains of the salon,
      and light the candles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s impatience was so great that while these preparations were
      being made he sat down upon a raised seat at the corner of a lofty
      fireplace of white marble in which a bright fire was blazing, placing his
      pretty mistress by his side. His portrait, framed in velvet, was over the
      mantle in place of a mirror. Charles IX. rested his elbow on the arm of
      the seat as if to watch the two Florentines the better under cover of his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shutters closed, and the curtains drawn, Jacob lighted the wax tapers
      in a tall candelabrum of chiselled silver, which he placed on the table
      where the Florentines were to stand,&mdash;an object, by the bye, which
      they would readily recognize as the work of their compatriot, Benvenuto
      Cellini. The richness of the room, decorated in the taste of Charles IX.,
      now shone forth. The red-brown of the tapestries showed to better
      advantage than by daylight. The various articles of furniture, delicately
      made or carved, reflected in their ebony panels the glow of the fire and
      the sparkle of the lights. Gilding, soberly applied, shone here and there
      like eyes, brightening the brown color which prevailed in this nest of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob presently gave two knocks, and, receiving permission, ushered in the
      Italians. Marie Touchet was instantly affected by the grandeur of
      Lorenzo&rsquo;s presence, which struck all those who met him, great and small
      alike. The silvery whiteness of the old man&rsquo;s beard was heightened by a
      robe of black velvet; his brow was like a marble dome. His austere face,
      illumined by two black eyes which cast a pointed flame, conveyed an
      impression of genius issuing from solitude, and all the more effective
      because its power had not been dulled by contact with men. It was like the
      steel of a blade that had never been fleshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Cosmo Ruggiero, he wore the dress of a courtier of the time. Marie
      made a sign to the king to assure him that he had not exaggerated his
      description, and to thank him for having shown her these extraordinary
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to have seen the sorceresses, too,&rdquo; she whispered in his
      ear.

    <p>
      Again absorbed in thought, Charles IX. made her no answer; he was idly
      flicking crumbs of bread from his doublet and breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your science cannot change the heavens or make the sun to shine,
      messieurs,&rdquo; he said at last, pointing to the curtains which the gray
      atmosphere of Paris darkened.

      &ldquo;Our science can make the skies what we like, sire,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo
      Ruggiero. &ldquo;The weather is always fine for those who work in a laboratory
      by the light of a furnace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; he added, using an
      expression familiar to him when addressing old men, &ldquo;explain to us clearly
      the object of your studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will guarantee our safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word of a king,&rdquo; replied Charles IX., whose curiosity was keenly
      excited by the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorenzo Ruggiero seemed to hesitate, and Charles IX. cried out: &ldquo;What
      hinders you? We are here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is the King of France here?&rdquo; asked Lorenzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles reflected an instant, and then answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The imposing old man then took a chair, and seated himself. Cosmo,
      astonished at this boldness, dared not imitate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles IX. remarked, with cutting sarcasm: &ldquo;The king is not here,
      monsieur, but a lady is, whose permission it was your duty to await.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He whom you see before you, madame,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;is as far above
      kings as kings are above their subjects; you will think me courteous when
      you know my powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these audacious words, with Italian emphasis, Charles and Marie
      looked at each other, and also at Cosmo, who, with his eyes fixed on his
      brother, seemed to be asking himself: &ldquo;How does he intend to get us out of
      the danger in which we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there was but one person present who could understand the
      boldness and the art of Lorenzo Ruggiero&rsquo;s first step; and that person was
      neither the king nor his young mistress, on whom that great seer had
      already flung the spell of his audacity,&mdash;it was Cosmo Ruggiero, his
      wily brother. Though superior himself to the ablest men at court, perhaps
      even to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici herself, the astrologer always recognized his
      brother Lorenzo as his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buried in studious solitude, the old savant weighed and estimated
      sovereigns, most of whom were worn out by the perpetual turmoil of
      politics, the crises of which at this period came so suddenly and were so
      keen, so intense, so unexpected. He knew their ennui, their lassitude,
      their disgust with things about them; he knew the ardor with which they
      sought what seemed to them new or strange or fantastic; above all, how
      they loved to enter some unknown intellectual region to escape their
      endless struggle with men and events. To those who have exhausted
      statecraft, nothing remains but the realm of pure thought. Charles the
      Fifth proved this by his abdication. Charles IX., who wrote sonnets and
      forged blades to escape the exhausting cares of an age in which both
      throne and king were threatened, to whom royalty had brought only cares
      and never pleasures, was likely to be roused to a high pitch of interest
      by the bold denial of his power thus uttered by Lorenzo. Religious doubt
      was not surprising in an age when Catholicism was so violently arraigned;
      but the upsetting of all religion, given as the basis of a strange,
      mysterious art, would surely strike the king&rsquo;s mind, and drag it from its
      present preoccupations. The essential thing for the two brothers was to
      make the king forget his suspicions by turning his mind to new ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ruggieri were well aware that their stake in this game was their own
      life, and the glances, so humble, and yet so proud, which they exchanged
      with the searching, suspicious eyes of Marie and the king, were a scene in
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Lorenzo Ruggiero, &ldquo;you have asked me for the truth; but, to
      show the truth in all her nakedness, I must also show you and make you
      sound the depths of the well from which she comes. I appeal to the
      gentleman and the poet to pardon words which the eldest son of the Church
      might take for blasphemy,&mdash;I believe that God does not concern
      himself with human affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though determined to maintain a kingly composure, Charles IX. could not
      repress a motion of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without that conviction I should have no faith whatever in the miraculous
      work to which my life is devoted. To do that work I must have this belief;
      and if the finger of God guides all things, then&mdash;I am a madman.
      Therefore, let the king understand, once for all, that this work means a
      victory to be won over the present course of Nature. I am an alchemist,
      sire. But do not think, as the common-minded do, that I seek to make gold.
      The making of gold is not the object but an incident of our researches;
      otherwise our toil could not be called the GREAT WORK. The Great Work is
      something far loftier than that. If, therefore, I were forced to admit the
      presence of God in matter, my voice must logically command the extinction
      of furnaces kept burning throughout the ages. But to deny the direct
      action of God in the world is not to deny God; do not make that mistake.
      We place the Creator of all things far higher than the sphere to which
      religions have degraded Him. Do not accuse of atheism those who look for
      immortality. Like Lucifer, we are jealous of our God; and jealousy means
      love. Though the doctrine of which I speak is the basis of our work, all
      our disciples are not imbued with it. Cosmo,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing
      to his brother, &ldquo;Cosmo is devout; he pays for masses for the repose of our
      father&rsquo;s soul, and he goes to hear them. Your mother&rsquo;s astrologer believes
      in the divinity of Christ, in the Immaculate Conception, in
      Transubstantiation; he believes also in the Pope&rsquo;s indulgences and in
      hell, and in a multitude of such things. His hour has not yet come. I have
      drawn his horoscope; he will live to be almost a centenarian; he will live
      through two more reigns, and he will see two kings of France
      assassinated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last of the Valois and the first of the Bourbons,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo.
      &ldquo;But Cosmo shares my opinion. It is impossible to be an alchemist and a
      Catholic, to have faith in the despotism of man over matter, and also in
      the sovereignty of the divine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cosmo to die a centenarian!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, with his terrible frown
      of the eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, with authority; &ldquo;and he will die peaceably
      in his bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have power to foresee the moment of your death, why are you
      ignorant of the outcome of your researches?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles IX. smiled as he said this, looking triumphantly at Marie Touchet.
      The brothers exchanged a rapid glance of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He begins to be interested,&rdquo; thought they. &ldquo;We are saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our prognostics depend on the immediate relations which exist at the time
      between man and Nature; but our purpose itself is to change those
      relations entirely,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if you are certain of dying you are certain of defeat,&rdquo; he said, at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like our predecessors,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, raising his hand and letting it
      fall again with an emphatic and solemn gesture, which presented visibly
      the grandeur of his thought. &ldquo;But your mind has bounded to the confines of
      the matter, sire; we must return upon our steps. If you do not know the
      ground on which our edifice is built, you may well think it doomed to
      crumble with our lives, and so judge the Science cultivated from century
      to century by the greatest among men, as the common herd judge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king made a sign of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; continued Lorenzo, &ldquo;that this earth belongs to man; he is the
      master of it, and he can appropriate to his use all forces and all
      substances. Man is not a creation issuing directly from the hand of God;
      but the development of a principle sown broadcast into the infinite of
      ether, from which millions of creatures are produced,&mdash;differing
      beings in different worlds, because the conditions surrounding life are
      varied. Yes, sire, the subtle element which we call <i>life</i> takes its
      rise beyond the visible worlds; creation divides that principle according
      to the centres into which it flows; and all beings, even the lowest, share
      it, taking so much as they can take of it at their own risk and peril. It
      is for them to protect themselves from death,&mdash;the whole purpose of
      alchemy lies there, sire. If man, the most perfect animal on this globe,
      bore within himself a portion of the divine, he would not die; but he does
      die. To solve this difficulty, Socrates and his school invented the Soul.
      I, the successor of so many great and unknown kings, the rulers of this
      science, I stand for the ancient theories, not the new. I believe in the
      transformations of matter which I see, and not in the possible eternity of
      a soul which I do not see. I do not recognize that world of the soul. If
      such a world existed, the substances whose magnificent conjunction
      produced your body, and are so dazzling in that of Madame, would not
      resolve themselves after your death each into its own element, water to
      water, fire to fire, metal to metal, just as the elements of my coal, when
      burned, return to their primitive molecules. If you believe that a certain
      part of us survives, <i>we</i> do not survive; for all that makes our
      actual being perishes. Now, it is this actual being that I am striving to
      continue beyond the limit assigned to life; it is our present
      transformation to which I wish to give a greater duration. Why! the trees
      live for centuries, but man lives only years, though the former are
      passive, the others active; the first motionless and speechless, the
      others gifted with language and motion. No created thing should be
      superior in this world to man, either in power or in duration. Already we
      are widening our perceptions, for we look into the stars; therefore we
      ought to be able to lengthen the duration of our lives. I place life
      before power. What good is power if life escapes us? A wise man should
      have no other purpose than to seek, not whether he has some other life
      within him, but the secret springs of his actual form, in order that he
      may prolong its existence at his will. That is the desire which has
      whitened my hair; but I walk boldly in the darkness, marshalling to the
      search all those great intellects that share my faith. Life will some day
      be ours,&mdash;ours to control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but how?&rdquo; cried the king, rising hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first condition of our faith being that the earth belongs to man, you
      must grant me that point,&rdquo; said Lorenzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; said Charles de Valois, already under the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sire, if we take God out of this world, what remains? Man. Let us
      therefore examine our domain. The material world is composed of elements;
      these elements are themselves principles; these principles resolve
      themselves into an ultimate principle, endowed with motion. The number
      THREE is the formula of creation: Matter, Motion, Product.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;what proof is there of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see the effects?&rdquo; replied Lorenzo. &ldquo;We have tried in our
      crucibles the acorn which produces the oak, and the embryo from which
      grows a man; from this tiny substance results a single principle, to which
      some force, some movement must be given. Since there is no overruling
      creator, this principle must give to itself the outward forms which
      constitute our world&mdash;for this phenomenon of life is the same
      everywhere. Yes, for metals as for human beings, for plants as for men,
      life begins in an imperceptible embryo which develops itself. A primitive
      principle exists; let us seize it at the point where it begins to act upon
      itself, where it is a unit, where it is a principle before taking definite
      form, a cause before being an effect; we must see it single, without form,
      susceptible of clothing itself with all the outward forms we shall see it
      take. When we are face to face with this atomic particle, when we shall
      have caught its movement at the very instant of motion, <i>then</i> we
      shall know the law; thenceforth we are the masters of life, masters who
      can impose upon that principle the form we choose,&mdash;with gold to win
      the world, and the power to make for ourselves centuries of life in which
      to enjoy it! That is what my people and I are seeking. All our strength,
      all our thoughts are strained in that direction; nothing distracts us from
      it. One hour wasted on any other passion is a theft committed against our
      true grandeur. Just as you have never found your hounds relinquishing the
      hunted animal or failing to be in at the death, so I have never seen one
      of my patient disciples diverted from this great quest by the love of
      woman or a selfish thought. If an adept seeks power and wealth, the desire
      is instigated by our needs; he grasps treasure as a thirsty dog laps water
      while he swims a stream, because his crucibles are in need of a diamond to
      melt or an ingot of gold to reduce to powder. To each his own work. One
      seeks the secret of vegetable nature; he watches the slow life of plants;
      he notes the parity of motion among all the species, and the parity of
      their nutrition; he finds everywhere the need of sun and air and water, to
      fecundate and nourish them. Another scrutinizes the blood of animals. A
      third studies the laws of universal motion and its connection with
      celestial revolutions. Nearly all are eager to struggle with the
      intractable nature of metal, for while we find many principles in other
      things, we find all metals like unto themselves in every particular. Hence
      a common error as to our work. Behold these patient, indefatigable
      athletes, ever vanquished, yet ever returning to the combat! Humanity,
      sire, is behind us, as the huntsman is behind your hounds. She cries to
      us: &lsquo;Make haste! neglect nothing! sacrifice all, even a man, ye who
      sacrifice yourselves! Hasten! hasten! Beat down the arms of DEATH, mine
      enemy!&rsquo; Yes, sire, we are inspired by a hope which involves the happiness
      of all coming generations. We have buried many men&mdash;and what men!&mdash;dying
      of this Search. Setting foot in this career we cannot work for ourselves;
      we may die without discovering the Secret; and our death is that of those
      who do not believe in another life; it is this life that we have sought,
      and failed to perpetuate. We are glorious martyrs; we have the welfare of
      the race at heart; we have failed but we live again in our successors. As
      we go through this existence we discover secrets with which we endow the
      liberal and the mechanical arts. From our furnaces gleam lights which
      illumine industrial enterprises, and perfect them. Gunpowder issued from
      our alembics; nay, we have mastered the lightning. In our persistent
      vigils lie political revolutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; cried the king, springing once more from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the grand-master of the new Templars. &ldquo;<i>Tradidit mundum
      disputationibus</i>! God has given us the earth. Hear this once more: man
      is master here below; matter is his; all forces, all means are at his
      disposal. Who created us? Motion. What power maintains life in us? Motion.
      Why cannot science seize the secret of that motion? Nothing is lost here
      below; nothing escapes from our planet to go elsewhere,&mdash;otherwise
      the stars would stumble over each other; the waters of the deluge are
      still with us in their principle, and not a drop is lost. Around us, above
      us, beneath us, are to be found the elements from which have come
      innumerable hosts of men who have crowded the earth before and since the
      deluge. What is the secret of our struggle? To discover the force that
      disunites, and then, <i>then</i> we shall discover that which binds. We
      are the product of a visible manufacture. When the waters covered the
      globe men issued from them who found the elements of their life in the
      crust of the earth, in the air, and in the nourishment derived from them.
      Earth and air possess, therefore, the principle of human transformations;
      those transformations take place under our eyes, by means of that which is
      also under our eyes. We are able, therefore, to discover that secret,&mdash;not
      limiting the effort of the search to one man or to one age, but devoting
      humanity in its duration to it. We are engaged, hand to hand, in a
      struggle with Matter, into whose secret, I, the grand-master of our order,
      seek to penetrate. Christophe Columbus gave a world to the King of Spain;
      I seek an ever-living people for the King of France. Standing on the
      confines which separate us from a knowledge of material things, a patient
      observer of atoms, I destroy forms, I dissolve the bonds of combinations;
      I imitate death that I may learn how to imitate life. I strike incessantly
      at the door of creation, and I shall continue so to strike until the day
      of my death. When I am dead the knocker will pass into other hands equally
      persistent with those of the mighty men who handed it to me. Fabulous and
      uncomprehended beings, like Prometheus, Ixion, Adonis, Pan, and others,
      who have entered into the religious beliefs of all countries and all ages,
      prove to the world that the hopes we now embody were born with the human
      races. Chaldea, India, Persia, Egypt, Greece, the Moors, have transmitted
      from one to another Magic, the highest of all the occult sciences, which
      holds within it, as a precious deposit the fruits of the studies of each
      generation. In it lay the tie that bound the grand and majestic
      institution of the Templars. Sire, when one of your predecessors burned
      the Templars, he burned men only,&mdash;their Secret lived. The
      reconstruction of the Temple is a vow of an unknown nation, a race of
      daring seekers, whose faces are turned to the Orient of <i>life</i>,&mdash;all
      brothers, all inseparable, all united by one idea, and stamped with the
      mark of toil. I am the sovereign leader of that people, sovereign by
      election, not by birth. I guide them onward to a knowledge of the essence
      of life. Grand-master, Red-Cross-bearers, companions, adepts, we forever
      follow the imperceptible molecule which still escapes our eyes. But soon
      we shall make ourselves eyes more powerful than those which Nature has
      given us; we shall attain to a sight of the primitive atom, the
      corpuscular element so persistently sought by the wise and learned of all
      ages who have preceded us in the glorious search. Sire, when a man is
      astride of that abyss, when he commands bold divers like my disciples, all
      other human interests are as nothing. Therefore we are not dangerous.
      Religious disputes and political struggles are far away from us; we have
      passed beyond and above them. No man takes others by the throat when his
      whole strength is given to a struggle with Nature. Besides, in our science
      results are perceivable; we can measure effects and predict them; whereas
      all things are uncertain and vacillating in the struggles of men and their
      selfish interests. We decompose the diamond in our crucibles, and we shall
      make diamonds, we shall make gold! We shall impel vessels (as they have at
      Barcelona) with fire and a little water! We test the wind, and we shall
      make wind; we shall make light; we shall renew the face of empires with
      new industries! But we shall never debase ourselves to mount a throne to
      be crucified by the peoples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his strong determination not to be taken in by Italian wiles,
      the king, together with his gentle mistress, was already caught and snared
      by the ambiguous phrases and doublings of this pompous and humbugging
      loquacity. The eyes of the two lovers showed how their minds were dazzled
      by the mysterious riches of power thus displayed; they saw, as it were, a
      series of subterranean caverns filled with gnomes at their toil. The
      impatience of their curiosity put to flight all suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;if this be so, you are great statesmen who can
      enlighten us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire,&rdquo; said Lorenzo, naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is not given to any man to foresee what will happen when
      thousands of men are gathered together. We can tell what one man will do,
      how long he will live, whether he will be happy or unhappy; but we cannot
      tell what a collection of wills may do; and to calculate the oscillations
      of their selfish interests is more difficult still, for interests are men
      <i>plus</i> things. We can, in solitude, see the future as a whole, and
      that is all. The Protestantism that now torments you will be destroyed in
      turn by its material consequences, which will turn to theories in due
      time. Europe is at the present moment getting the better of religion;
      to-morrow it will attack royalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Saint-Bartholomew was a great conception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire; for if the people triumph it will have a Saint-Bartholomew of
      its own. When religion and royalty are destroyed the people will attack
      the nobles; after the nobles, the rich. When Europe has become a mere
      troop of men without consistence or stability, because without leaders, it
      will fall a prey to brutal conquerors. Twenty times already has the world
      seen that sight, and Europe is now preparing to renew it. Ideas consume
      the ages as passions consume men. When man is cured, humanity may possibly
      cure itself. Science is the essence of humanity, and we are its pontiffs;
      whoso concerns himself about the essence cares little about the individual
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what have you attained, so far?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We advance slowly; but we lose nothing that we have won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are the king of sorcerers?&rdquo; retorted the king, piqued at being
      of no account in the presence of this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majestic grand-master of the Rosicrucians cast a look on Charles IX.
      which withered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the king of men,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am the king of ideas. If we were
      sorcerers, you would already have burned us. We have had our martyrs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by what means are you able to cast nativities?&rdquo; persisted the king.
      &ldquo;How did you know that the man who came to your window last night was King
      of France? What power authorized one of you to tell my mother the fate of
      her three sons? Can you, grand-master of an art which claims to mould the
      world, can you tell me what my mother is planning at this moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer was given before Cosmo could pull his brother&rsquo;s robe to enjoin
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why my brother, the King of Poland, has returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our most cruel enemies are our nearest in blood!&rdquo; exclaimed the king,
      violently, rising and walking about the room with hasty steps. &ldquo;Kings have
      neither brothers, nor sons, nor mothers. Coligny was right; my murderers
      are not among the Huguenots, but in the Louvre. You are either imposters
      or regicides!&mdash;Jacob, call Solern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Marie Touchet, &ldquo;the Ruggieri have your word as a gentleman.
      You wanted to taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge; do not complain
      of its bitterness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled, with an expression of bitter self-contempt; he thought
      his material royalty petty in presence of the august intellectual royalty
      of Lorenzo Ruggiero. Charles IX. knew that he could scarcely govern
      France, but this grand-master of Rosicrucians ruled a submissive and
      intelligent world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me truthfully; I pledge my word as a gentleman that your answer,
      in case it confesses dreadful crimes, shall be as if it were never
      uttered,&rdquo; resumed the king. &ldquo;Do you deal with poisons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To discover that which gives life, we must also have full knowledge of
      that which kills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you possess the secret of many poisons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&mdash;in theory, but not in practice. We understand all
      poisons, but do not use them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my mother asked you for any?&rdquo; said the king, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, &ldquo;Queen Catherine is too able a woman to employ
      such means. She knows that the sovereign who poisons dies by poison. The
      Borgias, also Bianca Capello, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, are noted examples
      of the dangers of that miserable resource. All things are known at courts;
      there can be no concealment. It may be possible to kill a poor devil&mdash;and
      what is the good of that?&mdash;but to aim at great men cannot be done
      secretly. Who shot Coligny? It could only be you, or the queen-mother, or
      the Guises. Not a soul is doubtful of that. Believe me, poison cannot be
      twice used with impunity in statecraft. Princes have successors. As for
      other men, if, like Luther, they are sovereigns through the power of
      ideas, their doctrines are not killed by killing them. The queen is from
      Florence; she knows that poison should never be used except as a weapon of
      personal revenge. My brother, who has not been parted from her since her
      arrival in France, knows the grief that Madame Diane caused your mother.
      But she never thought of poisoning her, though she might easily have done
      so. What could your father have said? Never had a woman a better right to
      do it; and she could have done it with impunity; but Madame de Valentinois
      still lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of those waxen images?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Cosmo, &ldquo;these things are so absolutely harmless that we lend
      ourselves to the practice to satisfy blind passions, just as physicians
      give bread pills to imaginary invalids. A disappointed woman fancies that
      by stabbing the heart of a wax-figure she has brought misfortunes upon the
      head of the man who has been unfaithful to her. What harm in that?
      Besides, it is our revenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pope sells indulgences,&rdquo; said Lorenzo Ruggiero, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my mother practised these spells with waxen images?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would such harmless means be to one who has the actual power to
      do all things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Queen Catherine the power to save you at this moment?&rdquo; inquired the
      king, in a threatening manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, we are not in any danger,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, tranquilly. &ldquo;I knew
      before I came into this house that I should leave it safely, just as I
      know that the king will be evilly disposed to my brother Cosmo a few weeks
      hence. My brother may run some danger then, but he will escape it. If the
      king reigns by the sword, he also reigns by justice,&rdquo; added the old man,
      alluding to the famous motto on a medal struck for Charles IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all, and you know that I shall die soon, which is very well,&rdquo;
       said the king, hiding his anger under nervous impatience; &ldquo;but how will my
      brother die,&mdash;he whom you say is to be Henri III.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a violent death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Duc d&rsquo;Alencon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not reign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Henri de Bourbon will be king of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a violent death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am dead what will become of madame?&rdquo; asked the king, motioning to
      Marie Touchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Belleville will marry, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are imposters!&rdquo; cried Marie Touchet. &ldquo;Send them away, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, the Ruggieri have my word as a gentleman,&rdquo; replied the king,
      smiling. &ldquo;Will madame have children?&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire; and madame will live to be more than eighty years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I order them to be hanged?&rdquo; said the king to his mistress. &ldquo;But
      about my son, the Comte d&rsquo;Auvergne?&rdquo; he continued, going into the next
      room to fetch the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you tell him I should marry?&rdquo; said Marie to the two brothers, the
      moment they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, with dignity, &ldquo;the king bound us to tell the
      truth, and we have told it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Is</i> that true?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as it is that the governor of the city of Orleans is madly in
      love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not love him,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, madame,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo; &ldquo;but your horoscope declares that
      you will marry the man who is in love with you at the present time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not lie a little for my sake?&rdquo; she said smiling; &ldquo;for if the king
      believes your predictions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not also necessary that he should believe our innocence?&rdquo;
       interrupted Cosmo, with a wily glance at the young favorite. &ldquo;The
      precautions taken against us by the king have made us think during the
      time we have spent in your charming jail that the occult sciences have
      been traduced to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not feel uneasy,&rdquo; replied Marie. &ldquo;I know him; his suspicions are at an
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are innocent,&rdquo; said the grand-master of the Rosicrucians, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for you,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;for your laboratory, and your
      retorts and phials are now being searched by order of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers looked at each other smiling. Marie Touchet took that smile
      for one of innocence, though it really signified: &ldquo;Poor fools! can they
      suppose that if we brew poisons, we do not hide them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the king&rsquo;s searchers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Rene&rsquo;s laboratory,&rdquo; replied Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the brothers glanced at each other with a look which said: &ldquo;The
      hotel de Soissons is inviolable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king had so completely forgotten his suspicions that when, as he took
      his boy in his arms, Jacob gave him a note from Chapelain, he opened it
      with the certainty of finding in his physician&rsquo;s report that nothing had
      been discovered in the laboratory but what related exclusively to alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he live a happy man?&rdquo; asked the king, presenting his son to the two
      alchemists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question which concerns Cosmo,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo, signing his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cosmo took the tiny hand of the child, and examined it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Charles IX. to the old man, &ldquo;if you find it necessary to
      deny the existence of the soul in order to believe in the possibility of
      your enterprise, will you explain to my why you should doubt what your
      power does? Thought, which you seek to nullify, is the certainty, the
      torch which lights your researches. Ha! ha! is not that the motion of a
      spirit within you, while you deny such motion?&rdquo; cried the king, pleased
      with his argument, and looking triumphantly at his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought,&rdquo; replied Lorenzo Ruggiero, &ldquo;is the exercise of an inward sense;
      just as the faculty of seeing several objects and noticing their size and
      color is an effect of sight. It has no connection with what people choose
      to call another life. Thought is a faculty which ceases, with the forces
      which produced it, when we cease to breathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are logical,&rdquo; said the king, surprised. &ldquo;But alchemy must therefore
      be an atheistical science.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A materialist science, sire, which is a very different thing. Materialism
      is the outcome of Indian doctrines, transmitted through the mysteries of
      Isis to Chaldea and Egypt, and brought to Greece by Pythagoras, one of the
      demigods of humanity. His doctrine of re-incarnation is the mathematics of
      materialism, the vital law of its phases. To each of the different
      creations which form the terrestrial creation belongs the power of
      retarding the movement which sweeps on the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alchemy is the science of sciences!&rdquo; cried Charles IX., enthusiastically.
      &ldquo;I want to see you at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever it pleases you, sire; you cannot be more interested than Madame
      the Queen-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so this is why she cares for you?&rdquo; exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house of Medici has secretly protected our Search for more than a
      century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Cosmo, &ldquo;this child will live nearly a hundred years; he will
      have trials; nevertheless, he will be happy and honored, because he has in
      his veins the blood of the Valois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and see you in your laboratory, messieurs,&rdquo; said the king, his
      good-humor quite restored. &ldquo;You may now go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers bowed to Marie and to the king and then withdrew. They went
      down the steps of the portico gravely, without looking or speaking to each
      other; neither did they turn their faces to the windows as they crossed
      the courtyard, feeling sure that the king&rsquo;s eye watched them. But as they
      passed sideways out of the gate into the street they looked back and saw
      Charles IX. gazing after them from a window. When the alchemist and the
      astrologer were safely in the rue de l&rsquo;Autruche, they cast their eyes
      before and behind them, to see if they were followed or overheard; then
      they continued their way to the moat of the Louvre without uttering a
      word. Once there, however, feeling themselves securely alone, Lorenzo said
      to Cosmo, in the Tuscan Italian of that day:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affe d&rsquo;Iddio! how we have fooled him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much good may it do him; let him make what he can of it!&rdquo; said Cosmo. &ldquo;We
      have given him a helping hand,&mdash;whether the queen pays it back to us
      or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some days after this scene, which struck the king&rsquo;s mistress as forcibly
      as it did the king, Marie suddenly exclaimed, in one of those moments when
      the soul seems, as it were, disengaged from the body in the plenitude of
      happiness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, I understand Lorenzo Ruggiero; but did you observe that Cosmo
      said nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the king, struck by that sudden light. &ldquo;After all, there was
      as much falsehood as truth in what they said. Those Italians are as supple
      as the silk they weave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suspicion explains the rancor which the king showed against Cosmo
      when the trial of La Mole and Coconnas took place a few weeks later.
      Finding him one of the agents of that conspiracy, he thought the Italians
      had tricked him; for it was proved that his mother&rsquo;s astrologer was not
      exclusively concerned with stars, the powder of projection, and the
      primitive atom. Lorenzo had by that time left the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the incredulity which most persons show in these matters, the
      events which followed the scene we have narrated confirmed the predictions
      of the Ruggieri.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king died within three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles de Gondi followed Charles IX. to the grave, as had been foretold
      to him jestingly by his brother the Marechal de Retz, a friend of the
      Ruggieri, who believed in their predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie Touchet married Charles de Balzac, Marquis d&rsquo;Entragues, the governor
      of Orleans, by whom she had two daughters. The most celebrated of these
      daughters, the half-sister of the Comte d&rsquo;Auvergne, was the mistress of
      Henri IV., and it was she who endeavored, at the time of Biron&rsquo;s
      conspiracy, to put her brother on the throne of France by driving out the
      Bourbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comte d&rsquo;Auvergne, who became the Duc d&rsquo;Angouleme, lived into the reign
      of Louis XIV. He coined money on his estates and altered the inscriptions;
      but Louis XIV. let him do as he pleased, out of respect for the blood of
      the Valois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cosmo Ruggiero lived till the middle of the reign of Louis XIII.; he
      witnessed the fall of the house of the Medici in France, also that of the
      Concini. History has taken pains to record that he died an atheist, that
      is, a materialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquise d&rsquo;Entragues was over eighty when she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous Comte de Saint-Germain, who made so much noise under Louis
      XIV., was a pupil of Lorenzo and Cosmo Ruggiero. This celebrated alchemist
      lived to be one hundred and thirty years old,&mdash;an age which some
      biographers give to Marion de Lorme. He must have heard from the Ruggieri
      the various incidents of the Saint-Bartholomew and of the reigns of the
      Valois kings, which he afterwards recounted in the first person singular,
      as though he had played a part in them. The Comte de Saint-Germain was the
      last of the alchemists who knew how to clearly explain their science; but
      he left no writings. The cabalistic doctrine presented in this Study is
      that taught by this mysterious personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, behold a strange thing! Three lives, that of the old man from
      whom I have obtained these facts, that of the Comte de Saint-Germain, and
      that of Cosmo Ruggiero, suffice to cover the whole of European history
      from Francois I. to Napoleon! Only fifty such lives are needed to reach
      back to the first known period of the world. &ldquo;What are fifty generations
      for the study of the mysteries of life?&rdquo; said the Comte de Saint-Germain.

      I. TWO DREAMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1786 Bodard de Saint-James, treasurer of the navy, excited more
      attention and gossip as to his luxury than any other financier in Paris.
      At this period he was building his famous &ldquo;Folie&rdquo; at Neuilly, and his wife
      had just bought a set of feathers to crown the tester of her bed, the
      price of which had been too great for even the queen to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bodard owned the magnificent mansion in the place Vendome, which the <i>fermier-general</i>,
      Dange, had lately been forced to leave. That celebrated epicurean was now
      dead, and on the day of his interment his intimate friend, Monsieur de
      Bievre, raised a laugh by saying that he &ldquo;could now pass through the place
      Vendome without <i>danger</i>.&rdquo; This allusion to the hellish gambling
      which went on in the dead man&rsquo;s house, was his only funeral oration. The
      house is opposite to the Chancellerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      To end in a few words the history of Bodard,&mdash;he became a poor man,
      having failed for fourteen millions after the bankruptcy of the Prince de
      Guemenee. The stupidity he showed in not anticipating that &ldquo;serenissime
      disaster,&rdquo; to use the expression of Lebrun Pindare, was the reason why no
      notice was taken of his misfortunes. He died, like Bourvalais, Bouret, and
      so many others, in a garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Bodard de Saint-James was ambitious, and professed to receive none
      but persons of quality at her house,&mdash;an old absurdity which is ever
      new. To her thinking, even the parliamentary judges were of small account;
      she wished for titled persons in her salons, or at all events, those who
      had the right of entrance at court. To say that many <i>cordons bleus</i>
      were seen at her house would be false; but it is quite certain that she
      managed to obtain the good-will and civilities of several members of the
      house of Rohan, as was proved later in the affair of the too celebrated
      diamond necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;it was, I think, in August, 1786&mdash;I was much
      surprised to meet in the salons of this lady, so exacting in the matter of
      gentility, two new faces which struck me as belonging to men of inferior
      social position. She came to me presently in the embrasure of a window
      where I had ensconced myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said to her, with a glance toward one of the new-comers, &ldquo;who
      and what is that queer species? Why do you have that kind of thing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see him through a prism of love, or am I blind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not blind,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;The man is as ugly as a
      caterpillar; but he has done me the most immense service a woman can
      receive from a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I looked at her rather maliciously she hastened to add: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      physician, and he has completely cured me of those odious red blotches
      which spoiled my complexion and made me look like a peasant woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a charlatan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is the surgeon of the court pages. He has a fine
      intellect, I assure you; in fact, he is a writer, and a very learned man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! if his style resembles his face!&rdquo; I said scoffingly. &ldquo;But who is
      the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That spruce, affected little popinjay over there, who looks as if he had
      been drinking verjuice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a rather well-born man,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;just arrived from some
      province, I forget which&mdash;oh! from Artois. He is sent here to
      conclude an affair in which the Cardinal de Rohan is interested, and his
      Eminence in person had just presented him to Monsieur de Saint-James. It
      seems they have both chosen my husband as arbitrator. The provincial
      didn&rsquo;t show his wisdom in that; but fancy what simpletons the people who
      sent him here must be to trust a case to a man of his sort! He is as meek
      as a sheep and as timid as a girl. His Eminence is very kind to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the nature of the affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a question of three hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the man is a lawyer?&rdquo; I said, with a slight shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat confused by this humiliating avowal, Madame Bodard returned to
      her place at a faro-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the tables were full. I had nothing to do, no one to speak to, and I
      had just lost two thousand crowns to Monsieur de Laval. I flung myself on
      a sofa near the fireplace. Presently, if there was ever a man on earth
      most utterly astonished it was I, when, on looking up, I saw, seated on
      another sofa on the opposite side of the fireplace, Monsieur de Calonne,
      the comptroller-general. He seemed to be dozing, or else he was buried in
      one of those deep meditations which overtake statesmen. When I pointed out
      the famous minister to Beaumarchais, who happened to come near me at that
      moment, the father of Figaro explained the mystery of his presence in that
      house without uttering a word. He pointed first at my head, then at
      Bodard&rsquo;s with a malicious gesture which consisted in turning to each of us
      two fingers of his hand while he kept the others doubled up. My first
      impulse was to rise and say something rousing to Calonne; then I paused,
      first, because I thought of a trick I could play the statesman, and
      secondly, because Beaumarchais caught me familiarly by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you do that, monsieur?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He winked at the comptroller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wake him,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;A man is happy when asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, is sleep a financial scheme?&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; said Calonne, who had guessed our words from the mere
      motion of our lips. &ldquo;Would to God we could sleep long, and then the
      awakening you are about to see would never happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the dramatist, &ldquo;I must thank you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Mirabeau has started for Berlin. I don&rsquo;t know whether we
      might not both have drowned ourselves in that affair of &lsquo;les Eaux.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have too much memory, and too little gratitude,&rdquo; replied the
      minister, annoyed at having one of his secrets divulged in my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Beaumarchais, cut to the quick; &ldquo;but I have millions that
      can balance many a score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calonne pretended not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long past midnight when the play ceased. Supper was announced.
      There were ten of us at table: Bodard and his wife, Calonne, Beaumarchais,
      the two strange men, two pretty women, whose names I will not give here, a
      <i>fermier-general</i>, Lavoisier, and myself. Out of thirty guests who
      were in the salon when I entered it, only these ten remained. The two <i>queer
      species</i> did not consent to stay until they were urged to do so by
      Madame Bodard, who probably thought she was paying her obligations to the
      surgeon by giving him something to eat, and pleasing her husband (with
      whom she appeared, I don&rsquo;t precisely know why, to be coquetting) by
      inviting the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper began by being frightfully dull. The two strangers and the <i>fermier-general</i>
      oppressed us. I made a sign to Beaumarchais to intoxicate the son of
      Esculapius, who sat on his right, giving him to understand that I would do
      the same by the lawyer, who was next to me. As there seemed no other way
      to amuse ourselves, and it offered a chance to draw out the two men, who
      were already sufficiently singular, Monsieur de Calonne smiled at our
      project. The ladies present also shared in the bacchanal conspiracy, and
      the wine of Sillery crowned our glasses again and again with its silvery
      foam. The surgeon was easily managed; but at the second glass which I
      offered to my neighbor the lawyer, he told me with the frigid politeness
      of a usurer that he should drink no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Madame de Saint-James chanced to introduce, I scarcely
      know how, the topic of the marvellous suppers to the Comte de Cagliostro,
      given by the Cardinal de Rohan. My mind was not very attentive to what the
      mistress of the house was saying, because I was watching with extreme
      curiosity the pinched and livid face of my little neighbor, whose
      principal feature was a turned-up and at the same time pointed nose, which
      made him, at times, look very like a weasel. Suddenly his cheeks flushed
      as he caught the words of a dispute between Madame de Saint-James and
      Monsieur de Calonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you, monsieur,&rdquo; she was saying, with an imperious air, &ldquo;that
      I <i>saw</i> Cleopatra, the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it, madame,&rdquo; said my neighbor, &ldquo;for I myself have spoken to
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Monsieur de Calonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words uttered by the little provincial were said in a voice of strange
      sonorousness, if I may be permitted to borrow that expression from the
      science of physics. This sudden clearness of intonation, coming from a man
      who had hitherto scarcely spoken, and then in a low and modulated tone,
      surprised all present exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he is talking!&rdquo; said the surgeon, who was now in a satisfactory
      state of drunkenness, addressing Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His neighbor must have pulled his wires,&rdquo; replied the satirist.
    </p>
    <p>
      My man flushed again as he overheard the words, though they were said in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, how was the late queen?&rdquo; asked Calonne, jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not swear that the person with whom I supped last night at the
      house of the Cardinal de Rohan was Catherine de&rsquo; Medici in person. That
      miracle would justly seem impossible to Christians as well as to
      philosophers,&rdquo; said the little lawyer, resting the tips of his fingers on
      the table, and leaning back in his chair as if preparing to make a speech.
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I do assert that the woman I saw resembled Catherine de&rsquo; 
      Medici as closely as though they were twin-sisters. She was dressed in a
      black velvet gown, precisely like that of the queen in the well-known
      portrait which belongs to the king; on her head was the pointed velvet
      coif, which is characteristic of her; and she had the wan complexion, and
      the features we all know well. I could not help betraying my surprise to
      his Eminence. The suddenness of the evocation seemed to me all the more
      amazing because Monsieur de Cagliostro had been unable to divine the name
      of the person with whom I wished to communicate. I was confounded. The
      magical spectacle of a supper, where one of the illustrious women of past
      times presented herself, took from me my presence of mind. I listened
      without daring to question. When I roused myself about midnight from the
      spell of that magic, I was inclined to doubt my senses. But even this
      great marvel seemed natural in comparison with the singular hallucination
      to which I was presently subjected. I don&rsquo;t know in what words I can
      describe to you the state of my senses. But I declare, in the sincerity of
      my heart, I no longer wonder that souls have been found weak enough, or
      strong enough, to believe in the mysteries of magic and in the power of
      demons. For myself, until I am better informed, I regard as possible the
      apparitions which Cardan and other thaumaturgists describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, said with indescribable eloquence of tone, were of a nature
      to rouse the curiosity of all present. We looked at the speaker and kept
      silence; our eyes alone betrayed our interest, their pupils reflecting the
      light of the wax-candles in the sconces. By dint of observing this unknown
      little man, I fancied I could see the pores of his skin, especially those
      of his forehead, emitting an inward sentiment with which he was saturated.
      This man, apparently so cold and formal, seemed to contain within him a
      burning altar, the flames of which beat down upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if the Figure evoked followed me
      invisibly, but no sooner had my head touched the pillow in my own chamber
      than I saw once more that grand Shade of Catherine rise before me. I felt
      myself, instinctively, in a luminous sphere, and my eyes, fastened upon
      the queen with intolerable fixity, saw naught but her. Suddenly, she bent
      toward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the ladies present made a unanimous movement of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the lawyer, &ldquo;I am not sure that I ought to relate what
      happened, for though I am inclined to believe it was all a dream, it
      concerns grave matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of religion?&rdquo; asked Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any impropriety,&rdquo; remarked Calonne, &ldquo;these ladies will excuse
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It relates to the government,&rdquo; replied the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;Voltaire, Diderot, and their fellows
      have already begun to tutor us on that subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calonne became very attentive, and his neighbor, Madame de Genlis, rather
      anxious. The little provincial still hesitated, and Beaumarchais said to
      him somewhat roughly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, <i>maitre</i>, go on! Don&rsquo;t you know that when the laws allow but
      little liberty the people seek their freedom in their morals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, the small man told his tale:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether it was that certain ideas were fermenting in my brain, or that
      some strange power impelled me, I said to her: &lsquo;Ah! madame, you committed
      a very great crime.&rsquo; &lsquo;What crime?&rsquo; she asked in a grave voice. &lsquo;The crime
      for which the signal was given from the clock of the palace on the 24th of
      August,&rsquo; I answered. She smiled disdainfully, and a few deep wrinkles
      appeared on her pallid cheeks. &lsquo;You call that a crime which was only a
      misfortune,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;The enterprise, being ill-managed, failed; the
      benefit we expected for France, for Europe, for the Catholic Church was
      lost. Impossible to foresee that. Our orders were ill executed; we did not
      find as many Montlucs as we needed. Posterity will not hold us responsible
      for the failure of communications, which deprived our work of the unity of
      movement which is essential to all great strokes of policy; that was our
      misfortune! If on the 25th of August not the shadow of a Huguenot had been
      left in France, I should go down to the uttermost posterity as a noble
      image of Providence. How many, many times have the clear-sighted souls of
      Sixtus the Fifth, Richelieu, Bossuet, reproached me secretly for having
      failed in that enterprise after having the boldness to conceive it! How
      many and deep regrets for that failure attended my deathbed! Thirty years
      after the Saint-Bartholomew the evil it might have cured was still in
      existence. That failure caused ten times more blood to flow in France than
      if the massacre of August 24th had been completed on the 26th. The
      revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in honor of which you have struck
      medals, has cost more tears, more blood, more money, and killed the
      prosperity of France far more than three Saint-Bartholomews. Letellier
      with his pen gave effect to a decree which the throne had secretly
      promulgated since my time; but, though the vast execution was necessary of
      the 25th of August, 1572, on the 25th of August, 1685, it was useless.
      Under the second son of Henri de Valois heresy had scarcely conceived an
      offspring; under the second son of Henri de Bourbon that teeming mother
      had cast her spawn over the whole universe. You accuse me of a crime, and
      you put up statues to the son of Anne of Austria! Nevertheless, he and I
      attempted the same thing; he succeeded, I failed; but Louis XIV. found the
      Protestants without arms, whereas in my reign they had powerful armies,
      statesmen, warriors, and all Germany on their side.&rsquo; At these words,
      slowly uttered, I felt an inward shudder pass through me. I fancied I
      breathed the fumes of blood from I know not what great mass of victims.
      Catherine was magnified. She stood before me like an evil genius; she
      sought, it seemed to me, to enter my consciousness and abide there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dreamed all that,&rdquo; whispered Beaumarchais; &ldquo;he certainly never
      invented it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My reason is bewildered,&rsquo; I said to the queen. &lsquo;You praise yourself for
      an act which three generations of men have condemned, stigmatized, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Add,&rsquo; she rejoined, &lsquo;that historians have been more unjust toward me than
      my contemporaries. None have defended me. I, rich and all-powerful, am
      accused of ambition! I am taxed with cruelty,&mdash;I who have but two
      deaths upon my conscience. Even to impartial minds I am still a problem.
      Do you believe that I was actuated by hatred, that vengeance and fury were
      the breath of my nostrils?&rsquo; She smiled with pity. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I
      was cold and calm as reason itself. I condemned the Huguenots without
      pity, but without passion; they were the rotten fruit in my basket and I
      cast them out. Had I been Queen of England, I should have treated
      seditious Catholics in the same way. The life of our power in those days
      depended on their being but one God, one Faith, one Master in the State.
      Happily for me, I uttered my justification in one sentence which history
      is transmitting. When Birago falsely announced to me the loss of the
      battle of Dreux, I answered: &ldquo;Well then; we will go to the Protestant
      churches.&rdquo; Did I hate the reformers? No, I esteemed them much, and I knew
      them little. If I felt any aversion to the politicians of my time, it was
      to that base Cardinal de Lorraine, and to his brother the shrewd and
      brutal soldier who spied upon my every act. They were the real enemies of
      my children; they sought to snatch the crown; I saw them daily at work and
      they wore me out. If <i>we</i> had not ordered the Saint-Bartholomew, the
      Guises would have done the same thing by the help of Rome and the monks.
      The League, which was powerful only in consequence of my old age, would
      have begun in 1573.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, madame, instead of ordering that horrible
      murder (pardon my plainness) why not have employed the vast resources of
      your political power in giving to the Reformers those wise institutions
      which made the reign of Henri IV. so glorious and so peaceful?&rsquo; She smiled
      again and shrugged her shoulders, the hollow wrinkles of her pallid face
      giving her an expression of the bitterest sarcasm. &lsquo;The peoples,&rsquo; she
      said, &lsquo;need periods of rest after savage feuds; there lies the secret of
      that reign. But Henri IV. committed two irreparable blunders. He ought
      neither to have abjured Protestantism, nor, after becoming a Catholic
      himself, should he have left France Catholic. He, alone, was in a position
      to have changed the whole of France without a jar. Either not a stole, or
      not a conventicle&mdash;that should have been his motto. To leave two
      bitter enemies, two antagonistic principles in a government with nothing
      to balance them, that is the crime of kings; it is thus that they sow
      revolutions. To God alone belongs the right to keep good and evil
      perpetually together in his work. But it may be,&rsquo; she said reflectively,
      &lsquo;that that sentence was inscribed on the foundation of Henri IV.&lsquo;s policy,
      and it may have caused his death. It is impossible that Sully did not cast
      covetous eyes on the vast wealth of the clergy,&mdash;which the clergy did
      not possess in peace, for the nobles robbed them of at least two-thirds of
      their revenue. Sully, the Reformer, himself owned abbeys.&rsquo; She paused, and
      appeared to reflect. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; she resumed, &lsquo;remember you are asking the
      niece of a Pope to justify her Catholicism.&rsquo; She stopped again. &lsquo;And yet,
      after all,&rsquo; she added with a gesture of some levity, &lsquo;I should have made a
      good Calvinist! Do the wise men of your century still think that religion
      had anything to do with that struggle, the greatest which Europe has ever
      seen?&mdash;a vast revolution, retarded by little causes which, however,
      will not be prevented from overwhelming the world because I failed to
      smother it; a revolution,&rsquo; she said, giving me a solemn look, &lsquo;which is
      still advancing, and which you might consummate. Yes, <i>you</i>, who hear
      me!&rsquo; I shuddered. &lsquo;What! has no one yet understood that the old interests
      and the new interests seized Rome and Luther as mere banners? What! do
      they not know Louis IX., to escape just such a struggle, dragged a
      population a hundredfold more in number than I destroyed from their homes
      and left their bones on the sands of Egypt, for which he was made a saint?
      while I&mdash;But I,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;<i>failed</i>.&rsquo; She bowed her head and
      was silent for some moments. I no longer beheld a queen, but rather one of
      those ancient druidesses to whom human lives are sacrificed; who unroll
      the pages of the future and exhume the teachings of the past. But soon she
      uplifted her regal and majestic form. &lsquo;Luther and Calvin,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;by
      calling the attention of the burghers to the abuses of the Roman Church,
      gave birth in Europe to a spirit of investigation which was certain to
      lead the peoples to examine all things. Examination leads to doubt.
      Instead of faith, which is necessary to all societies, those two men drew
      after them, in the far distance, a strange philosophy, armed with hammers,
      hungry for destruction. Science sprang, sparkling with her specious
      lights, from the bosom of heresy. It was far less a question of reforming
      a Church than of winning indefinite liberty for man&mdash;which is the
      death of power. I saw that. The consequence of the successes won by the
      religionists in their struggle against the priesthood (already better
      armed and more formidable than the Crown) was the destruction of the
      monarchical power raised by Louis IX. at such vast cost upon the ruins of
      feudality. It involved, in fact, nothing less than the annihilation of
      religion and royalty, on the ruins of which the whole burgher class of
      Europe meant to stand. The struggle was therefore war without quarter
      between the new ideas and the law,&mdash;that is, the old beliefs. The
      Catholics were the emblem of the material interests of royalty, of the
      great lords, and of the clergy. It was a duel to the death between two
      giants; unfortunately, the Saint-Bartholomew proved to be only a wound.
      Remember this: because a few drops of blood were spared at that opportune
      moment, torrents were compelled to flow at a later period. The intellect
      which soars above a nation cannot escape a great misfortune; I mean the
      misfortune of finding no equals capable of judging it when it succumbs
      beneath the weight of untoward events. My equals are few; fools are in the
      majority: that statement explains it all. If my name is execrated in
      France, the fault lies with the commonplace minds who form the mass of all
      generations. In the great crises through which I passed, the duty of
      reigning was not the mere giving of audiences, reviewing of troops,
      signing of decrees. I may have committed mistakes, for I was but a woman.
      But why was there then no man who rose above his age? The Duke of Alba had
      a soul of iron; Philip II. was stupefied by Catholic belief; Henri IV. was
      a gambling soldier and a libertine; the Admiral, a stubborn mule. Louis
      XI. lived too soon, Richelieu too late. Virtuous or criminal, guilty or
      not in the Saint-Bartholomew, I accept the onus of it; I stand between
      those two great men,&mdash;the visible link of an unseen chain. The day
      will come when some paradoxical writer will ask if the peoples have not
      bestowed the title of executioner among their victims. It will not be the
      first time that humanity has preferred to immolate a god rather than admit
      its own guilt. You are shedding upon two hundred clowns, sacrificed for a
      purpose, the tears you refuse to a generation, a century, a world! You
      forget that political liberty, the tranquillity of a nation, nay,
      knowledge itself, are gifts on which destiny has laid a tax of blood!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I exclaimed, with tears in my eyes, &lsquo;will the nations never be
      happy at less cost?&rsquo; &lsquo;Truth never leaves her well but to bathe in the
      blood which refreshes her,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;Christianity, itself the essence
      of all truth, since it comes from God, was fed by the blood of martyrs,
      which flowed in torrents; and shall it not ever flow? You will learn this,
      you who are destined to be one of the builders of the social edifice
      founded by the Apostles. So long as you level heads you will be applauded,
      but take your trowel in hand, begin to reconstruct, and your fellows will
      kill you.&rsquo; Blood! blood! the word sounded in my ears like a knell.
      &lsquo;According to you,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;Protestantism has the right to reason as you
      do!&rsquo; But Catherine had disappeared, as if some puff of air had suddenly
      extinguished the supernatural light which enabled my mind to see that
      Figure whose proportions had gradually become gigantic. And then, without
      warning, I found within me a portion of myself which adopted the monstrous
      doctrine delivered by the Italian. I woke, weeping, bathed in sweat, at
      the moment when my reason told me firmly, in a gentle voice, that neither
      kings nor nations had the right to apply such principles, fit only for a
      world of atheists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you save a falling monarchy?&rdquo; asked Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is present,&rdquo; replied the little lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; remarked Monsieur de Calonne, with the inconceivable levity
      which characterized him, &ldquo;we have the agreeable resource of believing
      ourselves the instruments of God, according to the Gospel of Bossuet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the ladies discovered that the tale related only to a
      conversation between the queen and the lawyer, they had begun to whisper
      and to show signs of impatience,&mdash;interjecting, now and then, little
      phrases through his speech. &ldquo;How wearisome he is!&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear, when will he
      finish?&rdquo; were among those which reached my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the strange little man had ceased speaking the ladies too were
      silent; Monsieur Bodard was sound asleep; the surgeon, half drunk;
      Monsieur de Calonne was smiling at the lady next him. Lavoisier,
      Beaumarchais, and I alone had listened to the lawyer&rsquo;s dream. The silence
      at this moment had something solemn about it. The gleam of the candles
      seemed to me magical. A sentiment bound all three of us by some mysterious
      tie to that singular little man, who made me, strange to say, conceive,
      suddenly, the inexplicable influences of fanaticism. Nothing less than the
      hollow, cavernous voice of Beaumarchais&rsquo;s neighbor, the surgeon, could, I
      think, have roused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have dreamed,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him more attentively, and a feeling of some strange horror
      came over me. His livid skin, his features, huge and yet ignoble, gave an
      exact idea of what you must allow me to call the <i>scum</i> of the earth.
      A few bluish-black spots were scattered over his face, like bits of mud,
      and his eyes shot forth an evil gleam. The face seemed, perhaps, darker,
      more lowering than it was, because of the white hair piled like hoarfrost
      on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man must have buried many a patient,&rdquo; I whispered to my neighbor the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him with my dog,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate him involuntarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I despise him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we are unjust,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! to-morrow he may be as famous as Volange the actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Calonne here motioned us to look at the surgeon, with a
      gesture that seemed to say: &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll be very amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you dream of a queen?&rdquo; asked Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I dreamed of a People,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, with an emphasis which
      made us laugh. &ldquo;I was then in charge of a patient whose leg I was to
      amputate the next day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find the People in the leg of your patient?&rdquo; asked Monsieur de
      Calonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; replied the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How amusing!&rdquo; cried Madame de Genlis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was somewhat surprised,&rdquo; went on the speaker, without noticing the
      interruption, and sticking his hands into the gussets of his breeches, &ldquo;to
      hear something talking to me within that leg. I then found I had the
      singular faculty of entering the being of my patient. Once within his skin
      I saw a marvellous number of little creatures which moved, and thought,
      and reasoned. Some of them lived in the body of the man, others lived in
      his mind. His ideas were things which were born, and grew, and died; they
      were sick and well, and gay, and sad; they all had special countenances;
      they fought with each other, or they embraced each other. Some ideas
      sprang forth and went to live in the world of intellect. I began to see
      that there were two worlds, two universes,&mdash;the visible universe, and
      the invisible universe; that the earth had, like man, a body and a soul.
      Nature illumined herself for me; I felt her immensity when I saw the
      oceans of beings who, in masses and in species, spread everywhere, making
      one sole and uniform animated Matter, from the stone of the earth to God.
      Magnificent vision! In short, I found a universe within my patient. When I
      inserted my knife into his gangrened leg I cut into a million of those
      little beings. Oh! you laugh, madame; let me tell you that you are eaten
      up by such creatures&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No personalities!&rdquo; interposed Monsieur de Calonne. &ldquo;Speak for yourself
      and for your patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My patient, frightened by the cries of his animalcules, wanted to stop
      the operation; but I went on regardless of his remonstrances; telling him
      that those evil animals were already gnawing at his bones. He made a
      sudden movement of resistance, not understanding that what I did was for
      his good, and my knife slipped aside, entered my own body, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is stupid,&rdquo; said Lavoisier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is drunk,&rdquo; replied Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, gentlemen, my dream has a meaning,&rdquo; cried the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Bodard, waking up; &ldquo;my leg is asleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your animalcules must be dead,&rdquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man has a vocation,&rdquo; announced my little neighbor, who had stared
      imperturbably at the surgeon while he was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to yours,&rdquo; said the ugly man, &ldquo;what the action is to the word, the
      body to the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his tongue grew thick, his words were indistinct, and he said no more.
      Fortunately for us the conversation took another turn. At the end of half
      an hour we had forgotten the surgeon of the king&rsquo;s pages, who was fast
      asleep. Rain was falling in torrents as we left the supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lawyer is no fool,&rdquo; I said to Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but he is cold and dull. You see, however, that the provinces are
      still sending us worthy men who take a serious view of political theories
      and the history of France. It is a leaven which will rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your carriage here?&rdquo; asked Madame de Saint-James, addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I did not think that I should need it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-James then rang the bell, ordered her own carriage to be
      brought round, and said to the little lawyer in a low voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Robespierre, will you do me the kindness to drop Monsieur
      Marat at his own door?&mdash;for he is not in a state to go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, madame,&rdquo; replied Monsieur de Robespierre, with his finical
      gallantry. &ldquo;I only wish you had requested me to do something more
      difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
