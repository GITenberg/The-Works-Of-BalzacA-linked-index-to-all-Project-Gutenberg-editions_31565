    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. AN OLD MONASTERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, deputy of the Centre, forward! Quick step! march! if we want to be
      in time to dine with the others. Jump, marquis! there, that&rsquo;s right! why,
      you can skip across a stubble-field like a deer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were said by a huntsman peacefully seated at the edge of the
      forest of Ile-Adam, who was finishing an Havana cigar while waiting for
      his companion, who had lost his way in the tangled underbrush of the wood.
      At his side four panting dogs were watching, as he did, the personage he
      addressed. To understand how sarcastic were these exhortations, repeated
      at intervals, we should state that the approaching huntsman was a stout
      little man whose protuberant stomach was the evidence of a truly
      ministerial &ldquo;embonpoint.&rdquo; He was struggling painfully across the furrows
      of a vast wheat-field recently harvested, the stubble of which
      considerably impeded him; while to add to his other miseries the sun&rsquo;s
      rays, striking obliquely on his face, collected an abundance of drops of
      perspiration. Absorbed in the effort to maintain his equilibrium, he
      leaned, now forward, now back, in close imitation of the pitching of a
      carriage when violently jolted. The weather looked threatening. Though
      several spaces of blue sky still parted the thick black clouds toward the
      horizon, a flock of fleecy vapors were advancing with great rapidity and
      drawing a light gray curtain from east to west. As the wind was acting
      only on the upper region of the air, the atmosphere below it pressed down
      the hot vapors of the earth. Surrounded by masses of tall trees, the
      valley through which the hunter struggled felt like a furnace. Parched and
      silent, the forest seemed thirsty. The birds, even the insects, were
      voiceless; the tree-tops scarcely waved. Those persons who may still
      remember the summer of 1819 can imagine the woes of the poor deputy, who
      was struggling along, drenched in sweat, to regain his mocking friend. The
      latter, while smoking his cigar, had calculated from the position of the
      sun that it must be about five in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil are we?&rdquo; said the stout huntsman, mopping his forehead
      and leaning against the trunk of a tree nearly opposite to his companion,
      for he felt unequal to the effort of leaping the ditch between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me to ask you,&rdquo; said the other, laughing, as he lay among the
      tall brown brake which crowned the bank. Then, throwing the end of his
      cigar into the ditch, he cried out vehemently: &ldquo;I swear by Saint Hubert
      that never again will I trust myself in unknown territory with a
      statesman, though he be, like you, my dear d&rsquo;Albon, a college mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Philippe, have you forgotten your French? Or have you left your wits
      in Siberia?&rdquo; replied the stout man, casting a sorrowfully comic look at a
      sign-post about a hundred feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; cried Philippe, seizing his gun and springing with a bound
      into the field and thence to the post. &ldquo;This way, d&rsquo;Albon, this way,&rdquo; he
      called back to his friend, pointing to a broad paved path and reading
      aloud the sign: &ldquo;&lsquo;From Baillet to Ile-Adam.&rsquo; We shall certainly find the
      path to Cassan, which must branch from this one between here and
      Ile-Adam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, colonel,&rdquo; said Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon, replacing upon his head
      the cap with which he had been fanning himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward then, my respectable privy councillor,&rdquo; replied Colonel Philippe,
      whistling to the dogs, who seemed more willing to obey him than the public
      functionary to whom they belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware, marquis,&rdquo; said the jeering soldier, &ldquo;that we still have
      six miles to go? That village over there must be Baillet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried the marquis, &ldquo;go to Cassan if you must, but you&rsquo;ll
      go alone. I prefer to stay here, in spite of the coming storm, and wait
      for the horse you can send me from the chateau. You&rsquo;ve played me a trick,
      Sucy. We were to have had a nice little hunt not far from Cassan, and
      beaten the coverts I know. Instead of that, you have kept me running like
      a hare since four o&rsquo;clock this morning, and all I&rsquo;ve had for breakfast is
      a cup of milk. Now, if you ever have a petition before the Court, I&rsquo;ll
      make you lose it, however just your claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor discouraged huntsman sat down on a stone that supported the
      signpost, relieved himself of his gun and his gamebag, and heaved a long
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;France! such are thy deputies!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel de Sucy, laughing. &ldquo;Ah!
      my poor d&rsquo;Albon, if you had been like me six years in the wilds of Siberia&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more, but he raised his eyes to heaven as if that anguish were
      between himself and God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, march on!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If you sit still you are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I, Philippe? It is an old magisterial habit to sit still. On my
      honor! I&rsquo;m tired out&mdash;If I had only killed a hare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men presented a rather rare contrast: the public functionary was
      forty-two years of age and seemed no more than thirty, whereas the soldier
      was thirty, and seemed forty at the least. Both wore the red rosette of
      the officers of the Legion of honor. A few spare locks of black hair mixed
      with white, like the wing of a magpie, escaped from the colonel&rsquo;s cap,
      while handsome brown curls adorned the brow of the statesman. One was
      tall, gallant, high-strung, and the lines of his pallid face showed
      terrible passions or frightful griefs. The other had a face that was
      brilliant with health, and jovially worth of an epicurean. Both were
      deeply sun-burned, and their high gaiters of tanned leather showed signs
      of the bogs and the thickets they had just come through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Sucy, &ldquo;let us get on. A short hour&rsquo;s march, and
      we shall reach Cassan in time for a good dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to see you have never loved,&rdquo; replied the councillor, with a
      look that was pitifully comic; &ldquo;you are as relentless as article 304 of
      the penal code.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe de Sucy quivered; his broad brow contracted; his face became as
      sombre as the skies above them. Some memory of awful bitterness distorted
      for a moment his features, but he said nothing. Like all strong men, he
      drove down his emotions to the depths of his heart; thinking perhaps, as
      simple characters are apt to think, that there was something immodest in
      unveiling griefs when human language cannot render their depths and may
      only rouse the mockery of those who do not comprehend them. Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Albon had one of those delicate natures which divine sorrows, and are
      instantly sympathetic to the emotion they have involuntarily aroused. He
      respected his friend&rsquo;s silence, rose, forgot his fatigue, and followed him
      silently, grieved to have touched a wound that was evidently not healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, my friend,&rdquo; said Philippe, pressing his hand, and thanking him
      for his mute repentance by a heart-rending look, &ldquo;I will relate to you my
      life. To-day I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They continued their way in silence. When the colonel&rsquo;s pain seemed
      soothed, the marquis resumed his fatigue; and with the instinct, or rather
      the will, of a wearied man his eye took in the very depths of the forest;
      he questioned the tree-tops and examined the branching paths, hoping to
      discover some dwelling where he could ask hospitality. Arriving at a
      cross-ways, he thought he noticed a slight smoke rising among the trees;
      he stopped, looked more attentively, and saw, in the midst of a vast
      copse, the dark-green branches of several pine-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A house! a house!&rdquo; he cried, with the joy the sailor feels in crying
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang quickly into the copse, and the colonel, who had fallen
      into a deep reverie, followed him mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather get an omelet, some cottage bread, and a chair here,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;than go to Cassan for sofas, truffles, and Bordeaux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were an exclamation of enthusiasm, elicited from the
      councillor on catching sight of a wall, the white towers of which
      glimmered in the distance through the brown masses of the tree trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! this looks to me as if it had once been a priory,&rdquo; cried the
      marquis, as they reached a very old and blackened gate, through which they
      could see, in the midst of a large park, a building constructed in the
      style of the monasteries of old. &ldquo;How those rascals the monks knew how to
      choose their sites!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last exclamation was an expression of surprise and pleasure at the
      poetical hermitage which met his eyes. The house stood on the slope of the
      mountain, at the summit of which is the village of Nerville. The great
      centennial oaks of the forest which encircled the dwelling made the place
      an absolute solitude. The main building, formerly occupied by the monks,
      faced south. The park seemed to have about forty acres. Near the house lay
      a succession of green meadows, charmingly crossed by several clear
      rivulets, with here and there a piece of water naturally placed without
      the least apparent artifice. Trees of elegant shape and varied foliage
      were distributed about. Grottos, cleverly managed, and massive terraces
      with dilapidated steps and rusty railings, gave a peculiar character to
      this lone retreat. Art had harmonized her constructions with the
      picturesque effects of nature. Human passions seemed to die at the feet of
      those great trees, which guarded this asylum from the tumult of the world
      as they shaded it from the fires of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How desolate!&rdquo; thought Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon, observing the sombre expression
      which the ancient building gave to the landscape, gloomy as though a curse
      were on it. It seemed a fatal spot deserted by man. Ivy had stretched its
      tortuous muscles, covered by its rich green mantle, everywhere. Brown or
      green, red or yellow mosses and lichen spread their romantic tints on
      trees and seats and roofs and stones. The crumbling window-casings were
      hollowed by rain, defaced by time; the balconies were broken, the terraces
      demolished. Some of the outside shutters hung from a single hinge. The
      rotten doors seemed quite unable to resist an assailant. Covered with
      shining tufts of mistletoe, the branches of the neglected fruit-trees gave
      no sign of fruit. Grass grew in the paths. Such ruin and desolation cast a
      weird poesy on the scene, filling the souls of the spectators with dreamy
      thoughts. A poet would have stood there long, plunged in a melancholy
      reverie, admiring this disorder so full of harmony, this destruction which
      was not without its grace. Suddenly, the brown tiles shone, the mosses
      glittered, fantastic shadows danced upon the meadows and beneath the
      trees; fading colors revived; striking contrasts developed, the foliage of
      the trees and shrubs defined itself more clearly in the light. Then&mdash;the
      light went out. The landscape seemed to have spoken, and now was silent,
      returning to its gloom, or rather to the soft sad tones of an autumnal
      twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the palace of the Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; said the marquis, beginning to
      view the house with the eyes of a land owner. &ldquo;I wonder to whom it
      belongs! He must be a stupid fellow not to live in such an exquisite
      spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a woman sprang from beneath a chestnut-tree standing to
      the right of the gate, and, without making any noise, passed before the
      marquis as rapidly as the shadow of a cloud. This vision made him mute
      with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Albon, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rubbing my eyes to know if I am asleep or awake,&rdquo; replied the
      marquis, with his face close to the iron rails as he tried to get another
      sight of the phantom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be beneath that fig-tree,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the foliage of a
      tree which rose above the wall to the left of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She! who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; replied Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon. &ldquo;A strange woman rose up
      there, just before me,&rdquo; he said in a low voice; &ldquo;she seemed to come from
      the world of shades rather than from the land of the living. She is so
      slender, so light, so filmy, she must be diaphanous. Her face was as white
      as milk; her eyes, her clothes, her hair jet black. She looked at me as
      she flitted by, and though I may say I&rsquo;m no coward, that cold immovable
      look froze the blood in my veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she pretty?&rdquo; asked Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I could see nothing but the eyes in that face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let the dinner at Cassan go to the devil!&rdquo; cried the colonel.
      &ldquo;Suppose we stay here. I have a sudden childish desire to enter that
      singular house. Do you see those window-frames painted red, and the red
      lines on the doors and shutters? Doesn&rsquo;t the place look to you as if it
      belonged to the devil?&mdash;perhaps he inherited it from the monks. Come,
      let us pursue the black and white lady&mdash;forward, march!&rdquo; cried
      Philippe, with forced gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the two huntsmen heard a cry that was something like that
      of a mouse caught in a trap. They listened. The rustle of a few shrubs
      sounded in the silence like the murmur of a breaking wave. In vain they
      listened for other sounds; the earth was dumb, and kept the secret of
      those light steps, if, indeed, the unknown woman moved at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very singular!&rdquo; said Philippe, as they skirted the park wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends presently reached a path in the forest which led to the
      village of Chauvry. After following this path some way toward the main
      road to Paris, they came to another iron gate which led to the principal
      facade of the mysterious dwelling. On this side the dilapidation and
      disorder of the premises had reached their height. Immense cracks furrowed
      the walls of the house, which was built on three sides of a square.
      Fragments of tiles and slates lying on the ground, and the dilapidated
      condition of the roofs, were evidence of a total want of care on the part
      of the owners. The fruit had fallen from the trees and lay rotting on the
      ground; a cow was feeding on the lawn and treading down the flowers in the
      borders, while a goat browsed on the shoots of the vines and munched the
      unripe grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here all is harmony; the devastation seems organized,&rdquo; said the colonel,
      pulling the chain of a bell; but the bell was without a clapper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huntsmen heard nothing but the curiously sharp noise of a rusty
      spring. Though very dilapidated, a little door made in the wall beside the
      iron gates resisted all their efforts to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, this is getting to be exciting,&rdquo; said de Sucy to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were not a magistrate,&rdquo; replied Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon, &ldquo;I should think
      that woman was a witch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said the words, the cow came to the iron gate and pushed her warm
      muzzle towards them, as if she felt the need of seeing human beings. Then
      a woman, if that name could be applied to the indefinable being who
      suddenly issued from a clump of bushes, pulled away the cow by its rope.
      This woman wore on her head a red handkerchief, beneath which trailed long
      locks of hair in color and shape like the flax on a distaff. She wore no
      fichu. A coarse woollen petticoat in black and gray stripes, too short by
      several inches, exposed her legs. She might have belonged to some tribe of
      Red-Skins described by Cooper, for her legs, neck, and arms were the color
      of brick. No ray of intelligence enlivened her vacant face. A few whitish
      hairs served her for eyebrows; the eyes themselves, of a dull blue, were
      cold and wan; and her mouth was so formed as to show the teeth, which were
      crooked, but as white as those of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my good woman!&rdquo; called Monsieur de Sucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came very slowly to the gate, looking with a silly expression at the
      two huntsmen, the sight of whom brought a forced and painful smile to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we? Whose house is this? Who are you? Do you belong here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To these questions and several others which the two friends alternately
      addressed to her, she answered only with guttural sounds that seemed more
      like the growl of an animal than the voice of a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be deaf and dumb,&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bons-Hommes!&rdquo; cried the peasant woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see. This is, no doubt, the old monastery of the Bons-Hommes,&rdquo; said
      the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He renewed his questions. But, like a capricious child, the peasant woman
      colored, played with her wooden shoe, twisted the rope of the cow, which
      was now feeding peaceably, and looked at the two hunters, examining every
      part of their clothing; then she yelped, growled, and clucked, but did not
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said Philippe, looking at her fixedly, as if he meant
      to mesmerize her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genevieve,&rdquo; she said, laughing with a silly air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cow is the most intelligent being we have seen so far,&rdquo; said the
      marquis. &ldquo;I shall fire my gun and see if that will being some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as d&rsquo;Albon raised his gun, the colonel stopped him with a gesture,
      and pointed to the form of a woman, probably the one who had so keenly
      piqued his curiosity. At this moment she seemed lost in the deepest
      meditation, and was coming with slow steps along a distant pathway, so
      that the two friends had ample time to examine her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed in a ragged gown of black satin. Her long hair fell in
      masses of curls over her forehead, around her shoulders, and below her
      waist, serving her for a shawl. Accustomed no doubt to this disorder, she
      seldom pushed her hair from her forehead; and when she did so, it was with
      a sudden toss of her head which only for a moment cleared her forehead and
      eyes from the thick veil. Her gesture, like that of an animal, had a
      remarkable mechanical precision, the quickness of which seemed wonderful
      in a woman. The huntsmen were amazed to see her suddenly leap up on the
      branch of an apple-tree, and sit there with the ease of a bird. She
      gathered an apple and ate it; then she dropped to the ground with the
      graceful ease we admire in a squirrel. Her limbs possessed an elasticity
      which took from every movement the slightest appearance of effort or
      constraint. She played upon the turf, rolling herself about like a child;
      then, suddenly, she flung her feet and hands forward, and lay at full
      length on the grass, with the grace and natural ease of a young cat asleep
      in the sun. Thunder sounded in the distance, and she turned suddenly,
      rising on her hands and knees with the rapidity of a dog which hears a
      coming footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of this singular attitude was to separate into two heavy
      masses the volume of her black hair, which now fell on either side of her
      head, and allowed the two spectators to admire the white shoulders
      glistening like daisies in a field, and the throat, the perfection of
      which allowed them to judge of the other beauties of her figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she uttered a distressful cry and rose to her feet. Her movements
      succeeded each other with such airiness and grace that she seemed not a
      creature of this world but a daughter of the atmosphere, as sung in the
      poems of Ossian. She ran toward a piece of water, shook one of her legs
      lightly to cast off her shoe, and began to dabble her foot, white as
      alabaster, in the current, admiring, perhaps, the undulations she thus
      produced upon the surface of the water. Then she knelt down at the edge of
      the stream and amused herself, like a child, in casting in her long
      tresses and pulling them abruptly out, to watch the shower of drops that
      glittered down, looking, as the sunlight struck athwart them, like a
      chaplet of pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman is mad!&rdquo; cried the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse cry, uttered by Genevieve, seemed uttered as a warning to the
      unknown woman, who turned suddenly, throwing back her hair from either
      side of her face. At this instant the colonel and Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon could
      distinctly see her features; she, herself, perceiving the two friends,
      sprang to the iron railing with the lightness and rapidity of a deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; she said, in a soft, harmonious voice, the melody of which did
      not convey the slightest feeling or the slightest thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon admired the long lashes of her eyelids, the blackness of
      her eyebrows, and the dazzling whiteness of a skin devoid of even the
      faintest tinge of color. Tiny blue veins alone broke the uniformity of its
      pure white tones. When the marquis turned to his friend as if to share
      with him his amazement at the sight of this singular creature, he found
      him stretched on the ground as if dead. D&rsquo;Albon fired his gun in the air
      to summon assistance, crying out &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; and then endeavored to
      revive the colonel. At the sound of the shot, the unknown woman, who had
      hitherto stood motionless, fled away with the rapidity of an arrow,
      uttering cries of fear like a wounded animal, and running hither and
      thither about the meadow with every sign of the greatest terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon, hearing the rumbling of a carriage on the high-road to
      Ile-Adam, waved his handkerchief and shouted to its occupants for
      assistance. The carriage was immediately driven up to the old monastery,
      and the marquis recognized his neighbors, Monsieur and Madame de
      Granville, who at once gave up their carriage to the service of the two
      gentlemen. Madame de Granville had with her, by chance, a bottle of salts,
      which revived the colonel for a moment. When he opened his eyes he turned
      them to the meadow, where the unknown woman was still running and uttering
      her distressing cries. A smothered exclamation escaped him, which seemed
      to express a sense of horror; then he closed his eyes again, and made a
      gesture as if to implore his friend to remove him from that sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur and Madame de Granville placed their carriage entirely at the
      disposal of the marquis, assuring him courteously that they would like to
      continue their way on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that lady?&rdquo; asked the marquis, signing toward the unknown woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she comes from Moulins,&rdquo; replied Monsieur de Granville. &ldquo;She is
      the Comtesse de Vandieres, and they say she is mad; but as she has only
      been here two months I will not vouch for the truth of these hearsays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon thanked his friends, and placing the colonel in the
      carriage, started with him for Cassan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she!&rdquo; cried Philippe, recovering his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Albon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanie. Ah, dead and living, living and mad! I fancied I was dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prudent marquis, appreciating the gravity of the crisis through which
      his friend was passing, was careful not to question or excite him; he was
      only anxious to reach the chateau, for the change which had taken place in
      the colonel&rsquo;s features, in fact in his whole person, made him fear for his
      friend&rsquo;s reason. As soon, therefore, as the carriage had reached the main
      street of Ile-Adam, he dispatched the footman to the village doctor, so
      that the colonel was no sooner fairly in his bed at the chateau than the
      physician was beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If monsieur had not been many hours without food the shock would have
      killed him,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After naming the first precautions, the doctor left the room, to prepare,
      himself, a calming potion. The next day, Monsieur de Sucy was better, but
      the doctor still watched him carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will admit to you, monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have feared
      some affection of the brain. Monsieur de Sucy has received a violent
      shock; his passions are strong; but, in him, the first blow decides all.
      To-morrow he may be entirely out of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was not mistaken; and the following day he allowed the marquis
      to see his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear d&rsquo;Albon,&rdquo; said Philippe, pressing his hand, &ldquo;I am going to ask a
      kindness of you. Go to the Bons-Hommes, and find out all you can of the
      lady we saw there; and return to me as quickly as you can; I shall count
      the minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon mounted his horse at once, and galloped to the old abbey.
      When he arrived there, he saw before the iron gate a tall, spare man with
      a very kindly face, who answered in the affirmative when asked if he lived
      there. Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon then informed him of the reasons for his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! monsieur,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;was it you who fired that fatal shot?
      You very nearly killed my poor patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, I fired in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have done the countess less harm had you fired at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must not reproach each other, monsieur, for the sight of the
      countess has almost killed my friend, Monsieur de Sucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! can you mean Baron Philippe de Sucy?&rdquo; cried the doctor, clasping
      his hands. &ldquo;Did he go to Russia; was he at the passage of the Beresina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied d&rsquo;Albon, &ldquo;he was captured by the Cossacks and kept for five
      years in Siberia; he recovered his liberty a few months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, monsieur,&rdquo; said the master of the house, leading the marquis
      into a room on the lower floor where everything bore the marks of
      capricious destruction. The silken curtains beside the windows were torn,
      while those of muslin remained intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the tall old man, as they entered, &ldquo;the ravages committed
      by that dear creature, to whom I devote myself. She is my niece; in spite
      of the impotence of my art, I hope some day to restore her reason by
      attempting a method which can only be employed, unfortunately, by very
      rich people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, like all persons living in solitude who are afflicted with an ever
      present and ever renewed grief, he related to the marquis at length the
      following narrative, which is here condensed, and relieved of the many
      digressions made by both the narrator and the listener.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE PASSAGE OF THE BERESINA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marechal Victor, when he started, about nine at night, from the heights of
      Studzianka, which he had defended, as the rear-guard of the retreating
      army, during the whole day of November 28th, 1812, left a thousand men
      behind him, with orders to protect to the last possible moment whichever
      of the two bridges across the Beresina might still exist. This rear-guard
      had devoted itself to the task of saving a frightful multitude of
      stragglers overcome by the cold, who obstinately refused to leave the
      bivouacs of the army. The heroism of this generous troop proved useless.
      The stragglers who flocked in masses to the banks of the Beresina found
      there, unhappily, an immense number of carriages, caissons, and articles
      of all kinds which the army had been forced to abandon when effecting its
      passage of the river on the 27th and 28th of November. Heirs to such
      unlooked-for riches, the unfortunate men, stupid with cold, took up their
      abode in the deserted bivouacs, broke up the material which they found
      there to build themselves cabins, made fuel of everything that came to
      hand, cut up the frozen carcasses of the horses for food, tore the cloth
      and the curtains from the carriages for coverlets, and went to sleep,
      instead of continuing their way and crossing quietly during the night that
      cruel Beresina, which an incredible fatality had already made so
      destructive to the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apathy of these poor soldiers can only be conceived by those who
      remember to have crossed vast deserts of snow without other perspective
      than a snow horizon, without other drink than snow, without other bed than
      snow, without other food than snow or a few frozen beet-roots, a few
      handfuls of flour, or a little horseflesh. Dying of hunger, thirst,
      fatigue, and want of sleep, these unfortunates reached a shore where they
      saw before them wood, provisions, innumerable camp equipages, and
      carriages,&mdash;in short a whole town at their service. The village of
      Studzianka had been wholly taken to pieces and conveyed from the heights
      on which it stood to the plain. However forlorn and dangerous that refuge
      might be, its miseries and its perils only courted men who had lately seen
      nothing before them but the awful deserts of Russia. It was, in fact, a
      vast asylum which had an existence of twenty-four hours only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utter lassitude, and the sense of unexpected comfort, made that mass of
      men inaccessible to every thought but that of rest. Though the artillery
      of the left wing of the Russians kept up a steady fire on this mass,&mdash;visible
      like a stain now black, now flaming, in the midst of the trackless snow,&mdash;this
      shot and shell seemed to the torpid creatures only one inconvenience the
      more. It was like a thunderstorm, despised by all because the lightning
      strikes so few; the balls struck only here and there, the dying, the sick,
      the dead sometimes! Stragglers arrived in groups continually; but once
      here those perambulating corpses separated; each begged for himself a
      place near a fire; repulsed repeatedly, they met again, to obtain by force
      the hospitality already refused to them. Deaf to the voice of some of
      their officers, who warned them of probable destruction on the morrow,
      they spent the amount of courage necessary to cross the river in building
      that asylum of a night, in making one meal that they themselves doomed to
      be their last. The death that awaited them they considered no evil,
      provided they could have that one night&rsquo;s sleep. They thought nothing evil
      but hunger, thirst, and cold. When there was no more wood or food or fire,
      horrible struggles took place between fresh-comers and the rich who
      possessed a shelter. The weakest succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there came a moment when a number, pursued by the Russians, found
      only snow on which to bivouac, and these lay down to rise no more.
      Insensibly this mass of almost annihilated beings became so compact, so
      deaf, so torpid, so happy perhaps, that Marechal Victor, who had been
      their heroic defender by holding twenty thousand Russians under
      Wittgenstein at bay, was forced to open a passage by main force through
      this forest of men in order to cross the Beresina with five thousand
      gallant fellows whom he was taking to the emperor. The unfortunate
      malingerers allowed themselves to be crushed rather than stir; they
      perished in silence, smiling at their extinguished fires, without a
      thought of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until ten o&rsquo;clock that night that Marechal Victor reached the
      bank of the river. Before crossing the bridge which led to Zembin, he
      confided the fate of his own rear-guard now left in Studzianka to Eble,
      the savior of all those who survived the calamities of the Beresina. It
      was towards midnight when this great general, followed by one brave
      officer, left the cabin he occupied near the bridge, and studied the
      spectacle of that improvised camp placed between the bank of the river and
      Studzianka. The Russian cannon had ceased to thunder. Innumerable fires,
      which, amid that trackless waste of snow, burned pale and scarcely sent
      out any gleams, illumined here and there by sudden flashes forms and faces
      that were barely human. Thirty thousand poor wretches, belonging to all
      nations, from whom Napoleon had recruited his Russian army, were trifling
      away their lives with brutish indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us save them!&rdquo; said General Eble to the officer who accompanied him.
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning the Russians will be masters of Studzianka. We must
      burn the bridge the moment they appear. Therefore, my friend, take your
      courage in your hand! Go to the heights. Tell General Fournier he has
      barely time to evacuate his position, force a way through this crowd, and
      cross the bridge. When you have seen him in motion follow him. Find men
      you can trust, and the moment Fournier had crossed the bridge, burn,
      without pity, huts, equipages, caissons, carriages,&mdash;EVERYTHING!
      Drive that mass of men to the bridge. Compel all that has two legs to get
      to the other side of the river. The burning of everything&mdash;EVERYTHING&mdash;is
      now our last resource. If Berthier had let me destroy those damned camp
      equipages, this river would swallow only my poor pontoniers, those fifty
      heroes who will save the army, but who themselves will be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general laid his hand on his forehead and was silent. He felt that
      Poland would be his grave, and that no voice would rise to do justice to
      those noble men who stood in the water, the icy water of Beresina, to
      destroy the buttresses of the bridges. One alone of those heroes still
      lives&mdash;or, to speak more correctly, suffers&mdash;in a village,
      totally ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aide-de-camp started. Hardly had this generous officer gone a hundred
      yards towards Studzianka than General Eble wakened a number of his weary
      pontoniers, and began the work,&mdash;the charitable work of burning the
      bivouacs set up about the bridge, and forcing the sleepers, thus
      dislodged, to cross the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the young aide-de-camp reached, not without difficulty, the only
      wooden house still left standing in Studzianka.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This barrack seems pretty full, comrade,&rdquo; he said to a man whom he saw by
      the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can get in you&rsquo;ll be a clever trooper,&rdquo; replied the officer,
      without turning his head or ceasing to slice off with his sabre the bark
      of the logs of which the house was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Philippe?&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp, recognizing a friend by
      the tones of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Ha, ha! is it you, old fellow?&rdquo; replied Monsieur de Sucy, looking at
      the aide-de-camp, who, like himself, was only twenty-three years of age.
      &ldquo;I thought you were the other side of that cursed river. What are you here
      for? Have you brought cakes and wine for our dessert? You&rsquo;ll be welcome,&rdquo;
       and he went on slicing off the bark, which he gave as a sort of provender
      to his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking for your commander to tell him, from General Eble, to make
      for Zembin. You&rsquo;ll have barely enough time to get through that crowd of
      men below. I am going presently to set fire to their camp and force them
      to march.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You warm me up&mdash;almost! That news makes me perspire. I have two
      friends I MUST save. Ah! without those two to cling to me, I should be
      dead already. It is for them that I feed my horse and don&rsquo;t eat myself.
      Have you any food,&mdash;a mere crust? It is thirty hours since anything
      has gone into my stomach, and yet I have fought like a madman&mdash;just
      to keep a little warmth and courage in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Philippe, I have nothing&mdash;nothing! But where&rsquo;s your general,&mdash;in
      this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go there; the place is full of wounded. Go up the street;
      you&rsquo;ll find on your left a sort of pig-pen; the general is there.
      Good-bye, old fellow. If we ever dance a trenis on a Paris floor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not end his sentence; the north wind blew at that moment with such
      ferocity that the aide-de-camp hurried on to escape being frozen, and the
      lips of Major de Sucy stiffened. Silence reigned, broken only by the moans
      which came from the house, and the dull sound made by the major&rsquo;s horse as
      it chewed in a fury of hunger the icy bark of the trees with which the
      house was built. Monsieur de Sucy replaced his sabre in its scabbard, took
      the bridle of the precious horse he had hitherto been able to preserve,
      and led it, in spite of the animal&rsquo;s resistance, from the wretched fodder
      it appeared to think excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start, Bichette, we&rsquo;ll start! There&rsquo;s none but you, my beauty, who
      can save Stephanie. Ha! by and bye you and I may be able to rest&mdash;and
      die,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe, wrapped in a fur pelisse, to which he owed his preservation and
      his energy, began to run, striking his feet hard upon the frozen snow to
      keep them warm. Scarcely had he gone a few hundred yards from the village
      than he saw a blaze in the direction of the place where, since morning, he
      had left his carriage in charge of his former orderly, an old soldier.
      Horrible anxiety laid hold of him. Like all others who were controlled
      during this fatal retreat by some powerful sentiment, he found a strength
      to save his friends which he could not have put forth to save himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he reached a slight declivity at the foot of which, in a spot
      sheltered from the enemy&rsquo;s balls, he had stationed the carriage,
      containing a young woman, the companion of his childhood, the being most
      dear to him on earth. At a few steps distant from the vehicle he now found
      a company of some thirty stragglers collected around an immense fire,
      which they were feeding with planks, caisson covers, wheels, and broken
      carriages. These soldiers were, no doubt, the last comers of that crowd
      who, from the base of the hill of Studzianka to the fatal river, formed an
      ocean of heads intermingled with fires and huts,&mdash;a living sea,
      swayed by motions that were almost imperceptible, and giving forth a
      murmuring sound that rose at times to frightful outbursts. Driven by
      famine and despair, these poor wretches must have rifled the carriage
      before de Sucy reached it. The old general and his young wife, whom he had
      left lying in piles of clothes and wrapped in mantles and pelisses, were
      now on the snow, crouching before the fire. One door of the carriage was
      already torn off.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did the men about the fire hear the tread of the major&rsquo;s horse
      than a hoarse cry, the cry of famine, arose,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse! a horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those voices formed but one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back! back! look out for yourself!&rdquo; cried two or three soldiers, aiming
      at the mare. Philippe threw himself before his animal, crying out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You villains! I&rsquo;ll throw you into your own fire. There are plenty of dead
      horses up there. Go and fetch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a joker, that officer! One, two&mdash;get out of the way,&rdquo; cried
      a colossal grenadier. &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t, hey! Well, as you please, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s cry rose higher than the report of the musket. Philippe
      fortunately was not touched, but Bichette, mortally wounded, was
      struggling in the throes of death. Three men darted forward and dispatched
      her with their bayonets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannibals!&rdquo; cried Philippe, &ldquo;let me at any rate take the horse-cloth and
      my pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pistols, yes,&rdquo; replied the grenadier. &ldquo;But as for that horse-cloth, no!
      here&rsquo;s a poor fellow afoot, with nothing in his stomach for two days, and
      shivering in his rags. It is our general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe kept silence as he looked at the man, whose boots were worn out,
      his trousers torn in a dozen places, while nothing but a ragged
      fatigue-cap covered with ice was on his head. He hastened, however, to
      take his pistols. Five men dragged the mare to the fire, and cut her up
      with the dexterity of a Parisian butcher. The pieces were instantly seized
      and flung upon the embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major went up to the young woman, who had uttered a cry on recognizing
      him. He found her motionless, seated on a cushion beside the fire. She
      looked at him silently, without smiling. Philippe then saw the soldier to
      whom he had confided the carriage; the man was wounded. Overcome by
      numbers, he had been forced to yield to the malingerers who attacked him;
      and, like the dog who defended to the last possible moment his master&rsquo;s
      dinner, he had taken his share of the booty, and was now sitting beside
      the fire, wrapped in a white sheet by way of cloak, and turning carefully
      on the embers a slice of the mare. Philippe saw upon his face the joy
      these preparations gave him. The Comte de Vandieres, who, for the last few
      days, had fallen into a state of second childhood, was seated on a cushion
      beside his wife, looking fixedly at the fire, which was beginning to thaw
      his torpid limbs. He had shown no emotion of any kind, either at
      Philippe&rsquo;s danger, or at the fight which ended in the pillage of the
      carriage and their expulsion from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first de Sucy took the hand of the young countess, as if to show her
      his affection, and the grief he felt at seeing her reduced to such utter
      misery; then he grew silent; seated beside her on a heap of snow which was
      turning into a rivulet as it melted, he yielded himself up to the
      happiness of being warm, forgetting their peril, forgetting all things.
      His face assumed, in spite of himself, an expression of almost stupid joy,
      and he waited with impatience until the fragment of the mare given to his
      orderly was cooked. The smell of the roasting flesh increased his hunger,
      and his hunger silenced his heart, his courage, and his love. He looked,
      without anger, at the results of the pillage of his carriage. All the men
      seated around the fire had shared his blankets, cushions, pelisses, robes,
      also the clothing of the Comte and Comtesse de Vandieres and his own.
      Philippe looked about him to see if there was anything left in or near the
      vehicle that was worth saving. By the light of the flames he saw gold and
      diamonds and plate scattered everywhere, no one having thought it worth
      his while to take any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the individuals collected by chance around this fire maintained a
      silence that was almost horrible, and did nothing but what he judged
      necessary for his own welfare. Their misery was even grotesque. Faces,
      discolored by cold, were covered with a layer of mud, on which tears had
      made a furrow from the eyes to the beard, showing the thickness of that
      miry mask. The filth of their long beards made these men still more
      repulsive. Some were wrapped in the countess&rsquo;s shawls, others wore the
      trappings of horses and muddy saddlecloths, or masses of rags from which
      the hoar-frost hung; some had a boot on one leg and a shoe on the other;
      in fact, there were none whose costume did not present some laughable
      singularity. But in presence of such amusing sights the men themselves
      were grave and gloomy. The silence was broken only by the snapping of the
      wood, the crackling of the flames, the distant murmur of the camps, and
      the blows of the sabre given to what remained of Bichette in search of her
      tenderest morsels. A few miserable creatures, perhaps more weary than the
      rest, were sleeping; when one of their number rolled into the fire no one
      attempted to help him out. These stern logicians argued that if he were
      not dead his burns would warn him to find a safer place. If the poor
      wretch waked in the flames and perished, no one cared. Two or three
      soldiers looked at each other to justify their own indifference by that of
      others. Twice this scene had taken place before the eyes of the countess,
      who said nothing. When the various pieces of Bichette, placed here and
      there upon the embers, were sufficiently broiled, each man satisfied his
      hunger with the gluttony that disgusts us when we see it in animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first time I ever saw thirty infantrymen on one horse,&rdquo; cried
      the grenadier who had shot the mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only jest made that night which proved the national character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the great number of these poor soldiers wrapped themselves in what
      they could find and lay down on planks, or whatever would keep them from
      contact with the snow, and slept, heedless of the morrow. When the major
      was warm, and his hunger appeased, an invincible desire to sleep weighed
      down his eyelids. During the short moment of his struggle against that
      desire he looked at the young woman, who had turned her face to the fire
      and was now asleep, leaving her closed eyes and a portion of her forehead
      exposed to sight. She was wrapped in a furred pelisse and a heavy
      dragoon&rsquo;s cloak; her head rested on a pillow stained with blood; an
      astrakhan hood, kept in place by a handkerchief knotted round her neck,
      preserved her face from the cold as much as possible. Her feet were
      wrapped in the cloak. Thus rolled into a bundle, as it were, she looked
      like nothing at all. Was she the last of the &ldquo;vivandieres&rdquo;? Was she a
      charming woman, the glory of a lover, the queen of Parisian salons? Alas!
      even the eye of her most devoted friend could trace no sign of anything
      feminine in that mass of rags and tatters. Love had succumbed to cold in
      the heart of a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the thick veils of irresistible sleep, the major soon saw the
      husband and wife as mere points or formless objects. The flames of the
      fire, those outstretched figures, the relentless cold, waiting, not three
      feet distant from that fugitive heat, became all a dream. One importunate
      thought terrified Philippe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I sleep, we shall all die; I will not sleep,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible clamor and an explosion awoke him an hour later. The sense of
      his duty, the peril of his friend, fell suddenly on his heart. He uttered
      a cry that was like a roar. He and his orderly were alone afoot. A sea of
      fire lay before them in the darkness of the night, licking up the cabins
      and the bivouacs; cries of despair, howls, and imprecations reached their
      ears; they saw against the flames thousands of human beings with agonized
      or furious faces. In the midst of that hell, a column of soldiers was
      forcing its way to the bridge, between two hedges of dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the retreat of the rear-guard!&rdquo; cried the major. &ldquo;All hope is
      gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved your carriage, Philippe,&rdquo; said a friendly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning round, de Sucy recognized the young aide-de-camp in the flaring of
      the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! all is lost!&rdquo; replied the major, &ldquo;they have eaten my horse; and how
      can I make this stupid general and his wife walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a brand from the fire and threaten them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threaten the countess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp, &ldquo;I have scarcely time to get across
      that fatal river&mdash;and I MUST; I have a mother in France. What a
      night! These poor wretches prefer to lie here in the snow; half will allow
      themselves to perish in those flames rather than rise and move on. It is
      four o&rsquo;clock, Philippe! In two hours the Russians will begin to move. I
      assure you you will again see the Beresina choked with corpses. Philippe!
      think of yourself! You have no horses, you cannot carry the countess in
      your arms. Come&mdash;come with me!&rdquo; he said urgently, pulling de Sucy by
      the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend! abandon Stephanie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Sucy seized the countess, made her stand upright, shook her with the
      roughness of a despairing man, and compelled her to wake up. She looked at
      him with fixed, dead eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must walk, Stephanie, or we shall all die here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all answer the countess tried to drop again upon the snow and sleep.
      The aide-de-camp seized a brand from the fire and waved it in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will save her in spite of herself!&rdquo; cried Philippe, lifting the
      countess and placing her in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to implore the help of his friend. Together they lifted the
      old general, without knowing whether he were dead or alive, and put him
      beside his wife. The major then rolled over the men who were sleeping on
      his blankets, which he tossed into the carriage, together with some
      roasted fragments of his mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo; asked the aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drag them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Philippe, crossing his arms in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he was seized by a last despairing thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you,&rdquo; he said, grasping the sound arm of his orderly, &ldquo;I confide her
      for one hour. Remember that you must die sooner than let any one approach
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major then snatched up the countess&rsquo;s diamonds, held them in one hand,
      drew his sabre with the other, and began to strike with the flat of its
      blade such of the sleepers as he thought the most intrepid. He succeeded
      in awaking the colossal grenadier, and two other men whose rank it was
      impossible to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are done for!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the grenadier, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, death for death, wouldn&rsquo;t you rather sell your life for a pretty
      woman, and take your chances of seeing France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather sleep,&rdquo; said a man, rolling over on the snow, &ldquo;and if you
      trouble me again, I&rsquo;ll stick my bayonet into your stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the business, my colonel?&rdquo; said the grenadier. &ldquo;That man is
      drunk; he&rsquo;s a Parisian; he likes his ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is yours, my brave grenadier,&rdquo; cried the major, offering him a
      string of diamonds, &ldquo;if you will follow me and fight like a madman. The
      Russians are ten minutes&rsquo; march from here; they have horses; we are going
      up to their first battery for a pair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the sentinels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of us three&mdash;&rdquo; he interrupted himself, and turned to the
      aide-de-camp. &ldquo;You will come, Hippolyte, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of us,&rdquo; continued the major, &ldquo;will take care of the sentinel.
      Besides, perhaps they are asleep too, those cursed Russians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward! major, you&rsquo;re a brave one! But you&rsquo;ll give me a lift on your
      carriage?&rdquo; said the grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you don&rsquo;t leave your skin up there&mdash;If I fall, Hippolyte,
      and you, grenadier, promise me to do your utmost to save the countess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried the grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started for the Russian lines, toward one of the batteries which had
      so decimated the hapless wretches lying on the banks of the river. A few
      moments later, the gallop of two horses echoed over the snow, and the
      wakened artillery men poured out a volley which ranged above the heads of
      the sleeping men. The pace of the horses was so fleet that their steps
      resounded like the blows of a blacksmith on his anvil. The generous
      aide-de-camp was killed. The athletic grenadier was safe and sound.
      Philippe in defending Hippolyte had received a bayonet in his shoulder;
      but he clung to his horse&rsquo;s mane, and clasped him so tightly with his
      knees that the animal was held as in a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; cried the major, finding his orderly untouched, and the
      carriage in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are just, my officer, you will get me the cross for this,&rdquo; said
      the man. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve played a fine game of guns and sabres here, I can tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done nothing yet&mdash;Harness the horses. Take these ropes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grenadier, turn over those sleepers, and take their shawls and linen, to
      eke out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens! that&rsquo;s one dead,&rdquo; said the grenadier, stripping the first man he
      came to. &ldquo;Bless me! what a joke, they are all dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all; seems as if horse-meat must be indigestible if eaten with
      snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words made Philippe tremble. The cold was increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! to lose the woman I have saved a dozen times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major shook the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanie! Stephanie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame! we are saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; she repeated, sinking down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were harnessed as best they could. The major, holding his sabre
      in his well hand, with his pistols in his belt, gathered up the reins with
      the other hand and mounted one horse while the grenadier mounted the
      other. The orderly, whose feet were frozen, was thrown inside the
      carriage, across the general and the countess. Excited by pricks from a
      sabre, the horses drew the carriage rapidly, with a sort of fury, to the
      plain, where innumerable obstacles awaited it. It was impossible to force
      a way without danger of crushing the sleeping men, women, and even
      children, who refused to move when the grenadier awoke them. In vain did
      Monsieur de Sucy endeavor to find the swathe cut by the rear-guard through
      the mass of human beings; it was already obliterated, like the wake of a
      vessel through the sea. They could only creep along, being often stopped
      by soldiers who threatened to kill their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to reach the bridge?&rdquo; said the grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the cost of my life&mdash;at the cost of the whole world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then forward, march! you can&rsquo;t make omelets without breaking eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the grenadier of the guard urged the horses over men and bivouacs with
      bloody wheels and a double line of corpses on either side of them. We must
      do him the justice to say that he never spared his breath in shouting in
      stentorian tones,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out there, carrion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor wretches!&rdquo; cried the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! that or the cold, that or the cannon,&rdquo; said the grenadier, prodding
      the horses, and urging them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A catastrophe, which might well have happened to them much sooner, put a
      stop to their advance. The carriage was overturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; cried the imperturbable grenadier. &ldquo;Ho! ho! your man is
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Laurent!&rdquo; said the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laurent? Was he in the 5th chasseurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he was my cousin. Oh, well, this dog&rsquo;s life isn&rsquo;t happy enough to
      waste any joy in grieving for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage could not be raised; the horses were taken out with serious
      and, as it proved, irreparable loss of time. The shock of the overturn was
      so violent that the young countess, roused from her lethargy, threw off
      her coverings and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe, where are we?&rdquo; she cried in a gentle voice, looking about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only five hundred feet from the bridge. We are now going to cross the
      Beresina, Stephanie, and once across I will not torment you any more; you
      shall sleep; we shall be in safety, and can reach Wilna easily.&mdash;God
      grant that she may never know what her life has cost!&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe! you are wounded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too late! the fatal hour had come. The Russian cannon sounded the
      reveille. Masters of Studzianka, they could sweep the plain, and by
      daylight the major could see two of their columns moving and forming on
      the heights. A cry of alarm arose from the multitude, who started to their
      feet in an instant. Every man now understood his danger instinctively, and
      the whole mass rushed to gain the bridge with the motion of a wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians came down with the rapidity of a conflagration. Men, women,
      children, horses,&mdash;all rushed tumultuously to the bridge. Fortunately
      the major, who was carrying the countess, was still some distance from it.
      General Eble had just set fire to the supports on the other bank. In spite
      of the warnings shouted to those who were rushing upon the bridge, not a
      soul went back. Not only did the bridge go down crowded with human beings,
      but the impetuosity of that flood of men toward the fatal bank was so
      furious that a mass of humanity poured itself violently into the river
      like an avalanche. Not a cry was heard; the only sound was like the
      dropping of monstrous stones into the water. Then the Beresina was a mass
      of floating corpses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The retrograde movement of those who now fell back into the plain to
      escape the death before them was so violent, and their concussion against
      those who were advancing from the rear so terrible, that numbers were
      smothered or trampled to death. The Comte and Comtesse de Vandieres owed
      their lives to their carriage, behind which Philippe forced them, using it
      as a breastwork. As for the major and the grenadier, they found their
      safety in their strength. They killed to escape being killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hurricane of human beings, the flux and reflux of living bodies, had
      the effect of leaving for a few short moments the whole bank of the
      Beresina deserted. The multitude were surging to the plain. If a few men
      rushed to the river, it was less in the hope of reaching the other bank,
      which to them was France, than to rush from the horrors of Siberia.
      Despair proved an aegis to some bold hearts. One officer sprang from
      ice-cake to ice-cake, and reached the opposite shore. A soldier clambered
      miraculously over mounds of dead bodies and heaps of ice. The multitude
      finally comprehended that the Russians would not put to death a body of
      twenty thousand men, without arms, torpid, stupid, unable to defend
      themselves; and each man awaited his fate with horrible resignation. Then
      the major and the grenadier, the general and his wife, remained almost
      alone on the river bank, a few steps from the spot where the bridge had
      been. They stood there, with dry eyes, silent, surrounded by heaps of
      dead. A few sound soldiers, a few officers to whom the emergency had
      restored their natural energy, were near them. This group consisted of
      some fifty men in all. The major noticed at a distance of some two hundred
      yards the remains of another bridge intended for carriages and destroyed
      the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make a raft!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly uttered the words before the whole group rushed to the
      ruins, and began to pick up iron bolts, and screws, and pieces of wood and
      ropes, whatever materials they could find that were suitable for the
      construction of a raft. A score of soldiers and officers, who were armed,
      formed a guard, commanded by the major, to protect the workers against the
      desperate attacks which might be expected from the crowd, if their scheme
      was discovered. The instinct of freedom, strong in all prisoners,
      inspiring them to miraculous acts, can only be compared with that which
      now drove to action these unfortunate Frenchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Russians! the Russians are coming!&rdquo; cried the defenders to the
      workers; and the work went on, the raft increased in length and breadth
      and depth. Generals, soldiers, colonel, all put their shoulders to the
      wheel; it was a true image of the building of Noah&rsquo;s ark. The young
      countess, seated beside her husband, watched the progress of the work with
      regret that she could not help it; and yet she did assist in making knots
      to secure the cordage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the raft was finished. Forty men launched it on the river, a dozen
      others holding the cords which moored it to the shore. But no sooner had
      the builders seen their handiwork afloat, than they sprang from the bank
      with odious selfishness. The major, fearing the fury of this first rush,
      held back the countess and the general, but too late he saw the whole raft
      covered, men pressing together like crowds at a theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Savages!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it was I who gave you the idea of that raft. I have
      saved you, and you deny me a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A confused murmur answered him. The men at the edge of the raft, armed
      with long sticks, pressed with violence against the shore to send off the
      frail construction with sufficient impetus to force its way through
      corpses and ice-floes to the other shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder of heaven! I&rsquo;ll sweep you into the water if you don&rsquo;t take the
      major and his two companions,&rdquo; cried the stalwart grenadier, who swung his
      sabre, stopped the departure, and forced the men to stand closer in spite
      of furious outcries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall fall,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am falling,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Push off! push off!&mdash;Forward!&rdquo;
       resounded on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major looked with haggard eyes at Stephanie, who lifted hers to heaven
      with a feeling of sublime resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die with thee!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something even comical in the position of the men in possession
      of the raft. Though they were uttering awful groans and imprecations, they
      dared not resist the grenadier, for in truth they were so closely packed
      together, that a push to one man might send half of them overboard. This
      danger was so pressing that a cavalry captain endeavored to get rid of the
      grenadier; but the latter, seeing the hostile movement of the officer,
      seized him round the waist and flung him into the water, crying out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! my duck, do you want to drink? Well, then, drink!&mdash;Here are
      two places,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come, major, toss me the little woman and follow
      yourself. Leave that old fossil, who&rsquo;ll be dead by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; cried the voice of all, as one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, major, they are grumbling, and they have a right to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Vandieres threw off his wrappings and showed himself in his
      general&rsquo;s uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us save the count,&rdquo; said Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephanie pressed his hand, and throwing herself on his breast, she
      clasped him tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Vandieres recovered sufficient strength and presence of mind
      to spring upon the raft, whither Stephanie followed him, after turning a
      last look to Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major! will you take my place? I don&rsquo;t care a fig for life,&rdquo; cried the
      grenadier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve neither wife nor child nor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confide them to your care,&rdquo; said the major, pointing to the count and
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be easy; I&rsquo;ll care for them, as though they were my very eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The raft was now sent off with so much violence toward the opposite side
      of the river, that as it touched ground, the shock was felt by all. The
      count, who was at the edge of it, lost his balance and fell into the
      river; as he fell, a cake of sharp ice caught him, and cut off his head,
      flinging it to a great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See there! major!&rdquo; cried the grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe de Sucy fell to the ground, overcome with horror and fatigue.

      CHAPTER III. THE CURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor niece became insane,&rdquo; continued the physician, after a few
      moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;Ah! monsieur,&rdquo; he said, seizing the marquis&rsquo;s hand,
      &ldquo;life has been awful indeed for that poor little woman, so young, so
      delicate! After being, by dreadful fatality, separated from the grenadier,
      whose name was Fleuriot, she was dragged about for two years at the heels
      of the army, the plaything of a crowd of wretches. She was often, they
      tell me, barefooted, and scarcely clothed; for months together, she had no
      care, no food but what she could pick up; sometimes kept in hospitals,
      sometimes driven away like an animal, God alone knows the horrors that
      poor unfortunate creature has survived. She was locked up in a madhouse,
      in a little town in Germany, at the time her relatives, thinking her dead,
      divided her property. In 1816, the grenadier Fleuriot was at an inn in
      Strasburg, where she went after making her escape from the madhouse.
      Several peasants told the grenadier that she had lived for a whole month
      in the forest, where they had tracked her in vain, trying to catch her,
      but she had always escaped them. I was then staying a few miles from
      Strasburg. Hearing much talk of a wild woman caught in the woods, I felt a
      desire to ascertain the truth of the ridiculous stories which were current
      about her. What were my feelings on beholding my own niece! Fleuriot told
      me all he knew of her dreadful history. I took the poor man with my niece
      back to my home in Auvergne, where, unfortunately, I lost him some months
      later. He had some slight control over Madame de Vandieres; he alone could
      induce her to wear clothing. &lsquo;Adieu,&rsquo; that word, which is her only
      language, she seldom uttered at that time. Fleuriot had endeavored to
      awaken in her a few ideas, a few memories of the past; but he failed; all
      that he gained was to make her say that melancholy word a little oftener.
      Still, the grenadier knew how to amuse her and play with her; my hope was
      in him, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;she has found another creature, with whom she seems
      to have some strange understanding. It is a poor idiotic peasant-girl,
      who, in spite of her ugliness and stupidity, loved a man, a mason. The
      mason was willing to marry her, as she had some property. Poor Genevieve
      was happy for a year; she dressed in her best to dance with her lover on
      Sunday; she comprehended love; in her heart and soul there was room for
      that one sentiment. But the mason, Dallot, reflected. He found a girl with
      all her senses, and more land than Genevieve, and he deserted the poor
      creature. Since then she has lost the little intellect that love developed
      in her; she can do nothing but watch the cows, or help at harvesting. My
      niece and this poor girl are friends, apparently by some invisible chain
      of their common destiny, by the sentiment in each which has caused their
      madness. See!&rdquo; added Stephanie&rsquo;s uncle, leading the marquis to a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter then saw the countess seated on the ground between Genevieve&rsquo;s
      legs. The peasant-girl, armed with a huge horn comb, was giving her whole
      attention to the work of disentangling the long black hair of the poor
      countess, who was uttering little stifled cries, expressive of some
      instinctive sense of pleasure. Monsieur d&rsquo;Albon shuddered as he saw the
      utter abandonment of the body, the careless animal ease which revealed in
      the hapless woman a total absence of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe, Philippe!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the past horrors are nothing!&mdash;Is
      there no hope?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old physician raised his eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur,&rdquo; said the marquis, pressing his hand. &ldquo;My friend is
      expecting me. He will soon come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was really she!&rdquo; cried de Sucy at d&rsquo;Albon&rsquo;s first words. &ldquo;Ah! I
      still doubted it,&rdquo; he added, a few tears falling from his eyes, which were
      habitually stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is the Comtesse de Vandieres,&rdquo; replied the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel rose abruptly from his bed and began to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philippe!&rdquo; cried his friend, &ldquo;are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer ill,&rdquo; replied the colonel, simply. &ldquo;This news has quieted
      my suffering. What pain can I feel when I think of Stephanie? I am going
      to the Bons-Hommes, to see her, speak to her, cure her. She is free. Well,
      happiness will smile upon us&mdash;or Providence is not in this world.
      Think you that that poor woman could hear my voice and not recover
      reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has already seen you and not recognized you,&rdquo; said his friend,
      gently, for he felt the danger of Philippe&rsquo;s excited hopes, and tried to
      cast a salutary doubt upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel quivered; then he smiled, and made a motion of incredulity. No
      one dared to oppose his wish, and within a very short time he reached the
      old priory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he cried, on arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said her uncle, &ldquo;she is sleeping. See, here she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philippe then saw the poor insane creature lying on a bench in the sun.
      Her head was protected from the heat by a forest of hair which fell in
      tangled locks over her face. Her arms hung gracefully to the ground; her
      body lay easily posed like that of a doe; her feet were folded under her
      without effort; her bosom rose and fell at regular intervals; her skin,
      her complexion, had that porcelain whiteness, which we admire so much in
      the clear transparent faces of children. Standing motionless beside her,
      Genevieve held in her hand a branch which Stephanie had doubtless climbed
      a tall poplar to obtain, and the poor idiot was gently waving it above her
      sleeping companion, to chase away the flies and cool the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant-woman gazed at Monsieur Fanjat and the colonel; then, like an
      animal which recognizes its master, she turned her head slowly to the
      countess, and continued to watch her, without giving any sign of surprise
      or intelligence. The air was stifling; the stone bench glittered in the
      sunlight; the meadow exhaled to heaven those impish vapors which dance and
      dart above the herbage like silvery dust; but Genevieve seemed not to feel
      this all-consuming heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel pressed the hand of the doctor violently in his own. Tears
      rolled from his eyes along his manly cheeks, and fell to the earth at the
      feet of his Stephanie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the uncle, &ldquo;for two years past, my heart is broken day by
      day. Soon you will be like me. You may not always weep, but you will
      always feel your sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men understood each other; and again, pressing each other&rsquo;s hands,
      they remained motionless, contemplating the exquisite calmness which sleep
      had cast upon that graceful creature. From time to time she gave a sigh,
      and that sigh, which had all the semblance of sensibilities, made the
      unhappy colonel tremble with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Monsieur Fanjat, &ldquo;do not deceive yourself, monsieur; there is
      no meaning in her sigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who have ever watched for hours with delight the sleep of one who is
      tenderly beloved, whose eyes will smile to them at waking, can understand
      the sweet yet terrible emotion that shook the colonel&rsquo;s soul. To him, this
      sleep was an illusion; the waking might be death, death in its most awful
      form. Suddenly, a little goat jumped in three bounds to the bench, and
      smelt at Stephanie, who waked at the sound. She sprang to her feet, but so
      lightly that the movement did not frighten the freakish animal; then she
      caught sight of Philippe, and darted away, followed by her four-footed
      friend, to a hedge of elders; there she uttered the same little cry like a
      frightened bird, which the two men had heard near the other gate. Then she
      climbed an acacia, and nestling into its tufted top, she watched the
      stranger with the inquisitive attention of the forest birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, adieu, adieu,&rdquo; she said, without the soul communicating one single
      intelligent inflexion to the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was uttered impassively, as the bird sings his note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not recognize me!&rdquo; cried the colonel, in despair. &ldquo;Stephanie! it
      is Philippe, thy Philippe, PHILIPPE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the poor soldier went to the acacia; but when he was a few steps from
      it, the countess looked at him, as if defying him, although a slight
      expression of fear seemed to flicker in her eye; then, with a single bound
      she sprang from the acacia to a laburnum, and thence to a Norway fir,
      where she darted from branch to branch with extraordinary agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not pursue her,&rdquo; said Monsieur Fanjat to the colonel, &ldquo;or you will
      arouse an aversion which might become insurmountable. I will help you to
      tame her and make her come to you. Let us sit on this bench. If you pay no
      attention to her, she will come of her own accord to examine you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHE! not to know me! to flee me!&rdquo; repeated the colonel, seating himself
      on a bench with his back to a tree that shaded it, and letting his head
      fall upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said nothing. Presently, the countess came gently down the
      fir-tree, letting herself swing easily on the branches, as the wind swayed
      them. At each branch she stopped to examine the stranger; but seeing him
      motionless, she at last sprang to the ground and came slowly towards him
      across the grass. When she reached a tree about ten feet distant, against
      which she leaned, Monsieur Fanjat said to the colonel in a low voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take out, adroitly, from my right hand pocket some lumps of sugar you
      will feel there. Show them to her, and she will come to us. I will
      renounce in your favor my sole means of giving her pleasure. With sugar,
      which she passionately loves, you will accustom her to approach you, and
      to know you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she was a woman,&rdquo; said Philippe, sadly, &ldquo;she had no taste for sweet
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the colonel showed her the lump of sugar, holding it between the
      thumb and forefinger of his right hand, she again uttered her little wild
      cry, and sprang toward him; then she stopped, struggling against the
      instinctive fear he caused her; she looked at the sugar and turned away
      her head alternately, precisely like a dog whose master forbids him to
      touch his food until he has said a letter of the alphabet which he slowly
      repeats. At last the animal desire triumphed over fear. Stephanie darted
      to Philippe, cautiously putting out her little brown hand to seize the
      prize, touched the fingers of her poor lover as she snatched the sugar,
      and fled away among the trees. This dreadful scene overcame the colonel;
      he burst into tears and rushed into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has love less courage than friendship?&rdquo; Monsieur Fanjat said to him. &ldquo;I
      have some hope, Monsieur le baron. My poor niece was in a far worse state
      than that in which you now find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that possible?&rdquo; cried Philippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went naked,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel made a gesture of horror and turned pale. The doctor saw in
      that sudden pallor alarming symptoms; he felt the colonel&rsquo;s pulse, found
      him in a violent fever, and half persuaded, half compelled him to go to
      bed. Then he gave him a dose of opium to ensure a calm sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight days elapsed, during which Colonel de Sucy struggled against mortal
      agony; tears no longer came to his eyes. His soul, often lacerated, could
      not harden itself to the sight of Stephanie&rsquo;s insanity; but he covenanted,
      so to speak, with his cruel situation, and found some assuaging of his
      sorrow. He had the courage to slowly tame the countess by bringing her
      sweetmeats; he took such pains in choosing them, and he learned so well
      how to keep the little conquests he sought to make upon her instincts&mdash;that
      last shred of her intellect&mdash;that he ended by making her much TAMER
      than she had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning he went into the park, and if, after searching for her long,
      he could not discover on what tree she was swaying, nor the covert in
      which she crouched to play with a bird, nor the roof on which she might
      have clambered, he would whistle the well-known air of &ldquo;Partant pour la
      Syrie,&rdquo; to which some tender memory of their love attached. Instantly,
      Stephanie would run to him with the lightness of a fawn. She was now so
      accustomed to see him, that he frightened her no longer. Soon she was
      willing to sit upon his knee, and clasp him closely with her thin and
      agile arm. In that attitude&mdash;so dear to lovers!&mdash;Philippe would
      feed her with sugarplums. Then, having eaten those that he gave her, she
      would often search his pockets with gestures that had all the mechanical
      velocity of a monkey&rsquo;s motions. When she was very sure there was nothing
      more, she looked at Philippe with clear eyes, without ideas, with
      recognition. Then she would play with him, trying at times to take off his
      boots to see his feet, tearing his gloves, putting on his hat; she would
      even let him pass his hands through her hair, and take her in his arms;
      she accepted, but without pleasure, his ardent kisses. She would look at
      him silently, without emotion, when his tears flowed; but she always
      understood his &ldquo;Partant pour la Syrie,&rdquo; when he whistled it, though he
      never succeeded in teaching her to say her own name Stephanie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippe was sustained in his agonizing enterprise by hope, which never
      abandoned him. When, on fine autumn mornings, he found the countess
      sitting peacefully on a bench, beneath a poplar now yellowing, the poor
      lover would sit at her feet, looking into her eyes as long as she would
      let him, hoping ever that the light that was in them would become
      intelligent. Sometimes the thought deluded him that he saw those hard
      immovable rays softening, vibrating, living, and he cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanie! Stephanie! thou hearest me, thou seest me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she listened to that cry as to a noise, the soughing of the wind in
      the tree-tops, or the lowing of the cow on the back of which she climbed.
      Then the colonel would wring his hands in despair,&mdash;despair that was
      new each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, under a calm sky, amid the silence and peace of that rural
      haven, the doctor saw, from a distance, that the colonel was loading his
      pistols. The old man felt then that the young man had ceased to hope; he
      felt the blood rushing to his heart, and if he conquered the vertigo that
      threatened him, it was because he would rather see his niece living and
      mad than dead. He hastened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is for me,&rdquo; replied the colonel, pointing to a pistol already
      loaded, which was lying on the bench; &ldquo;and this is for her,&rdquo; he added, as
      he forced the wad into the weapon he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess was lying on the ground beside him, playing with the balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not know,&rdquo; said the doctor, coldly, concealing his terror,
      &ldquo;that in her sleep last night she called you: Philippe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She called me!&rdquo; cried the baron, dropping his pistol, which Stephanie
      picked up. He took it from her hastily, caught up the one that was on the
      bench, and rushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darling!&rdquo; said the doctor, happy in the success of his lie. He
      pressed the poor creature to his breast, and continued speaking to
      himself: &ldquo;He would have killed thee, selfish man! because he suffers. He
      does not love thee for thyself, my child! But we forgive, do we not? He is
      mad, out of his senses, but thou art only senseless. No, God alone should
      call thee to Him. We think thee unhappy, we pity thee because thou canst
      not share our sorrows, fools that we are!&mdash;But,&rdquo; he said, sitting
      down and taking her on his knee, &ldquo;nothing troubles thee; thy life is like
      that of a bird, of a fawn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke she darted upon a young blackbird which was hopping near them,
      caught it with a little note of satisfaction, strangled it, looked at it,
      dead in her hand, and flung it down at the foot of a tree without a
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, as soon as it was light, the colonel came down into the
      gardens, and looked about for Stephanie,&mdash;he believed in the coming
      happiness. Not finding her he whistled. When his darling came to him, he
      took her on his arm; they walked together thus for the first time, and he
      led her within a group of trees, the autumn foliage of which was dropping
      to the breeze. The colonel sat down. Of her own accord Stephanie placed
      herself on his knee. Philippe trembled with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he said, kissing her hands passionately, &ldquo;I am Philippe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, pressing her to him, &ldquo;dost thou feel my heart? It has
      beaten for thee alone. I love thee ever. Philippe is not dead; he is not
      dead, thou art on him, in his arms. Thou art MY Stephanie; I am thy
      Philippe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel quivered, for he fancied he saw his own excitement
      communicated to his mistress. His heart-rending cry, drawn from him by
      despair, that last effort of an eternal love, of a delirious passion, was
      successful, the mind of his darling was awaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Stephanie! Stephanie! we shall yet be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a cry of satisfaction, and her eyes brightened with a flash of
      vague intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows me!&mdash;Stephanie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart swelled; his eyelids were wet with tears. Then, suddenly, the
      countess showed him a bit of sugar she had found in his pocket while he
      was speaking to her. He had mistaken for human thought the amount of
      reason required for a monkey&rsquo;s trick. Philippe dropped to the ground
      unconscious. Monsieur Fanjat found the countess sitting on the colonel&rsquo;s
      body. She was biting her sugar, and testifying her pleasure by pretty
      gestures and affectations with which, had she her reason, she might have
      imitated her parrot or her cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my friend,&rdquo; said Philippe, when he came to his senses, &ldquo;I die every
      day, every moment! I love too well! I could still bear all, if, in her
      madness, she had kept her woman&rsquo;s nature. But to see her always a savage,
      devoid even of modesty, to see her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want opera madness, do you? something picturesque and pleasing,&rdquo; said
      the doctor, bitterly. &ldquo;Your love and your devotion yield before a
      prejudice. Monsieur, I have deprived myself for your sake of the sad
      happiness of watching over my niece; I have left to you the pleasure of
      playing with her; I have kept for myself the heaviest cares. While you
      have slept, I have watched, I have&mdash;Go, monsieur, go! abandon her!
      leave this sad refuge. I know how to live with that dear darling creature;
      I comprehend her madness, I watch her gestures, I know her secrets. Some
      day you will thank me for thus sending you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel left the old monastery, never to return but once. The doctor
      was horrified when he saw the effect he had produced upon his guest, whom
      he now began to love when he saw him thus. Surely, if either of the two
      lovers were worthy of pity, it was Philippe; did he not bear alone the
      burden of their dreadful sorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      After the colonel&rsquo;s departure the doctor kept himself informed about him;
      he learned that the miserable man was living on an estate near
      Saint-Germain. In truth, the baron, on the faith of a dream, had formed a
      project which he believed would yet restore the mind of his darling.
      Unknown to the doctor, he spent the rest of the autumn in preparing for
      his enterprise. A little river flowed through his park and inundated
      during the winter the marshes on either side of it, giving it some
      resemblance to the Beresina. The village of Satout, on the heights above,
      closed in, like Studzianka, the scene of horror. The colonel collected
      workmen to deepen the banks, and by the help of his memory, he copied in
      his park the shore where General Eble destroyed the bridge. He planted
      piles, and made buttresses and burned them, leaving their charred and
      blackened ruins, standing in the water from shore to shore. Then he
      gathered fragments of all kinds, like those of which the raft was built.
      He ordered dilapidated uniforms and clothing of every grade, and hired
      hundreds of peasants to wear them; he erected huts and cabins for the
      purpose of burning them. In short, he forgot nothing that might recall
      that most awful of all scenes, and he succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the last of December, when the snow had covered with its thick,
      white mantle all his imitative preparations, he recognized the Beresina.
      This false Russia was so terribly truthful, that several of his army
      comrades recognized the scene of their past misery at once. Monsieur de
      Sucy took care to keep secret the motive for this tragic imitation, which
      was talked of in several Parisian circles as a proof of insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in January, 1820, the colonel drove in a carriage, the very
      counterpart of the one in which he had driven the Comte and Comtesse de
      Vandieres from Moscow to Studzianka. The horses, too, were like those he
      had gone, at the peril of his life, to fetch from the Russian outposts. He
      himself wore the soiled fantastic clothing, the same weapons, as on the
      29th of November, 1812. He had let his beard grow, also his hair, which
      was tangled and matted, and his face was neglected, so that nothing might
      be wanting to represent the awful truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess your purpose,&rdquo; cried Monsieur Fanjat, when he saw the colonel
      getting out of the carriage. &ldquo;If you want to succeed, do not let my niece
      see you in that equipage. To-night I will give her opium. During her
      sleep, we will dress her as she was at Studzianka, and place her in the
      carriage. I will follow you in another vehicle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About two in the morning, the sleeping countess was placed in the carriage
      and wrapped in heavy coverings. A few peasants with torches lighted up
      this strange abduction. Suddenly, a piercing cry broke the silence of the
      night. Philippe and the doctor turned, and saw Genevieve coming half-naked
      from the ground-floor room in which she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, adieu! all is over, adieu!&rdquo; she cried, weeping hot tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genevieve, what troubles you?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genevieve shook her head with a motion of despair, raised her arm to
      heaven, looked at the carriage, uttering a long-drawn moan with every sign
      of the utmost terror; then she returned to her room silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good omen!&rdquo; cried the colonel. &ldquo;She feels she is to lose her
      companion. Perhaps she SEES that Stephanie will recover her reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it!&rdquo; said Monsieur Fanjat, who himself was affected by the
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since he had made a close study of insanity, the good man had met
      with many examples of the prophetic faculty and the gift of second sight,
      proofs of which are frequently given by alienated minds, and which may
      also be found, so travellers say, among certain tribes of savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the colonel had calculated, Stephanie crossed the fictitious plain of
      the Beresina at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when she was awakened by a
      cannon shot not a hundred yards from the spot where the experiment was to
      be tried. This was a signal. Hundreds of peasants made a frightful clamor
      like that on the shore of the river that memorable night, when twenty
      thousand stragglers were doomed to death or slavery by their own folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cry, at the shot, the countess sprang from the carriage, and ran,
      with delirious emotion, over the snow to the banks of the river; she saw
      the burned bivouacs and the charred remains of the bridge, and the fatal
      raft, which the men were launching into the icy waters of the Beresina.
      The major, Philippe, was there, striking back the crowd with his sabre.
      Madame de Vandieres gave a cry, which went to all hearts, and threw
      herself before the colonel, whose heart beat wildly. She seemed to gather
      herself together, and, at first, looked vaguely at the singular scene. For
      an instant, as rapid as the lightning&rsquo;s flash, her eyes had that lucidity,
      devoid of mind, which we admire in the eye of birds; then passing her hand
      across her brow with the keen expression of one who meditates, she
      contemplated the living memory of a past scene spread before her, and,
      turning quickly to Philippe, she SAW HIM. An awful silence reigned in the
      crowd. The colonel gasped, but dared not speak; the doctor wept.
      Stephanie&rsquo;s sweet face colored faintly; then, from tint to tint, it
      returned to the brightness of youth, till it glowed with a beautiful
      crimson. Life and happiness, lighted by intelligence, came nearer and
      nearer like a conflagration. Convulsive trembling rose from her feet to
      her heart. Then these phenomena seemed to blend in one as Stephanie&rsquo;s eyes
      cast forth a celestial ray, the flame of a living soul. She lived, she
      thought! She shuddered, with fear perhaps, for God himself unloosed that
      silent tongue, and cast anew His fires into that long-extinguished soul.
      Human will came with its full electric torrent, and vivified the body from
      which it had been driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephanie!&rdquo; cried the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is Philippe,&rdquo; said the poor countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself into the trembling arms that the colonel held out to
      her, and the clasp of the lovers frightened the spectators. Stephanie
      burst into tears. Suddenly her tears stopped, she stiffened as though the
      lightning had touched her, and said in a feeble voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Philippe; I love thee, adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she is dead,&rdquo; cried the colonel, opening his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor received the inanimate body of his niece, kissed it as
      though he were a young man, and carrying it aside, sat down with it still
      in his arms on a pile of wood. He looked at the countess and placed his
      feeble trembling hand upon her heart. That heart no longer beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said, looking up at the colonel, who stood motionless,
      and then at Stephanie, on whom death was placing that resplendent beauty,
      that fugitive halo, which is, perhaps, a pledge of the glorious future&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      she is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that smile,&rdquo; cried Philippe, &ldquo;do you see that smile? Can it be true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is turning cold,&rdquo; replied Monsieur Fanjat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Sucy made a few steps to tear himself away from the sight; but
      he stopped, whistled the air that Stephanie had known, and when she did
      not come to him, went on with staggering steps like a drunken man, still
      whistling, but never turning back.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Philippe de Sucy was thought in the social world to be a very
      agreeable man, and above all a very gay one. A few days ago, a lady
      complimented him on his good humor, and the charming equability of his
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I pay dear for my liveliness in my lonely
      evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ever alone?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a judicious observer of human nature could have seen at that moment the
      expression on the Comte de Sucy&rsquo;s face, he would perhaps have shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry?&rdquo; said the lady, who had several daughters at school.
      &ldquo;You are rich, titled, and of ancient lineage; you have talents, and a
      great future before you; all things smile upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a smile kills me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the lady heard with great astonishment that Monsieur de Sucy
      had blown his brains out during the night. The upper ranks of society
      talked in various ways over this extraordinary event, and each person
      looked for the cause of it. According to the proclivities of each
      reasoner, play, love, ambition, hidden disorders, and vices, explained the
      catastrophe, the last scene of a drama begun in 1812. Two men alone, a
      marquis and former deputy, and an aged physician, knew that Philippe de
      Sucy was one of those strong men to whom God has given the unhappy power
      of issuing daily in triumph from awful combats which they fight with an
      unseen monster. If, for a moment, God withdraws from such men His
      all-powerful hand, they succumb.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
