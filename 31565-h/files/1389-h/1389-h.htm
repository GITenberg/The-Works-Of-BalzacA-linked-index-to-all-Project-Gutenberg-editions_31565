                  To M. le Baron Barchou de Penhoen.

  Among all the pupils of the Oratorian school at Vendome, we are, I
  think, the only two who have afterwards met in mid-career of a
  life of letters&mdash;we who once were cultivating Philosophy when by
  rights we should have been minding our De viris. When we met, you
  were engaged upon your noble works on German philosophy, and I
  upon this study. So neither of us has missed his vocation; and
  you, when you see your name here, will feel, no doubt, as much
  pleasure as he who inscribes his work to you.&mdash;Your old
  schoolfellow,

       1840                                              De Balzac.

      It was one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, during the winter of 1829-30, but in
      the Vicomtesse de Grandlieu&rsquo;s salon two persons stayed on who did not
      belong to her family circle. A young and good-looking man heard the clock
      strike, and took his leave. When the courtyard echoed with the sound of a
      departing carriage, the Vicomtesse looked up, saw that no one was present
      save her brother and a friend of the family finishing their game of
      piquet, and went across to her daughter. The girl, standing by the
      chimney-piece, apparently examining a transparent fire-screen, was
      listening to the sounds from the courtyard in a way that justified certain
      maternal fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camille,&rdquo; said the Vicomtesse, &ldquo;if you continue to behave to young Comte
      de Restaud as you have done this evening, you will oblige me to see no
      more of him here. Listen, child, and if you have any confidence in my
      love, let me guide you in life. At seventeen one cannot judge of past or
      future, nor of certain social considerations. I have only one thing to say
      to you. M. de Restaud has a mother, a mother who would waste millions of
      francs; a woman of no birth, a Mlle. Goriot; people talked a good deal
      about her at one time. She behaved so badly to her own father, that she
      certainly does not deserve to have so good a son. The young Count adores
      her, and maintains her in her position with dutifulness worthy of all
      praise, and he is extremely good to his brother and sister.&mdash;But
      however admirable <i>his</i> behavior may be,&rdquo; the Vicomtesse added with a
      shrewd expression, &ldquo;so long as his mother lives, any family would take
      alarm at the idea of intrusting a daughter&rsquo;s fortune and future to young
      Restaud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overheard a word now and again in your talk with Mlle. de Grandlieu,&rdquo;
       cried the friend of the family, &ldquo;and it made me anxious to put in a word
      of my own.&mdash;I have won, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he added, turning to his
      opponent. &ldquo;I shall throw you over and go to your niece&rsquo;s assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what it is to have an attorney&rsquo;s ears!&rdquo; exclaimed the Vicomtesse. &ldquo;My
      dear Derville, how could you know what I was saying to Camille in a
      whisper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it from your looks,&rdquo; answered Derville, seating himself in a low
      chair by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camille&rsquo;s uncle went to her side, and Mme. de Grandlieu took up her
      position on a hearth stool between her daughter and Derville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come for telling a story, which should modify your judgment
      as to Ernest de Restaud&rsquo;s prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story?&rdquo; cried Camille. &ldquo;Do begin at once, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glance that Derville gave the Vicomtesse told her that this tale was
      meant for her. The Vicomtesse de Grandlieu, be it said, was one of the
      greatest ladies in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, by reason of her fortune
      and her ancient name; and though it may seem improbable that a Paris
      attorney should speak so familiarly to her, or be so much at home in her
      house, the fact is nevertheless easily explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mme. de Grandlieu returned to France with the Royal family, she came
      to Paris, and at first lived entirely on the pension allowed her out of
      the Civil List by Louis XVIII.&mdash;an intolerable position. The Hotel de
      Grandlieu had been sold by the Republic. It came to Derville&rsquo;s knowledge
      that there were flaws in the title, and he thought that it ought to return
      to the Vicomtesse. He instituted proceedings for nullity of contract, and
      gained the day. Encouraged by this success, he used legal quibbles to such
      purpose that he compelled some institution or other to disgorge the Forest
      of Liceney. Then he won certain lawsuits against the Canal d&rsquo;Orleans, and
      recovered a tolerably large amount of property, with which the Emperor had
      endowed various public institutions. So it fell out that, thanks to the
      young attorney&rsquo;s skilful management, Mme. de Grandlieu&rsquo;s income reached
      the sum of some sixty thousand francs, to say nothing of the vast sums
      returned to her by the law of indemnity. And Derville, a man of high
      character, well informed, modest, and pleasant in company, became the
      house-friend of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his conduct of Mme. de Grandlieu&rsquo;s affairs he had fairly earned the
      esteem of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and numbered the best families among
      his clients; but he did not take advantage of his popularity, as an
      ambitious man might have done. The Vicomtesse would have had him sell his
      practice and enter the magistracy, in which career advancement would have
      been swift and certain with such influence at his disposal; but he
      persistently refused all offers. He only went into society to keep up his
      connections, but he occasionally spent an evening at the Hotel de
      Grandlieu. It was a very lucky thing for him that his talents had been
      brought into the light by his devotion to Mme. de Grandlieu, for his
      practice otherwise might have gone to pieces. Derville had not an
      attorney&rsquo;s soul. Since Ernest de Restaud had appeared at the Hotel de
      Grandlieu, and he had noticed that Camille felt attracted to the young
      man, Derville had been as assiduous in his visits as any dandy of the
      Chausee-d&rsquo;Antin newly admitted to the noble Faubourg. At a ball only a few
      days before, when he happened to stand near Camille, and said, indicating
      the Count:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity that yonder youngster has not two or three million francs,
      is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a pity? I do not think so,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;M. de Restaud has
      plenty of ability; he is well educated, and the Minister, his chief,
      thinks well of him. He will be a remarkable man, I have no doubt. &lsquo;Yonder
      youngster&rsquo; will have as much money as he wishes when he comes into power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but suppose that he were rich already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich already?&rdquo; repeated Camille, flushing red. &ldquo;Why all the girls in the
      room would be quarreling for him,&rdquo; she said, glancing at the quadrilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; retorted the attorney, &ldquo;Mlle. de Grandlieu might not be the
      one towards whom his eyes are always turned? That is what that red color
      means! You like him, do you not? Come, speak out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camille suddenly rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves him,&rdquo; Derville thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that evening, Camille had been unwontedly attentive to the attorney,
      who approved of her liking for Ernest de Restaud. Hitherto, although she
      knew well that her family lay under great obligations to Derville, she had
      felt respect rather than real friendship for him, their relation was more
      a matter of politeness than of warmth of feeling; and by her manner, and
      by the tones of her voice, she had always made him sensible of the
      distance which socially lay between them. Gratitude is a charge upon the
      inheritance which the second generation is apt to repudiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This adventure,&rdquo; Derville began after a pause, &ldquo;brings the one romantic
      event in my life to my mind. You are laughing already,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;it
      seems so ridiculous, doesn&rsquo;t it, that an attorney should speak of a
      romance in his life? But once I was five-and-twenty, like everybody else,
      and even then I had seen some queer things. I ought to begin at the
      beginning by telling you about some one whom it is impossible that you
      should have known. The man in question was a usurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you grasp a clear notion of that sallow, wan face of his? I wish the
      <i>Academie</i> would give me leave to dub such faces the <i>lunar</i>
      type. It was like silver-gilt, with the gilt rubbed off. His hair was
      iron-gray, sleek, and carefully combed; his features might have been cast
      in bronze; Talleyrand himself was not more impassive than this
      money-lender. A pair of little eyes, yellow as a ferret&rsquo;s, and with scarce
      an eyelash to them, peered out from under the sheltering peak of a shabby
      old cap, as if they feared the light. He had the thin lips that you see in
      Rembrandt&rsquo;s or Metsu&rsquo;s portraits of alchemists and shrunken old men, and a
      nose so sharp at the tip that it put you in mind of a gimlet. His voice
      was so low; he always spoke suavely; he never flew into a passion. His age
      was a problem; it was hard to say whether he had grown old before his
      time, or whether by economy of youth he had saved enough to last him his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His room, and everything in it, from the green baize of the bureau to the
      strip of carpet by the bed, was as clean and threadbare as the chilly
      sanctuary of some elderly spinster who spends her days in rubbing her
      furniture. In winter time, the live brands of the fire smouldered all day
      in a bank of ashes; there was never any flame in his grate. He went
      through his day, from his uprising to his evening coughing-fit, with the
      regularity of a pendulum, and in some sort was a clockwork man, wound up
      by a night&rsquo;s slumber. Touch a wood-louse on an excursion across your sheet
      of paper, and the creature shams death; and in something the same way my
      acquaintance would stop short in the middle of a sentence, while a cart
      went by, to save the strain to his voice. Following the example of
      Fontenelle, he was thrifty of pulse-strokes, and concentrated all human
      sensibility in the innermost sanctuary of Self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His life flowed soundless as the sands of an hour-glass. His victims
      sometimes flew into a rage and made a great deal of noise, followed by a
      great silence; so is it in a kitchen after a fowl&rsquo;s neck has been wrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward evening this bill of exchange incarnate would assume ordinary
      human shape, and his metals were metamorphosed into a human heart. When he
      was satisfied with his day&rsquo;s business, he would rub his hands; his inward
      glee would escape like smoke through every rift and wrinkle of his face;&mdash;in
      no other way is it possible to give an idea of the mute play of muscle
      which expressed sensations similar to the soundless laughter of <i>Leather
      Stocking</i>. Indeed, even in transports of joy, his conversation was
      confined to monosyllables; he wore the same non-committal countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the neighbor Chance found for me in the house in the Rue de
      Gres, where I used to live when as yet I was only a second clerk finishing
      my third year&rsquo;s studies. The house is damp and dark, and boasts no
      courtyard. All the windows look on the street; the whole dwelling, in
      claustral fashion, is divided into rooms or cells of equal size, all
      opening upon a long corridor dimly lit with borrowed lights. The place
      must have been part of an old convent once. So gloomy was it, that the
      gaiety of eldest sons forsook them on the stairs before they reached my
      neighbor&rsquo;s door. He and his house were much alike; even so does the oyster
      resemble his native rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the one creature with whom he had any communication, socially
      speaking; he would come in to ask for a light, to borrow a book or a
      newspaper, and of an evening he would allow me to go into his cell, and
      when he was in the humor we would chat together. These marks of confidence
      were the results of four years of neighborhood and my own sober conduct.
      From sheer lack of pence, I was bound to live pretty much as he did. Had
      he any relations or friends? Was he rich or poor? Nobody could give an
      answer to these questions. I myself never saw money in his room. Doubtless
      his capital was safely stowed in the strong rooms of the Bank. He used to
      collect his bills himself as they fell due, running all over Paris on a
      pair of shanks as skinny as a stag&rsquo;s. On occasion he would be a martyr to
      prudence. One day, when he happened to have gold in his pockets, a double
      napoleon worked its way, somehow or other, out of his fob and fell, and
      another lodger following him up the stairs picked up the coin and returned
      it to its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t mine!&rsquo; said he, with a start of surprise. &lsquo;Mine indeed! If I
      were rich, should I live as I do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made his cup of coffee himself every morning on the cast-iron chafing
      dish which stood all day in the black angle of the grate; his dinner came
      in from a cookshop; and our old porter&rsquo;s wife went up at the prescribed
      hour to set his room in order. Finally, a whimsical chance, in which
      Sterne would have seen predestination, had named the man Gobseck. When I
      did business for him later, I came to know that he was about seventy-six
      years old at the time when we became acquainted. He was born about 1740,
      in some outlying suburb of Antwerp, of a Dutch father and a Jewish mother,
      and his name was Jean-Esther Van Gobseck. You remember how all Paris took
      an interest in that murder case, a woman named <i>La belle Hollandaise</i>?
      I happened to mention it to my old neighbor, and he answered without the
      slightest symptom of interest or surprise, &lsquo;She is my grandniece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the only remark drawn from him by the death of his sole
      surviving next of kin, his sister&rsquo;s granddaughter. From reports of the
      case I found that <i>La belle Hollandaise</i> was in fact named Sara Van
      Gobseck. When I asked by what curious chance his grandniece came to bear
      his surname, he smiled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The women never marry in our family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular creature, he had never cared to find out a single relative among
      four generations counted on the female side. The thought of his heirs was
      abhorrent to him; and the idea that his wealth could pass into other hands
      after his death simply inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a child, ten years old, when his mother shipped him off as a cabin
      boy on a voyage to the Dutch Straits Settlements, and there he knocked
      about for twenty years. The inscrutable lines on that sallow forehead kept
      the secret of horrible adventures, sudden panic, unhoped-for luck,
      romantic cross events, joys that knew no limit, hunger endured and love
      trampled under foot, fortunes risked, lost, and recovered, life endangered
      time and time again, and saved, it may be, by one of the rapid, ruthless
      decisions absolved by necessity. He had known Admiral Simeuse, M. de
      Lally, M. de Kergarouet, M. d&rsquo;Estaing, <i>le Bailli de Suffren</i>, M. de
      Portenduere, Lord Cornwallis, Lord Hastings, Tippoo Sahib&rsquo;s father, Tippoo
      Sahib himself. The bully who served Mahadaji Sindhia, King of Delhi, and
      did so much to found the power of the Mahrattas, had had dealings with
      Gobseck. Long residence at St. Thomas brought him in contact with Victor
      Hughes and other notorious pirates. In his quest of fortune he had left no
      stone unturned; witness an attempt to discover the treasure of that tribe
      of savages so famous in Buenos Ayres and its neighborhood. He had a
      personal knowledge of the events of the American War of Independence. But
      if he spoke of the Indies or of America, as he did very rarely with me,
      and never with anyone else, he seemed to regard it as an indiscretion and
      to repent of it afterwards. If humanity and sociability are in some sort a
      religion, Gobseck might be ranked as an infidel; but though I set myself
      to study him, I must confess, to my shame, that his real nature was
      impenetrable up to the very last. I even felt doubts at times as to his
      sex. If all usurers are like this one, I maintain that they belong to the
      neuter gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he adhere to his mother&rsquo;s religion? Did he look on Gentiles as his
      legitimate prey? Had he turned Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Mahometan,
      Brahmin, or what not? I never knew anything whatsoever about his religious
      opinions, and so far as I could see, he was indifferent rather than
      incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evening I went in to see this man who had turned himself to gold; the
      usurer, whom his victims (his clients, as he styled them) were wont to
      call Daddy Gobseck, perhaps ironically, perhaps by way of antiphrasis. He
      was sitting in his armchair, motionless as a statue, staring fixedly at
      the mantel-shelf, where he seemed to read the figures of his statements. A
      lamp, with a pedestal that had once been green, was burning in the room;
      but so far from taking color from its smoky light, his face seemed to
      stand out positively paler against the background. He pointed to a chair
      set for me, but not a word did he say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What thoughts can this being have in his mind?&rsquo; said I to myself. &lsquo;Does
      he know that a God exists; does he know there are such things as feeling,
      woman, happiness?&rsquo; I pitied him as I might have pitied a diseased
      creature. But, at the same time, I knew quite well that while he had
      millions of francs at his command, he possessed the world no less in idea&mdash;that
      world which he had explored, ransacked, weighed, appraised, and exploited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good day, Daddy Gobseck,&rsquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turned his face towards me with a slight contraction of his bushy,
      black eyebrows; this characteristic shade of expression in him meant as
      much as the most jubilant smile on a Southern face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You look just as gloomy as you did that day when the news came of the
      failure of that bookseller whose sharpness you admired so much, though you
      were one of his victims.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;One of his victims?&rsquo; he repeated, with a look of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. Did you not refuse to accept composition at the meeting of
      creditors until he undertook privately to pay you your debt in full; and
      did he not give you bills accepted by the insolvent firm; and then, when
      he set up in business again, did he not pay you the dividend upon those
      bills of yours, signed as they were by the bankrupt firm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He was a sharp one, but I had it out of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then have you some bills to protest? To-day is the 30th, I believe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the first time I had spoken to him of money. He looked ironically
      up at me; then in those bland accents, not unlike the husky tones which
      the tyro draws from a flute, he answered, &lsquo;I am amusing myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So you amuse yourself now and again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you imagine that the only poets in the world are those who print
      their verses?&rsquo; he asked, with a pitying look and shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Poetry in that head!&rsquo; thought I, for as yet I knew nothing of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What life could be as glorious as mine?&rsquo; he continued, and his eyes
      lighted up. &lsquo;You are young, your mental visions are colored by youthful
      blood, you see women&rsquo;s faces in the fire, while I see nothing but coals in
      mine. You have all sorts of beliefs, while I have no beliefs at all. Keep
      your illusions&mdash;if you can. Now I will show you life with the
      discount taken off. Go wherever you like, or stay at home by the fireside
      with your wife, there always comes a time when you settle down in a
      certain groove, the groove is your preference; and then happiness consists
      in the exercise of your faculties by applying them to realities. Anything
      more in the way of precept is false. My principles have been various,
      among various men; I had to change them with every change of latitude.
      Things that we admire in Europe are punishable in Asia, and a vice in
      Paris becomes a necessity when you have passed the Azores. There are no
      such things as hard-and-fast rules; there are only conventions adapted to
      the climate. Fling a man headlong into one social melting pot after
      another, and convictions and forms and moral systems become so many
      meaningless words to him. The one thing that always remains, the one sure
      instinct that nature has implanted in us, is the instinct of
      self-interest. If you had lived as long as I have, you would know that
      there is but one concrete reality invariable enough to be worth caring
      about, and that is&mdash;GOLD. Gold represents every form of human power.
      I have traveled. I found out that there were either hills or plains
      everywhere: the plains are monotonous, the hills a weariness;
      consequently, place may be left out of the question. As to manners; man is
      man all the world over. The same battle between the poor and the rich is
      going on everywhere; it is inevitable everywhere; consequently, it is
      better to exploit than to be exploited. Everywhere you find the man of
      thews and sinews who toils, and the lymphatic man who torments himself;
      and pleasures are everywhere the same, for when all sensations are
      exhausted, all that survives is Vanity&mdash;Vanity is the abiding
      substance of us, the <i>I</i> in us. Vanity is only to be satisfied by
      gold in floods. Our dreams need time and physical means and painstaking
      thought before they can be realized. Well, gold contains all things in
      embryo; gold realizes all things for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;None but fools and invalids can find pleasure in shuffling cards all
      evening long to find out whether they shall win a few pence at the end.
      None but driveling idiots could spend time in inquiring into all that is
      happening around them, whether Madame Such-an-One slept single on her
      couch or in company, whether she has more blood than lymph, more
      temperament than virtue. None but the dupes, who fondly imagine that they
      are useful to their like, can interest themselves in laying down rules for
      political guidance amid events which neither they nor any one else
      foresees, nor ever will foresee. None but simpletons can delight in
      talking about stage players and repeating their sayings; making the daily
      promenade of a caged animal over a rather larger area; dressing for
      others, eating for others, priding themselves on a horse or a carriage
      such as no neighbor can have until three days later. What is all this but
      Parisian life summed up in a few phrases? Let us find a higher outlook on
      life than theirs. Happiness consists either in strong emotions which drain
      our vitality, or in methodical occupation which makes existence like a bit
      of English machinery, working with the regularity of clockwork. A higher
      happiness than either consists in a curiosity, styled noble, a wish to
      learn Nature&rsquo;s secrets, or to attempt by artificial means to imitate
      Nature to some extent. What is this in two words but Science and Art, or
      passion or calm?&mdash;Ah! well, every human passion wrought up to its
      highest pitch in the struggle for existence comes to parade itself before
      me&mdash;as I live in calm. As for your scientific curiosity, a kind of
      wrestling bout in which man is never uppermost, I replace it by an insight
      into all the springs of action in man and woman. To sum up, the world is
      mine without effort of mine, and the world has not the slightest hold on
      me. Listen to this,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;I will tell you the history of my
      morning, and you will divine my pleasures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got up, pushed the bolt of the door, drew a tapestry curtain across it
      with a sharp grating sound of the rings on the rod, then he sat down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This morning,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I had only two amounts to collect; the rest of
      the bills that were due I gave away instead of cash to my customers
      yesterday. So much saved, you see, for when I discount a bill I always
      deduct two francs for a hired brougham&mdash;expenses of collection. A
      pretty thing it would be, would it not, if my clients were to set <i>me</i>
      trudging all over Paris for half-a-dozen francs of discount, when no man
      is my master, and I only pay seven francs in the shape of taxes?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The first bill for a thousand francs was presented by a young fellow, a
      smart buck with a spangled waistcoat, and an eyeglass, and a tilbury and
      an English horse, and all the rest of it. The bill bore the signature of
      one of the prettiest women in Paris, married to a Count, a great
      landowner. Now, how came that Countess to put her name to a bill of
      exchange, legally not worth the paper it was written upon, but practically
      very good business; for these women, poor things, are afraid of the
      scandal that a protested bill makes in a family, and would give themselves
      away in payment sooner than fail? I wanted to find out what that bill of
      exchange really represented. Was it stupidity, imprudence, love or
      charity?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The second bill, bearing the signature &ldquo;Fanny Malvaut,&rdquo; came to me from
      a linen-draper on the highway to bankruptcy. Now, no creature who has any
      credit with a bank comes to <i>me</i>. The first step to my door means
      that a man is desperately hard up; that the news of his failure will soon
      come out: and, most of all, it means that he has been everywhere else
      first. The stag is always at bay when I see him, and a pack of creditors
      are hard upon his track. The Countess lived in the Rue du Helder, and my
      Fanny in the Rue Montmartre. How many conjectures I made as I set out this
      morning! If these two women were not able to pay, they would show me more
      respect than they would show their own fathers. What tricks and grimaces
      would not the Countess try for a thousand francs! She would be so nice to
      me, she would talk to me in that ingratiating tone peculiar to endorsers
      of bills, she would pour out a torrent of coaxing words, perhaps she would
      beg and pray, and I...&rsquo; (here the old man turned his pale eyes upon me)&mdash;&lsquo;and
      I not to be moved, inexorable!&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;I am there as the avenger,
      the apparition of Remorse. So much for hypotheses. I reached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Madame la Comtesse is asleep,&rdquo; says the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"When can I see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"At twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Is Madame la Comtesse ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"No, sir, but she only came home at three o&rsquo;clock this morning from a
      ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"My name is Gobseck, tell her that I shall call again at twelve
      o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and I went out, leaving traces of my muddy boots on the carpet
      which covered the paved staircase. I like to leave mud on a rich man&rsquo;s
      carpet; it is not petty spite; I like to make them feel a touch of the
      claws of Necessity. In the Rue Montmartre I thrust open the old gateway of
      a poor-looking house, and looked into a dark courtyard where the sunlight
      never shines. The porter&rsquo;s lodge was grimy, the window looked like the
      sleeve of some shabby wadded gown&mdash;greasy, dirty, and full of holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Mlle. Fanny Malvaut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"She has gone out; but if you have come about a bill, the money is
      waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I will look in again,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as I knew that the porter had the money for me, I wanted to know
      what the girl was like; I pictured her as pretty. The rest of the morning
      I spent in looking at the prints in the shop windows along the boulevard;
      then, just as it struck twelve, I went through the Countess&rsquo; ante-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Madame has just this minute rung for me,&rdquo; said the maid; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      she can see you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I will wait,&rdquo; said I, and sat down in an easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Venetian shutters were opened, and presently the maid came hurrying
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Come in, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;From the sweet tone of the girl&rsquo;s voice, I knew that the mistress could
      not be ready to pay. What a handsome woman it was that I saw in another
      moment! She had flung an Indian shawl hastily over her bare shoulders,
      covering herself with it completely, while it revealed the bare outlines
      of the form beneath. She wore a loose gown trimmed with snowy ruffles,
      which told plainly that her laundress&rsquo; bills amounted to something like
      two thousand francs in the course of a year. Her dark curls escaped from
      beneath a bright Indian handkerchief, knotted carelessly about her head
      after the fashion of Creole women. The bed lay in disorder that told of
      broken slumber. A painter would have paid money to stay a while to see the
      scene that I saw. Under the luxurious hanging draperies, the pillow,
      crushed into the depths of an eider-down quilt, its lace border standing
      out in contrast against the background of blue silk, bore a vague impress
      that kindled the imagination. A pair of satin slippers gleamed from the
      great bear-skin rug spread by the carved mahogany lions at the bed-foot,
      where she had flung them off in her weariness after the ball. A crumpled
      gown hung over a chair, the sleeves touching the floor; stockings which a
      breath would have blown away were twisted about the leg of an easy-chair;
      while ribbon garters straggled over a settee. A fan of price, half
      unfolded, glittered on the chimney-piece. Drawers stood open; flowers,
      diamonds, gloves, a bouquet, a girdle, were littered about. The room was
      full of vague sweet perfume. And&mdash;beneath all the luxury and
      disorder, beauty and incongruity, I saw Misery crouching in wait for her
      or for her adorer, Misery rearing its head, for the Countess had begun to
      feel the edge of those fangs. Her tired face was an epitome of the room
      strewn with relics of past festival. The scattered gewgaws, pitiable this
      morning, when gathered together and coherent, had turned heads the night
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What efforts to drink of the Tantalus cup of bliss I could read in these
      traces of love stricken by the thunderbolt remorse&mdash;in this visible
      presentment of a life of luxury, extravagance, and riot. There were faint
      red marks on her young face, signs of the fineness of the skin; but her
      features were coarsened, as it were, and the circles about her eyes were
      unwontedly dark. Nature nevertheless was so vigorous in her, that these
      traces of past folly did not spoil her beauty. Her eyes glittered. She
      looked like some <i>Herodias</i> of da Vinci&rsquo;s (I have dealt in pictures),
      so magnificently full of life and energy was she; there was nothing
      starved nor stinted in feature or outline; she awakened desire; it seemed
      to me that there was some passion in her yet stronger than love. I was
      taken with her. It was a long while since my heart had throbbed; so I was
      paid then and there&mdash;for I would give a thousand francs for a
      sensation that should bring me back memories of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, finding a chair for me, &ldquo;will you be so good as to
      wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Until this time to-morrow, madame,&rdquo; I said, folding up the bill again.
      &ldquo;I cannot legally protest this bill any sooner.&rdquo; And within myself I said&mdash;&ldquo;Pay
      the price of your luxury, pay for your name, pay for your ease, pay for
      the monopoly which you enjoy! The rich have invented judges and courts of
      law to secure their goods, and the guillotine&mdash;that candle in which
      so many lie in silk, under silken coverlets, there is remorse, and
      grinding of teeth beneath a smile, and those fantastical lions&rsquo; jaws are
      gaping to set their fangs in your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Protest the bill! Can you mean it?&rdquo; she cried, with her eyes upon me;
      &ldquo;could you have so little consideration for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"If the King himself owed money to me, madame, and did not pay it, I
      should summons him even sooner than any other debtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;While we were speaking, somebody tapped gently at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I cannot see any one,&rdquo; she cried imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"But, Anastasie, I particularly wish to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Not just now, dear,&rdquo; she answered in a milder tone, but with no sign of
      relenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"What nonsense! You are talking to some one,&rdquo; said the voice, and in
      came a man who could only be the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Countess gave me a glance. I saw how it was. She was thoroughly in
      my power. There was a time, when I was young, and might perhaps have been
      stupid enough not to protest the bill. At Pondicherry, in 1763, I let a
      woman off, and nicely she paid me out afterwards. I deserved it; what call
      was there for me to trust her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"What does this gentleman want?&rdquo; asked the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I could see that the Countess was trembling from head to foot; the white
      satin skin of her throat was rough, &ldquo;turned to goose flesh,&rdquo; to use the
      familiar expression. As for me, I laughed in myself without moving a
      muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"This gentleman is one of my tradesmen,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Count turned his back on me; I drew the bill half out of my pocket.
      After that inexorable movement, she came over to me and put a diamond into
      my hands. &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We exchanged values, and I made my bow and went. The diamond was quite
      worth twelve hundred francs to me. Out in the courtyard I saw a swarm of
      flunkeys, brushing out their liveries, waxing their boots, and cleaning
      sumptuous equipages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"This is what brings these people to me!&rdquo; said I to myself. &ldquo;It is to
      keep up this kind of thing that they steal millions with all due
      formalities, and betray their country. The great lord, and the little man
      who apes the great lord, bathes in mud once for all to save himself a
      splash or two when he goes afoot through the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Just then the great gates were opened to admit a cabriolet. It was the
      same young fellow who had brought the bill to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Sir,&rdquo; I said, as he alighted, &ldquo;here are two hundred francs, which I beg
      you to return to Mme. la Comtesse, and have the goodness to tell her that
      I hold the pledge which she deposited with me this morning at her
      disposition for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He took the two hundred francs, and an ironical smile stole over his
      face; it was as if he had said, &ldquo;Aha! so she has paid it, has she? ...
      Faith, so much the better!&rdquo; I read the Countess&rsquo; future in his face. That
      good-looking, fair-haired young gentleman is a heartless gambler; he will
      ruin himself, ruin her, ruin her husband, ruin the children, eat up their
      portions, and work more havoc in Parisian salons than a whole battery of
      howitzers in a regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I went back to see Mlle. Fanny in the Rue Montmartre, climbed a very
      steep, narrow staircase, and reached a two-roomed dwelling on the fifth
      floor. Everything was as neat as a new ducat. I did not see a speck of
      dust on the furniture in the first room, where Mlle. Fanny was sitting.
      Mlle. Fanny herself was a young Parisian girl, quietly dressed, with a
      delicate fresh face, and a winning look. The arrangement of her neatly
      brushed chestnut hair in a double curve on her forehead lent a refined
      expression to blue eyes, clear as crystal. The broad daylight streaming in
      through the short curtains against the window pane fell with softened
      light on her girlish face. A pile of shaped pieces of linen told me that
      she was a sempstress. She looked like a spirit of solitude. When I held
      out the bill, I remarked that she had not been at home when I called in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"But the money was left with the porter&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I pretended not to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"You go out early, mademoiselle, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I very seldom leave my room; but when you work all night, you are
      obliged to take a bath sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I looked at her. A glance told me all about her life. Here was a girl
      condemned by misfortune to toil, a girl who came of honest farmer folk,
      for she had still a freckle or two that told of country birth. There was
      an indefinable atmosphere of goodness about her; I felt as if I were
      breathing sincerity and frank innocence. It was refreshing to my lungs.
      Poor innocent child, she had faith in something; there was a crucifix and
      a sprig or two of green box above her poor little painted wooden bedstead;
      I felt touched, or somewhat inclined that way. I felt ready to offer to
      charge no more than twelve per cent, and so give something towards
      establishing her in a good way of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"But maybe she has a little youngster of a cousin,&rdquo; I said to myself,
      &ldquo;who would raise money on her signature and sponge on the poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So I went away, keeping my generous impulses well under control; for I
      have frequently had occasion to observe that when benevolence does no harm
      to him who gives it, it is the ruin of him who takes. When you came in I
      was thinking that Fanny Malvaut would make a nice little wife; I was
      thinking of the contrast between her pure, lonely life and the life of the
      Countess&mdash;she has sunk as low as a bill of exchange already, she will
      sink to the lowest depths of degradation before she has done!&rsquo;&mdash;I
      scrutinized him during the deep silence that followed, but in a moment he
      spoke again. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;do you think that it is nothing to have
      this power of insight into the deepest recesses of the human heart, to
      embrace so many lives, to see the naked truth underlying it all? There are
      no two dramas alike: there are hideous sores, deadly chagrins, love
      scenes, misery that soon will lie under the ripples of the Seine, young
      men&rsquo;s joys that lead to the scaffold, the laughter of despair, and
      sumptuous banquets. Yesterday it was a tragedy. A worthy soul of a father
      drowned himself because he could not support his family. To-morrow is a
      comedy; some youngster will try to rehearse the scene of M. Dimanche,
      brought up to date. You have heard the people extol the eloquence of our
      latter day preachers; now and again I have wasted my time by going to hear
      them; they produced a change in my opinions, but in my conduct (as
      somebody said, I can&rsquo;t recollect his name), in my conduct&mdash;never!&mdash;Well,
      well; these good priests and your Mirabeaus and Vergniauds and the rest of
      them, are mere stammering beginners compared with these orators of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Often it is some girl in love, some gray-headed merchant on the verge of
      bankruptcy, some mother with a son&rsquo;s wrong-doing to conceal, some starving
      artist, some great man whose influence is on the wane, and, for lack of
      money, is like to lose the fruit of all his labors&mdash;the power of
      their pleading has made me shudder. Sublime actors such as these play for
      me, for an audience of one, and they cannot deceive me. I can look into
      their inmost thoughts, and read them as God reads them. Nothing is hidden
      from me. Nothing is refused to the holder of the purse-strings to loose
      and to bind. I am rich enough to buy the consciences of those who control
      the action of ministers, from their office boys to their mistresses. Is
      not that power?&mdash;I can possess the fairest women, receive their
      softest caresses; is not that Pleasure? And is not your whole social
      economy summed up in terms of Power and Pleasure?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are ten of us in Paris, silent, unknown kings, the arbiters of
      your destinies. What is life but a machine set in motion by money? Know
      this for certain&mdash;methods are always confounded with results; you
      will never succeed in separating the soul from the senses, spirit from
      matter. Gold is the spiritual basis of existing society.&mdash;The ten of
      us are bound by the ties of common interest; we meet on certain days of
      the week at the Cafe Themis near the Pont Neuf, and there, in conclave, we
      reveal the mysteries of finance. No fortune can deceive us; we are in
      possession of family secrets in all directions. We keep a kind of Black
      Book, in which we note the most important bills issued, drafts on public
      credit, or on banks, or given and taken in the course of business. We are
      the Casuists of the Paris Bourse, a kind of Inquisition weighing and
      analyzing the most insignificant actions of every man of any fortune, and
      our forecasts are infallible. One of us looks out over the judicial world,
      one over the financial, another surveys the administrative, and yet
      another the business world. I myself keep an eye on eldest sons, artists,
      people in the great world, and gamblers&mdash;on the most sensational side
      of Paris. Every one who comes to us lets us into his neighbor&rsquo;s secrets.
      Thwarted passion and mortified vanity are great babblers. Vice and
      disappointment and vindictiveness are the best of all detectives. My
      colleagues, like myself, have enjoyed all things, are sated with all
      things, and have reached the point when power and money are loved for
      their own sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, indicating his bare, chilly room, &lsquo;here the most
      high-mettled gallant, who chafes at a word and draws swords for a syllable
      elsewhere will entreat with clasped hands. There is no city merchant so
      proud, no woman so vain of her beauty, no soldier of so bold a spirit, but
      that they entreat me here, one and all, with tears of rage or anguish in
      their eyes. Here they kneel&mdash;the famous artist, and the man of
      letters, whose name will go down to posterity. Here, in short&rsquo; (he lifted
      his hand to his forehead), &lsquo;all the inheritances and all the concerns of
      all Paris are weighed in the balance. Are you still of the opinion that
      there are no delights behind the blank mask which so often has amazed you
      by its impassiveness?&rsquo; he asked, stretching out that livid face which
      reeked of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went back to my room, feeling stupefied. The little, wizened old man
      had grown great. He had been metamorphosed under my eyes into a strange
      visionary symbol; he had come to be the power of gold personified. I
      shrank, shuddering, from life and my kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is it really so?&rsquo; I thought; &lsquo;must everything be resolved into gold?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that it was long before I slept that night. I saw heaps of
      gold all about me. My thoughts were full of the lovely Countess; I
      confess, to my shame, that the vision completely eclipsed another quiet,
      innocent figure, the figure of the woman who had entered upon a life of
      toil and obscurity; but on the morrow, through the clouds of slumber,
      Fanny&rsquo;s sweet face rose before me in all its beauty, and I thought of
      nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a glass of <i>eau sucree</i>?&rdquo; asked the Vicomtesse,
      interrupting Derville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can see nothing in this that can touch our concerns,&rdquo; said Mme. de
      Grandlieu, as she rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sardanapalus!&rdquo; cried Derville, flinging out his favorite invocation.
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Camille will be wide awake in a moment if I say that her
      happiness depended not so long ago upon Daddy Gobseck; but as the old
      gentleman died at the age of ninety, M. de Restaud will soon be in
      possession of a handsome fortune. This requires some explanation. As for
      poor Fanny Malvaut, you know her; she is my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow, he would admit that, with his usual frankness, with a score
      of people to hear him!&rdquo; said the Vicomtesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would proclaim it to the universe,&rdquo; said the attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, drink your glass, my poor Derville. You will never be anything but
      the happiest and the best of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left you in the Rue du Helder,&rdquo; remarked the uncle, raising his face
      after a gentle doze. &ldquo;You had gone to see a Countess; what have you done
      with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days after my conversation with the old Dutchman,&rdquo; Derville
      continued, &ldquo;I sent in my thesis, and became first a licentiate in law, and
      afterwards an advocate. The old miser&rsquo;s opinion of me went up
      considerably. He consulted me (gratuitously) on all the ticklish bits of
      business which he undertook when he had made quite sure how he stood,
      business which would have seemed unsafe to any ordinary practitioner. This
      man, over whom no one appeared to have the slightest influence, listened
      to my advice with something like respect. It is true that he always found
      that it turned out very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length I became head-clerk in the office where I had worked for three
      years and then I left the Rue des Gres for rooms in my employer&rsquo;s house. I
      had my board and lodging and a hundred and fifty francs per month. It was
      a great day for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I went to bid the usurer good-bye, he showed no sign of feeling, he
      was neither cordial nor sorry to lose me, he did not ask me to come to see
      him, and only gave me one of those glances which seemed in some sort to
      reveal a power of second-sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the end of a week my old neighbor came to see me with a tolerably
      thorny bit of business, an expropriation, and he continued to ask for my
      advice with as much freedom as if he paid for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My principal was a man of pleasure and expensive tastes; before the
      second year (1818-1819) was out he had got himself into difficulties, and
      was obliged to sell his practice. A professional connection in those days
      did not fetch the present exorbitant prices, and my principal asked a
      hundred and fifty thousand francs. Now an active man, of competent
      knowledge and intelligence, might hope to pay off the capital in ten
      years, paying interest and living respectably in the meantime&mdash;if he
      could command confidence. But I as the seventh child of a small tradesman
      at Noyon, I had not a sou to my name, nor personal knowledge of any
      capitalist but Daddy Gobseck. An ambitious idea, and an indefinable
      glimmer of hope, put heart into me. To Gobseck I betook myself, and slowly
      one evening I made my way to the Rue des Gres. My heart thumped heavily as
      I knocked at his door in the gloomy house. I recollected all the things
      that he used to tell me, at a time when I myself was very far from
      suspecting the violence of the anguish awaiting those who crossed his
      threshold. Now it was I who was about to beg and pray like so many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, no, not <i>that</i>,&rsquo; I said to myself; &lsquo;an honest man must keep
      his self-respect wherever he goes. Success is not worth cringing for; let
      us show him a front as decided as his own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Gobseck had taken my room since I left the house, so as to have no
      neighbor; he had made a little grated window too in his door since then,
      and did not open until he had taken a look at me and saw who I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, in his thin, flute notes, &lsquo;so your principal is selling
      his practice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How did you know that?&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;he has not spoken of it as yet except
      to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s lips were drawn in puckers, like a curtain, to either
      corner of his mouth, as a soundless smile bore a hard glance company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing else would have brought you here,&rsquo; he said drily, after a pause,
      which I spent in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Listen to me, M. Gobseck,&rsquo; I began, with such serenity as I could assume
      before the old man, who gazed at me with steady eyes. There was a clear
      light burning in them that disconcerted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made a gesture as if to bid me &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; &lsquo;I know that it is not easy to
      work on your feelings, so I will not waste my eloquence on the attempt to
      put my position before you&mdash;I am a penniless clerk, with no one to
      look to but you, and no heart in the world but yours can form a clear idea
      of my probable future. Let us leave hearts out of the question. Business
      is business, and business is not carried on with sentimentality like
      romances. Now to the facts. My principal&rsquo;s practice is worth in his hands
      about twenty thousand francs per annum; in my hands, I think it would
      bring in forty thousand. He is willing to sell it for a hundred and fifty
      thousand francs. And <i>here</i>,&rsquo; I said, striking my forehead, &lsquo;I feel
      that if you would lend me the purchase-money, I could clear it off in ten
      years&rsquo; time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, that is plain speaking,&rsquo; said Daddy Gobseck, and he held out his
      hand and grasped mine. &lsquo;Nobody since I have been in business has stated
      the motives of his visit more clearly. Guarantees?&rsquo; asked he, scanning me
      from head to foot. &lsquo;None to give,&rsquo; he added after a pause, &lsquo;How old are
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twenty-five in ten days&rsquo; time,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or I could not open the
      matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My word, we must be quick about it, or I shall have some one buying over
      my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bring your certificate of birth round to-morrow morning, and we will
      talk. I will think it over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Next morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, I stood in the old man&rsquo;s room. He took
      the document, put on his spectacles, coughed, spat, wrapped himself up in
      his black greatcoat, and read the whole certificate through from beginning
      to end. Then he turned it over and over, looked at me, coughed again,
      fidgeted about in his chair, and said, &lsquo;We will try to arrange this bit of
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I make fifty per cent on my capital,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;sometimes I make a
      hundred, two hundred, five hundred per cent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned pale at the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But as we are acquaintances, I shall be satisfied to take twelve and a
      half per cent per&mdash;(he hesitated)&mdash;&lsquo;well, yes, from you I would
      be content to take thirteen per cent per annum. Will that suit you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But if it is too much, stick up for yourself, Grotius!&rsquo; (a name he
      jokingly gave me). &lsquo;When I ask you for thirteen per cent, it is all in the
      way of business; look into it, see if you can pay it; I don&rsquo;t like a man
      to agree too easily. Is it too much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I will make up for it by working a little harder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gad! your clients will pay for it!&rsquo; said he, looking at me wickedly out
      of the corner of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, by all the devils in hell!&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;it shall be I who will pay. I
      would sooner cut my hand off than flay people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said Daddy Gobseck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, fees are all according to scale,&rsquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not for compromises and settlements out of Court, and cases where
      litigants come to terms,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You can send in a bill for thousands
      of francs, six thousand even at a swoop (it depends on the importance of
      the case), for conferences with So-and-so, and expenses, and drafts, and
      memorials, and your jargon. A man must learn to look out for business of
      this kind. I will recommend you as a most competent, clever attorney. I
      will send you such a lot of work of this sort that your colleagues will be
      fit to burst with envy. Werbrust, Palma, and Gigonnet, my cronies, shall
      hand over their expropriations to you; they have plenty of them, the Lord
      knows! So you will have two practices&mdash;the one you are buying, and
      the other I will build up for you. You ought almost to pay me fifteen per
      cent on my loan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So be it, but no more,&rsquo; said I, with the firmness which means that a man
      is determined not to concede another point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy Gobseck&rsquo;s face relaxed; he looked pleased with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall pay the money over to your principal myself,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;so as to
      establish a lien on the purchase and caution-money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, anything you like in the way of guarantees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And besides that, you will give me bills for the amount made payable to
      a third party (name left blank), fifteen bills of ten thousand francs
      each.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, so long as it is acknowledged in writing that this is a double&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; Gobseck broke in upon me. &lsquo;No! Why should I trust you any more than
      you trust me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And furthermore,&rsquo; he continued, with a sort of good humor, &lsquo;you will
      give me your advice without charging fees as long as I live, will you
      not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So be it; so long as there is no outlay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; said he. &ldquo;Ah, by the by, you will allow me to go to see
      you?&rsquo; (Plainly the old man found it not so easy to assume the air of
      good-humor.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall always be glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! yes, but it would be very difficult to arrange of a morning. You
      will have your affairs to attend to, and I have mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then come in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; he answered briskly, &lsquo;you ought to go into society and see your
      clients, and I myself have my friends at my cafe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His friends!&rsquo; thought I to myself.&mdash;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;why not
      come at dinner-time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is the time,&rsquo; said Gobseck, &lsquo;after &lsquo;Change, at five o&rsquo;clock. Good,
      you will see me Wednesdays and Saturdays. We will talk over business like
      a pair of friends. Aha! I am gay sometimes. Just give me the wing of a
      partridge and a glass of champagne, and we will have our chat together. I
      know a great many things that can be told now at this distance of time; I
      will teach you to know men, and what is more&mdash;women!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! a partridge and a glass of champagne if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything foolish, or I shall lose my faith in you. And don&rsquo;t
      set up housekeeping in a grand way. Just one old general servant. I will
      come and see that you keep your health. I have capital invested in your
      head, he! he! so I am bound to look after you. There, come round in the
      evening and bring your principal with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind telling me, if there is no harm in asking, what was the
      good of my birth certificate in this business?&rsquo; I asked, when the little
      old man and I stood on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean-Esther Van Gobseck shrugged his shoulders, smiled maliciously, and
      said, &lsquo;What blockheads youngsters are! Learn, master attorney (for learn
      you must if you don&rsquo;t mean to be taken in), that integrity and brains in a
      man under thirty are commodities which can be mortgaged. After that age
      there is no counting on a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with that he shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months later I was an attorney. Before very long, madame, it was my
      good fortune to undertake the suit for the recovery of your estates. I won
      the day, and my name became known. In spite of the exorbitant rate of
      interest, I paid off Gobseck in less than five years. I married Fanny
      Malvaut, whom I loved with all my heart. There was a parallel between her
      life and mine, between our hard work and our luck, which increased the
      strength of feeling on either side. One of her uncles, a well-to-do
      farmer, died and left her seventy thousand francs, which helped to clear
      off the loan. From that day my life has been nothing but happiness and
      prosperity. Nothing is more utterly uninteresting than a happy man, so let
      us say no more on that head, and return to the rest of the characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a year after the purchase of the practice, I was dragged into a
      bachelor breakfast-party given by one of our number who had lost a bet to
      a young man greatly in vogue in the fashionable world. M. de Trailles, the
      flower of the dandyism of that day, enjoyed a prodigious reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is still enjoying it,&rdquo; put in the Comte de Born. &ldquo;No one wears his
      clothes with a finer air, nor drives a tandem with a better grace. It is
      Maxime&rsquo;s gift; he can gamble, eat, and drink more gracefully than any man
      in the world. He is a judge of horses, hats, and pictures. All the women
      lose their heads over him. He always spends something like a hundred
      thousand francs a year, and no creature can discover that he has an acre
      of land or a single dividend warrant. The typical knight errant of our
      salons, our boudoirs, our boulevards, an amphibian half-way between a man
      and a woman&mdash;Maxime de Trailles is a singular being, fit for
      anything, and good for nothing, quite as capable of perpetrating a benefit
      as of planning a crime; sometimes base, sometimes noble, more often
      bespattered with mire than besprinkled with blood, knowing more of anxiety
      than of remorse, more concerned with his digestion than with any mental
      process, shamming passion, feeling nothing. Maxime de Trailles is a
      brilliant link between the hulks and the best society; he belongs to the
      eminently intelligent class from which a Mirabeau, or a Pitt, or a
      Richelieu springs at times, though it is more wont to produce Counts of
      Horn, Fouquier-Tinvilles, and Coignards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; pursued Derville, when he had heard the Vicomtesse&rsquo;s brother to
      the end, &ldquo;I had heard a good deal about this individual from poor old
      Goriot, a client of mine; and I had already been at some pains to avoid
      the dangerous honor of his acquaintance, for I came across him sometimes
      in society. Still, my chum was so pressing about this breakfast-party of
      his that I could not well get out of it, unless I wished to earn a name
      for squeamishness. Madame, you could hardly imagine what a bachelor&rsquo;s
      breakfast-party is like. It means superb display and a studied refinement
      seldom seen; the luxury of a miser when vanity leads him to be sumptuous
      for a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised as you enter the room at the neatness of the table,
      dazzling by reason of its silver and crystal and linen damask. Life is
      here in full bloom; the young fellows are graceful to behold; they smile
      and talk in low, demure voices like so many brides; everything about them
      looks girlish. Two hours later you might take the room for a battlefield
      after the fight. Broken glasses, serviettes crumpled and torn to rags lie
      strewn about among the nauseous-looking remnants of food on the dishes.
      There is an uproar that stuns you, jesting toasts, a fire of witticisms
      and bad jokes; faces are empurpled, eyes inflamed and expressionless,
      unintentional confidences tell you the whole truth. Bottles are smashed,
      and songs trolled out in the height of a diabolical racket; men call each
      other out, hang on each other&rsquo;s necks, or fall to fisticuffs; the room is
      full of a horrid, close scent made up of a hundred odors, and noise enough
      for a hundred voices. No one has any notion of what he is eating or
      drinking or saying. Some are depressed, others babble, one will turn
      monomaniac, repeating the same word over and over again like a bell set
      jangling; another tries to keep the tumult within bounds; the steadiest
      will propose an orgy. If any one in possession of his faculties should
      come in, he would think that he had interrupted a Bacchanalian rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the thick of such a chaos that M. de Trailles tried to
      insinuate himself into my good graces. My head was fairly clear, I was
      upon my guard. As for him, though he pretended to be decently drunk, he
      was perfectly cool, and knew very well what he was about. How it was done
      I do not know, but the upshot of it was that when we left Grignon&rsquo;s rooms
      about nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, M. de Trailles had thoroughly bewitched
      me. I had given him my promise that I would introduce him the next day to
      our Papa Gobseck. The words &lsquo;honor,&rsquo; &lsquo;virtue,&rsquo; &lsquo;countess,&rsquo; &lsquo;honest woman,&rsquo; 
      and &lsquo;ill-luck&rsquo; were mingled in his discourse with magical potency, thanks
      to that golden tongue of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I awoke next morning, and tried to recollect what I had done the day
      before, it was with great difficulty that I could make a connected tale
      from my impressions. At last, it seemed to me that the daughter of one of
      my clients was in danger of losing her reputation, together with her
      husband&rsquo;s love and esteem, if she could not get fifty thousand francs
      together in the course of the morning. There had been gaming debts, and
      carriage-builders&rsquo; accounts, money lost to Heaven knows whom. My magician
      of a boon companion had impressed it upon me that she was rich enough to
      make good these reverses by a few years of economy. But only now did I
      begin to guess the reasons of his urgency. I confess, to my shame, that I
      had not the shadow of a doubt but that it was a matter of importance that
      Daddy Gobseck should make it up with this dandy. I was dressing when the
      young gentleman appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. le Comte,&rsquo; said I, after the usual greetings, &lsquo;I fail to see why you
      should need me to effect an introduction to Van Gobseck, the most civil
      and smooth-spoken of capitalists. Money will be forthcoming if he has any,
      or rather, if you can give him adequate security.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it does not enter into my thoughts to force you to
      do me a service, even though you have passed your word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sardanapalus!&rsquo; said I to myself, &lsquo;am I going to let that fellow imagine
      that I will not keep my word with him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I had the honor of telling you yesterday,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I had fallen
      out with Daddy Gobseck most inopportunely; and as there is scarcely
      another man in Paris who can come down on the nail with a hundred thousand
      francs, at the end of the month, I begged of you to make my peace with
      him. But let us say no more about it&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Trailles looked at me with civil insult in his expression, and made
      as if he would take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am ready to go with you,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we reached the Rue de Gres, my dandy looked about him with a
      circumspection and uneasiness that set me wondering. His face grew livid,
      flushed, and yellow, turn and turn about, and by the time that Gobseck&rsquo;s
      door came in sight the perspiration stood in drops on his forehead. We
      were just getting out of the cabriolet, when a hackney cab turned into the
      street. My companion&rsquo;s hawk eye detected a woman in the depths of the
      vehicle. His face lighted up with a gleam of almost savage joy; he called
      to a little boy who was passing, and gave him his horse to hold. Then we
      went up to the old bill discounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. Gobseck,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have brought one of my most intimate friends to
      see you (whom I trust as I would trust the Devil,&rsquo; I added for the old
      man&rsquo;s private ear). &lsquo;To oblige me you will do your best for him (at the
      ordinary rate), and pull him out of his difficulty (if it suits your
      convenience).&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Trailles made his bow to Gobseck, took a seat, and listened to us
      with a courtier-like attitude; its charming humility would have touched
      your heart to see, but my Gobseck sits in his chair by the fireside
      without moving a muscle, or changing a feature. He looked very like the
      statue of Voltaire under the peristyle of the Theatre-Francais, as you see
      it of an evening; he had partly risen as if to bow, and the skull cap that
      covered the top of his head, and the narrow strip of sallow forehead
      exhibited, completed his likeness to the man of marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have no money to spare except for my own clients,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So you are cross because I may have tried in other quarters to ruin
      myself?&rsquo; laughed the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ruin yourself!&rsquo; repeated Gobseck ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Were you about to remark that it is impossible to ruin a man who has
      nothing?&rsquo; inquired the dandy. &lsquo;Why, I defy you to find a better <i>stock</i>
      in Paris!&rsquo; he cried, swinging round on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This half-earnest buffoonery produced not the slightest effect upon
      Gobseck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Am I not on intimate terms with the Ronquerolles, the Marsays, the
      Franchessinis, the two Vandenesses, the Ajuda-Pintos,&mdash;all the most
      fashionable young men in Paris, in short? A prince and an ambassador (you
      know them both) are my partners at play. I draw my revenues from London
      and Carlsbad and Baden and Bath. Is not this the most brilliant of all
      industries!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;True.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You make a sponge of me, begad! you do. You encourage me to go and swell
      myself out in society, so that you can squeeze me when I am hard up; but
      you yourselves are sponges, just as I am, and death will give you a
      squeeze some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If there were no spendthrifts, what would become of you? The pair of us
      are like soul and body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, now, give us your hand, Grandaddy Gobseck, and be magnanimous if
      this is &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;precisely so.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You come to me,&rsquo; the usurer answered coldly, &lsquo;because Girard, Palma,
      Werbrust, and Gigonnet are full up of your paper; they are offering it at
      a loss of fifty per cent; and as it is likely they only gave you half the
      figure on the face of the bills, they are not worth five-and-twenty per
      cent of their supposed value. I am your most obedient! Can I in common
      decency lend a stiver to a man who owes thirty thousand francs, and has
      not one farthing?&rsquo; Gobseck continued. &lsquo;The day before yesterday you lost
      ten thousand francs at a ball at the Baron de Nucingen&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the Count, with rare impudence, &lsquo;my affairs are no concern of
      yours,&rsquo; and he looked the old man up and down. &lsquo;A man has no debts till
      payment is due.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;True.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My bills will be duly met.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And at this moment the question between you and me is simply whether the
      security I am going to offer is sufficient for the sum I have come to
      borrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cab stopped at the door, and the sound of wheels filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will bring something directly which perhaps will satisfy you,&rsquo; cried
      the young man, and he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! my son,&rsquo; exclaimed Gobseck, rising to his feet, and stretching out
      his arms to me, &lsquo;if he has good security, you have saved my life. It would
      be the death of me. Werbrust and Gigonnet imagined that they were going to
      play off a trick on me; and now, thanks to you, I shall have a good laugh
      at their expense to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something frightful about the old man&rsquo;s ecstasy. It was the one
      occasion when he opened his heart to me; and that flash of joy, swift
      though it was, will never be effaced from my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Favor me so far as to stay here,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;I am armed, and a sure
      shot. I have gone tiger-hunting, and fought on the deck when there was
      nothing for it but to win or die; but I don&rsquo;t care to trust yonder elegant
      scoundrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sat down again in his armchair before his bureau, and his face grew
      pale and impassive as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he continued, turning to me, &lsquo;you will see that lovely creature I
      once told you about; I can hear a fine lady&rsquo;s step in the corridor; it is
      she, no doubt;&rsquo; and, as a matter of fact, the young man came in with a
      woman on his arm. I recognized the Countess, whose levee Gobseck had
      described for me, one of old Goriot&rsquo;s two daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess did not see me at first; I stayed where I was in the window
      bay, with my face against the pane; but I saw her give Maxime a suspicious
      glance as she came into the money-lender&rsquo;s damp, dark room. So beautiful
      she was, that in spite of her faults I felt sorry for her. There was a
      terrible storm of anguish in her heart; her haughty, proud features were
      drawn and distorted with pain which she strove in vain to disguise. The
      young man had come to be her evil genius. I admired Gobseck, whose
      perspicacity had foreseen their future four years ago at the first bill
      which she endorsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Probably,&rsquo; said I to myself, &lsquo;this monster with the angel face controls
      every possible spring of action in her: rules her through vanity,
      jealousy, pleasure, and the current of life in the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomtesse de Grandlieu broke in on the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the woman&rsquo;s very virtues have been turned against her,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;He has made her shed tears of devotion, and then abused her
      kindness and made her pay very dearly for unhallowed bliss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Derville did not understand the signs which Mme. de Grandlieu made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I had no inclination to shed tears over the
      lot of this unhappy creature, so brilliant in society, so repulsive to
      eyes that could read her heart; I shuddered rather at the sight of her
      murderer, a young angel with such a clear brow, such red lips and white
      teeth, such a winning smile. There they stood before their judge, he
      scrutinizing them much as some fifteenth-century Dominican inquisitor
      might have peered into the dungeons of the Holy Office while the torture
      was administered to two Moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess spoke tremulously. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is there any way of
      obtaining the value of these diamonds, and of keeping the right of
      repurchase?&rsquo; She held out a jewel-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, madame,&rsquo; I put in, and came forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at me, and a shudder ran through her as she recognized me, and
      gave me the glance which means, &lsquo;Say nothing of this,&rsquo; all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;constitutes a sale with faculty of redemption, as it is
      called, a formal agreement to transfer and deliver over a piece of
      property, either real estate or personalty, for a given time, on the
      expiry of which the previous owner recovers his title to the property in
      question, upon payment of a stipulated sum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She breathed more freely. The Count looked black; he had grave doubts
      whether Gobseck would lend very much on the diamonds after such a fall in
      their value. Gobseck, impassive as ever, had taken up his magnifying
      glass, and was quietly scrutinizing the jewels. If I were to live for a
      hundred years, I should never forget the sight of his face at that moment.
      There was a flush in his pale cheeks; his eyes seemed to have caught the
      sparkle of the stones, for there was an unnatural glitter in them. He rose
      and went to the light, holding the diamonds close to his toothless mouth,
      as if he meant to devour them; mumbling vague words over them, holding up
      bracelets, sprays, necklaces, and tiaras one after another, to judge their
      water, whiteness, and cutting; taking them out of the jewel-case and
      putting them in again, letting the play of the light bring out all their
      fires. He was more like a child than an old man; or, rather, childhood and
      dotage seemed to meet in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fine stones! The set would have fetched three hundred thousand francs
      before the Revolution. What water! Genuine Asiatic diamonds from Golconda
      or Visapur. Do you know what they are worth? No, no; no one in Paris but
      Gobseck can appreciate them. In the time of the Empire such a set would
      have cost another two hundred thousand francs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave a disgusted shrug, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But now diamonds are going down in value every day. The Brazilians have
      swamped the market with them since the Peace; but the Indian stones are a
      better color. Others wear them now besides court ladies. Does madame go to
      court?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While he flung out these terrible words, he examined one stone after
      another with delight which no words can describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Flawless!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Here is a speck!... here is a flaw!... A fine stone
      that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His haggard face was so lighted up by the sparkling jewels, that it put
      me in mind of a dingy old mirror, such as you see in country inns. The
      glass receives every luminous image without reflecting the light, and a
      traveler bold enough to look for his face in it beholds a man in an
      apoplectic fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; asked the Count, clapping Gobseck on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old boy trembled. He put down his playthings on his bureau, took his
      seat, and was a money-lender once more&mdash;hard, cold, and polished as a
      marble column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How much do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;One hundred thousand francs for three years,&rsquo; said the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible,&rsquo; said Gobseck, and then from a mahogany box (Gobseck&rsquo;s
      jewel-case) he drew out a faultlessly adjusted pair of scales!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He weighed the diamonds, calculating the value of stones and setting at
      sight (Heaven knows how!), delight and severity struggling in the
      expression of his face the meanwhile. The Countess had plunged in a kind
      of stupor; to me, watching her, it seemed that she was fathoming the
      depths of the abyss into which she had fallen. There was remorse still
      left in that woman&rsquo;s soul. Perhaps a hand held out in human charity might
      save her. I would try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are the diamonds your personal property, madame?&rsquo; I asked in a clear
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, monsieur,&rsquo; she said, looking at me with proud eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Make out the deed of purchase with power of redemption, chatterbox,&rsquo; 
      said Gobseck to me, resigning his chair at the bureau in my favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Madame is without doubt a married woman?&rsquo; I tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She nodded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I will not draw up the deed,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; asked Gobseck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; echoed I, as I drew the old man into the bay window so as to
      speak aside with him. &lsquo;Why not? This woman is under her husband&rsquo;s control;
      the agreement would be void in law; you could not possibly assert your
      ignorance of a fact recorded on the very face of the document itself. You
      would be compelled at once to produce the diamonds deposited with you,
      according to the weight, value, and cutting therein described.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobseck cut me short with a nod, and turned towards the guilty couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He is right!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;That puts the whole thing in a different light.
      Eighty thousand francs down, and you leave the diamonds with me,&rsquo; he
      added, in the husky, flute-like voice. &lsquo;In the way of property, possession
      is as good as a title.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; objected the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You can take it or leave it,&rsquo; continued Gobseck, returning the
      jewel-case to the lady as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have too many risks to run.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It would be better to throw yourself at your husband&rsquo;s feet,&rsquo; I bent to
      whisper in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usurer doubtless knew what I was saying from the movement of my lips.
      He gave me a cool glance. The Count&rsquo;s face grew livid. The Countess was
      visibly wavering. Maxime stepped up to her, and, low as he spoke, I could
      catch the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Adieu, dear Anastasie, may you be happy! As for me, by to-morrow my
      troubles will be over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; cried the lady, turning to Gobseck. &lsquo;I accept your offer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, now,&rsquo; returned Gobseck. &lsquo;You have been a long time in coming to
      it, my fair lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote out a cheque for fifty thousand francs on the Bank of France,
      and handed it to the Countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; continued he with a smile, such a smile as you will see in
      portraits of M. Voltaire, &lsquo;now I will give you the rest of the amount in
      bills, thirty thousand francs&rsquo; worth of paper as good as bullion. This
      gentleman here has just said, &ldquo;My bills will be met when they are due,&rdquo;&rsquo; 
      added he, producing certain drafts bearing the Count&rsquo;s signature, all
      protested the day before at the request of some of the confraternity, who
      had probably made them over to him (Gobseck) at a considerably reduced
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man growled out something, in which the words &lsquo;Old scoundrel!&rsquo; 
      were audible. Daddy Gobseck did not move an eyebrow. He drew a pair of
      pistols out of a pigeon-hole, remarking coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As the insulted man, I fire first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Maxime, you owe this gentleman an explanation,&rsquo; cried the trembling
      Countess in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I had no intention of giving offence,&rsquo; stammered Maxime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am quite sure of that,&rsquo; Gobseck answered calmly; &lsquo;you had no intention
      of meeting your bills, that was all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess rose, bowed, and vanished, with a great dread gnawing her, I
      doubt not. M. de Trailles was bound to follow, but before he went he
      managed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If either of you gentlemen should forget himself, I will have his blood,
      or he will have mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; called Daddy Gobseck as he put his pistols back in their place;
      &lsquo;but a man must have blood in his veins though before he can risk it, my
      son, and you have nothing but mud in yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the door was closed, and the two vehicles had gone, Gobseck rose to
      his feet and began to prance about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have the diamonds! I have the diamonds!&rsquo; he cried again and again,
      &lsquo;the beautiful diamonds! such diamonds! and tolerably cheaply. Aha! aha!
      Werbrust and Gigonnet, you thought you had old Papa Gobseck! <i>Ego sum
      papa</i>! I am master of the lot of you! Paid! paid, principal and
      interest! How silly they will look to-night when I shall come out with
      this story between two games of dominoes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dark glee, the savage ferocity aroused by the possession of a few
      water-white pebbles, set me shuddering. I was dumb with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aha! There you are, my boy!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;We will dine together. We will
      have some fun at your place, for I haven&rsquo;t a home of my own, and these
      restaurants, with their broths, and sauces, and wines, would poison the
      Devil himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in my face suddenly brought back the usual cold, impassive
      expression to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand it,&rsquo; he said, and sitting down by the hearth, he
      put a tin saucepan full of milk on the brazier.&mdash;&lsquo;Will you breakfast
      with me?&rsquo; continued he. &lsquo;Perhaps there will be enough here for two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I do not breakfast till noon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had scarcely spoken before hurried footsteps sounded from the passage.
      The stranger stopped at Gobseck&rsquo;s door and rapped; there was that in the
      knock which suggested a man transported with rage. Gobseck reconnoitred
      him through the grating; then he opened the door, and in came a man of
      thirty-five or so, judged harmless apparently in spite of his anger. The
      newcomer, who was quite plainly dressed, bore a strong resemblance to the
      late Duc de Richelieu. You must often have met him, he was the Countess&rsquo; 
      husband, a man with the aristocratic figure (permit the expression to
      pass) peculiar to statesmen of your faubourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said this person, addressing himself to Gobseck, who had quite
      recovered his tranquillity, &lsquo;did my wife go out of this house just now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir? do you not take my meaning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have not the honor of the acquaintance of my lady your wife,&rsquo; returned
      Gobseck. &lsquo;I have had a good many visitors this morning, women and men, and
      mannish young ladies, and young gentlemen who look like young ladies. I
      should find it very hard to say&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A truce to jesting, sir! I mean the woman who has this moment gone out
      from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How can I know whether she is your wife or not? I never had the pleasure
      of seeing you before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are mistaken, M. Gobseck,&rsquo; said the Count, with profound irony in
      his voice. &lsquo;We have met before, one morning in my wife&rsquo;s bedroom. You had
      come to demand payment for a bill&mdash;no bill of hers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was no business of mine to inquire what value she had received for
      it,&rsquo; said Gobseck, with a malignant look at the Count. &lsquo;I had come by the
      bill in the way of business. At the same time, monsieur,&rsquo; continued
      Gobseck, quietly pouring coffee into his bowl of milk, without a trace of
      excitement or hurry in his voice, &lsquo;you will permit me to observe that your
      right to enter my house and expostulate with me is far from proven to my
      mind. I came of age in the sixty-first year of the preceding century.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the Count, &lsquo;you have just bought family diamonds, which do
      not belong to my wife, for a mere trifle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Without feeling it incumbent upon me to tell you my private affairs, I
      will tell you this much M. le Comte&mdash;if Mme. la Comtesse has taken
      your diamonds, you should have sent a circular around to all the jewelers,
      giving them notice not to buy them; she might have sold them separately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You know my wife, sir!&rsquo; roared the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;True.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She is in her husband&rsquo;s power.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She had no right to dispose of those diamonds&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, sir. I knew your wife, and she is in her husband&rsquo;s power; I
      am quite willing, she is in the power of a good many people; but&mdash;I&mdash;do&mdash;<i>not</i>&mdash;know&mdash;your
      diamonds. If Mme. la Comtesse can put her name to a bill, she can go into
      business, of course, and buy and sell diamonds on her own account. The
      thing is plain on the face of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-day, sir!&rsquo; cried the Count, now white with rage. &lsquo;There are courts
      of justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quite so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This gentleman here,&rsquo; he added, indicating me, &lsquo;was a witness of the
      sale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count turned to go. Feeling the gravity of the affair, I suddenly put
      in between the two belligerents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. le Comte,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are right, and M. Gobseck is by no means in
      the wrong. You could not prosecute the purchaser without bringing your
      wife into court, and the whole of the odium would not fall on her. I am an
      attorney, and I owe it to myself, and still more to my professional
      position, to declare that the diamonds of which you speak were purchased
      by M. Gobseck in my presence; but, in my opinion, it would be unwise to
      dispute the legality of the sale, especially as the goods are not readily
      recognizable. In equity our contention would lie, in law it would
      collapse. M. Gobseck is too honest a man to deny that the sale was a
      profitable transaction, more especially as my conscience, no less than my
      duty, compels me to make the admission. But once bring the case into a
      court of law, M. le Comte, the issue would be doubtful. My advice to you
      is to come to terms with M. Gobseck, who can plead that he bought the
      diamonds in all good faith; you would be bound in any case to return the
      purchase money. Consent to an arrangement, with power to redeem at the end
      of seven or eight months, or a year even, or any convenient lapse of time,
      for the repayment of the sum borrowed by Mme. la Comtesse, unless you
      would prefer to repurchase them outright and give security for repayment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobseck dipped his bread into the bowl of coffee, and ate with perfect
      indifference; but at the words &lsquo;come to terms,&rsquo; he looked at me as who
      should say, &lsquo;A fine fellow that! he has learned something from my
      lessons!&rsquo; And I, for my part, riposted with a glance, which he understood
      uncommonly well. The business was dubious and shady; there was pressing
      need of coming to terms. Gobseck could not deny all knowledge of it, for I
      should appear as a witness. The Count thanked me with a smile of
      good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the debate which followed, Gobseck showed greed enough and skill
      enough to baffle a whole congress of diplomatists; but in the end I drew
      up an instrument, in which the Count acknowledged the receipt of
      eighty-five thousand francs, interest included, in consideration of which
      Gobseck undertook to return the diamonds to the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What waste!&rsquo; exclaimed he as he put his signature to the agreement. &lsquo;How
      is it possible to bridge such a gulf?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you many children, sir?&rsquo; Gobseck asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count winced at the question; it was as if the old money-lender, like
      an experienced physician, had put his finger at once on the sore spot. The
      Comtesse&rsquo;s husband did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Gobseck, taking the pained silence for answer, &lsquo;I know your
      story by heart. The woman is a fiend, but perhaps you love her still; I
      can well believe it; she made an impression on me. Perhaps, too, you would
      rather save your fortune, and keep it for one or two of your children?
      Well, fling yourself into the whirlpool of society, lose that fortune at
      play, come to Gobseck pretty often. The world will say that I am a Jew, a
      Tartar, a usurer, a pirate, will say that I have ruined you! I snap my
      fingers at them! If anybody insults me, I lay my man out; nobody is a
      surer shot nor handles a rapier better than your servant. And every one
      knows it. Then, have a friend&mdash;if you can find one&mdash;and make
      over your property to him by a fictitious sale. You call that a <i>fidei
      commissum</i>, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; he asked, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count seemed to be entirely absorbed in his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall have your money to-morrow,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;have the diamonds in
      readiness,&rsquo; and he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There goes one who looks to me to be as stupid as an honest man,&rsquo; 
      Gobseck said coolly when the Count had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Say rather stupid as a man of passionate nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Count owes you your fee for drawing up the agreement!&rsquo; Gobseck
      called after me as I took my leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One morning, a few days after the scene which initiated me into the
      terrible depths beneath the surface of the life of a woman of fashion, the
      Count came into my private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have come to consult you on a matter of grave moment,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I
      begin by telling you that I have perfect confidence in you, as I hope to
      prove to you. Your behavior to Mme. de Grandlieu is above all praise,&rsquo; the
      Count went on. (You see, madame, that you have paid me a thousand times
      over for a very simple matter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bowed respectfully, and replied that I had done nothing but the duty of
      an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; the Count went on, &lsquo;I have made a great many inquiries about the
      singular personage to whom you owe your position. And from all that I can
      learn, Gobseck is a philosopher of the Cynic school. What do you think of
      his probity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M. le Comte,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;Gobseck is my benefactor&mdash;at fifteen per
      cent,&rsquo; I added, laughing. &lsquo;But his avarice does not authorize me to paint
      him to the life for a stranger&rsquo;s benefit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Speak out, sir. Your frankness cannot injure Gobseck or yourself. I do
      not expect to find an angel in a pawnbroker.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Daddy Gobseck,&rsquo; I began, &lsquo;is intimately convinced of the truth of the
      principle which he takes for a rule of life. In his opinion, money is a
      commodity which you may sell cheap or dear, according to circumstances,
      with a clear conscience. A capitalist, by charging a high rate of
      interest, becomes in his eyes a secured partner by anticipation. Apart
      from the peculiar philosophical views of human nature and financial
      principles, which enable him to behave like a usurer, I am fully persuaded
      that, out of his business, he is the most loyal and upright soul in Paris.
      There are two men in him; he is petty and great&mdash;a miser and a
      philosopher. If I were to die and leave a family behind me, he would be
      the guardian whom I should appoint. This was how I came to see Gobseck in
      this light, monsieur. I know nothing of his past life. He may have been a
      pirate, may, for anything I know, have been all over the world,
      trafficking in diamonds, or men, or women, or State secrets; but this I
      affirm of him&mdash;never has human soul been more thoroughly tempered and
      tried. When I paid off my loan, I asked him, with a little circumlocution
      of course, how it was that he had made me pay such an exorbitant rate of
      interest; and why, seeing that I was a friend, and he meant to do me a
      kindness, he should not have yielded to the wish and made it complete.&mdash;&ldquo;My
      son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I released you from all need to feel any gratitude by
      giving you ground for the belief that you owed me nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;So we
      are the best friends in the world. That answer, monsieur, gives you the
      man better than any amount of description.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have made up my mind once and for all,&rsquo; said the Count. &lsquo;Draw up the
      necessary papers; I am going to transfer my property to Gobseck. I have no
      one but you to trust to in the draft of the counter-deed, which will
      declare that this transfer is a simulated sale, and that Gobseck as
      trustee will administer my estate (as he knows how to administer), and
      undertakes to make over my fortune to my eldest son when he comes of age.
      Now, sir, this I must tell you: I should be afraid to have that precious
      document in my own keeping. My boy is so fond of his mother, that I cannot
      trust him with it. So dare I beg of you to keep it for me? In case of
      death, Gobseck would make you legatee of my property. Every contingency is
      provided for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count paused for a moment. He seemed greatly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A thousand pardons,&rsquo; he said at length; &lsquo;I am in great pain, and have
      very grave misgivings as to my health. Recent troubles have disturbed me
      very painfully, and forced me to take this great step.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Allow me first to thank you, monsieur,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for the trust you place
      me in. But I am bound to deserve it by pointing out to you that you are
      disinheriting your&mdash;other children. They bear your name. Merely as
      the children of a once-loved wife, now fallen from her position, they have
      a claim to an assured existence. I tell you plainly that I cannot accept
      the trust with which you propose to honor me unless their future is
      secured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count trembled violently at the words, and tears came into his eyes
      as he grasped my hand, saying, &lsquo;I did not know my man thoroughly. You have
      made me both glad and sorry. We will make provision for the children in
      the counter-deed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went with him to the door; it seemed to me that there was a glow of
      satisfaction in his face at the thought of this act of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Camille, this is how a young wife takes the first step to the brink
      of a precipice. A quadrille, a ballad, a picnic party is sometimes cause
      sufficient of frightful evils. You are hurried on by the presumptuous
      voice of vanity and pride, on the faith of a smile, or through giddiness
      and folly! Shame and misery and remorse are three Furies awaiting every
      woman the moment she oversteps the limits&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Camille can hardly keep awake,&rdquo; the Vicomtesse hastily broke in.&mdash;&ldquo;Go
      to bed, child; you have no need of appalling pictures to keep you pure in
      heart and conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camille de Grandlieu took the hint and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going rather too far, dear M. Derville,&rdquo; said the Vicomtesse,
      &ldquo;an attorney is not a mother of daughters nor yet a preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But any newspaper is a thousand times&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Derville!&rdquo; exclaimed the Vicomtesse, &ldquo;what has come over you? Do you
      really imagine that I allow a daughter of mine to read the newspapers?&mdash;Go
      on,&rdquo; she added after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months after everything was signed and sealed between the Count and
      Gobseck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call him the Comte de Restaud, now that Camille is not here,&rdquo;
       said the Vicomtesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it! Well, time went by, and I saw nothing of the counter-deed,
      which by rights should have been in my hands. An attorney in Paris lives
      in such a whirl of business that with certain exceptions which we make for
      ourselves, we have not the time to give each individual client the amount
      of interest which he himself takes in his affairs. Still, one day when
      Gobseck came to dine with me, I asked him as we left the table if he knew
      how it was that I had heard no more of M. de Restaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are excellent reasons for that,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the noble Count is at
      death&rsquo;s door. He is one of the soft stamp that cannot learn how to put an
      end to chagrin, and allow it to wear them out instead. Life is a craft, a
      profession; every man must take the trouble to learn that business. When
      he has learned what life is by dint of painful experiences, the fibre of
      him is toughened, and acquires a certain elasticity, so that he has his
      sensibilities under his own control; he disciplines himself till his
      nerves are like steel springs, which always bend, but never break; given a
      sound digestion, and a man in such training ought to live as long as the
      cedars of Lebanon, and famous trees they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then is the Count actually dying?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible,&rsquo; said Gobseck; &lsquo;the winding up of his estate will be a
      juicy bit of business for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked at my man, and said, by way of sounding him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Just explain to me how it is that we, the Count and I, are the only men
      in whom you take an interest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Because you are the only two who have trusted me without finessing,&rsquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although this answer warranted my belief that Gobseck would act fairly
      even if the counter-deed were lost, I resolved to go to see the Count. I
      pleaded a business engagement, and we separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went straight to the Rue du Helder, and was shown into a room where the
      Countess sat playing with her children. When she heard my name, she sprang
      up and came to meet me, then she sat down and pointed without a word to a
      chair by the fire. Her face wore the inscrutable mask beneath which women
      of the world conceal their most vehement emotions. Trouble had withered
      that face already. Nothing of its beauty now remained, save the marvelous
      outlines in which its principal charm had lain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is essential, madame, that I should speak to M. le Comte&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If so, you would be more favored than I am,&rsquo; she said, interrupting me.
      &lsquo;M. de Restaud will see no one. He will hardly allow his doctor to come,
      and will not be nursed even by me. When people are ill, they have such
      strange fancies! They are like children, they do not know what they want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps, like children, they know very well what they want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess reddened. I almost repented a thrust worthy of Gobseck. So,
      by way of changing the conversation, I added, &lsquo;But M. de Restaud cannot
      possibly lie there alone all day, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His oldest boy is with him,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was useless to gaze at the Countess; she did not blush this time, and
      it looked to me as if she were resolved more firmly than ever that I
      should not penetrate into her secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You must understand, madame, that my proceeding is no way indiscreet. It
      is strongly to his interest&mdash;&rsquo; I bit my lips, feeling that I had gone
      the wrong way to work. The Countess immediately took advantage of my slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My interests are in no way separate from my husband&rsquo;s, sir,&rsquo; said she.
      &lsquo;There is nothing to prevent your addressing yourself to me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The business which brings me here concerns no one but M. le Comte,&rsquo; I
      said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will let him know of your wish to see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The civil tone and expression assumed for the occasion did not impose
      upon me; I divined that she would never allow me to see her husband. I
      chatted on about indifferent matters for a little while, so as to study
      her; but, like all women who have once begun to plot for themselves, she
      could dissimulate with the rare perfection which, in your sex, means the
      last degree of perfidy. If I may dare to say it, I looked for anything
      from her, even a crime. She produced this feeling in me, because it was so
      evident from her manner and in all that she did or said, down to the very
      inflections of her voice, that she had an eye to the future. I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I will pass on to the final scenes of this adventure, throwing in a
      few circumstances brought to light by time, and some details guessed by
      Gobseck&rsquo;s perspicacity or by my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the Comte de Restaud apparently plunged into the vortex of
      dissipation, something passed between the husband and wife, something
      which remains an impenetrable secret, but the wife sank even lower in the
      husband&rsquo;s eyes. As soon as he became so ill that he was obliged to take to
      his bed, he manifested his aversion for the Countess and the two youngest
      children. He forbade them to enter his room, and any attempt to disobey
      his wishes brought on such dangerous attacks that the doctor implored the
      Countess to submit to her husband&rsquo;s wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. de Restaud had seen the family estates and property, nay, the very
      mansion in which she lived, pass into the hands of Gobseck, who appeared
      to play the fantastic ogre so far as their wealth was concerned. She
      partially understood what her husband was doing, no doubt. M. de Trailles
      was traveling in England (his creditors had been a little too pressing of
      late), and no one else was in a position to enlighten the lady, and
      explain that her husband was taking precautions against her at Gobseck&rsquo;s
      suggestion. It is said that she held out for a long while before she gave
      the signature required by French law for the sale of the property;
      nevertheless the Count gained his point. The Countess was convinced that
      her husband was realizing his fortune, and that somewhere or other there
      would be a little bunch of notes representing the amount; they had been
      deposited with a notary, or perhaps at the bank, or in some safe
      hiding-place. Following out her train of thought, it was evident that M.
      de Restaud must of necessity have some kind of document in his possession
      by which any remaining property could be recovered and handed over to his
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she made up her mind to keep the strictest possible watch over the
      sick-room. She ruled despotically in the house, and everything in it was
      submitted to this feminine espionage. All day she sat in the salon
      adjoining her husband&rsquo;s room, so that she could hear every syllable that
      he uttered, every least movement that he made. She had a bed put there for
      her of a night, but she did not sleep very much. The doctor was entirely
      in her interests. Such wifely devotion seemed praiseworthy enough. With
      the natural subtlety of perfidy, she took care to disguise M. de Restaud&rsquo;s
      repugnance for her, and feigned distress so perfectly that she gained a
      sort of celebrity. Strait-laced women were even found to say that she had
      expiated her sins. Always before her eyes she beheld a vision of the
      destitution to follow on the Count&rsquo;s death if her presence of mind should
      fail her; and in these ways the wife, repulsed from the bed of pain on
      which her husband lay and groaned, had drawn a charmed circle round about
      it. So near, yet kept at a distance; all-powerful, but in disgrace, the
      apparently devoted wife was lying in wait for death and opportunity;
      crouching like the ant-lion at the bottom of his spiral pit, ever on the
      watch for the prey that cannot escape, listening to the fall of every
      grain of sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strictest censor could not but recognize that the Countess pushed
      maternal sentiment to the last degree. Her father&rsquo;s death had been a
      lesson to her, people said. She worshiped her children. They were so young
      that she could hide the disorders of her life from their eyes, and could
      win their love; she had given them the best and most brilliant education.
      I confess that I cannot help admiring her and feeling sorry for her.
      Gobseck used to joke me about it. Just about that time she had discovered
      Maxime&rsquo;s baseness, and was expiating the sins of the past in tears of
      blood. I was sure of it. Hateful as were the measures which she took for
      regaining control of her husband&rsquo;s money, were they not the result of a
      mother&rsquo;s love, and a desire to repair the wrongs she had done her
      children? And again, it may be, like many a woman who has experienced the
      storm of lawless love, she felt a longing to lead a virtuous life again.
      Perhaps she only learned the worth of that life when she came to reap the
      woeful harvest sown by her errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every time that little Ernest came out of his father&rsquo;s room, she put him
      through a searching examination as to all that his father had done or
      said. The boy willingly complied with his mother&rsquo;s wishes, and told her
      even more than she asked in her anxious affection, as he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My visit was a ray of light for the Countess. She was determined to see
      in me the instrument of the Count&rsquo;s vengeance, and resolved that I should
      not be allowed to go near the dying man. I augured ill of all this, and
      earnestly wished for an interview, for I was not easy in my mind about the
      fate of the counter-deed. If it should fall into the Countess&rsquo; hands, she
      might turn it to her own account, and that would be the beginning of a
      series of interminable lawsuits between her and Gobseck. I knew the usurer
      well enough to feel convinced that he would never give up the property to
      her; there was room for plenty of legal quibbling over a series of
      transfers, and I alone knew all the ins and outs of the matter. I was
      minded to prevent such a tissue of misfortune, so I went to the Countess a
      second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed, madame,&rdquo; said Derville, turning to the Vicomtesse, and
      speaking in a confidential tone, &ldquo;certain moral phenomena to which we do
      not pay enough attention. I am naturally an observer of human nature, and
      instinctively I bring a spirit of analysis to the business that I transact
      in the interest of others, when human passions are called into lively
      play. Now, I have often noticed, and always with new wonder, that two
      antagonists almost always divine each other&rsquo;s inmost thoughts and ideas.
      Two enemies sometimes possess a power of clear insight into mental
      processes, and read each other&rsquo;s minds as two lovers read in either soul.
      So when we came together, the Countess and I, I understood at once the
      reason of her antipathy for me, disguised though it was by the most
      gracious forms of politeness and civility. I had been forced to be her
      confidant, and a woman cannot but hate the man before whom she is
      compelled to blush. And she on her side knew that if I was the man in whom
      her husband placed confidence, that husband had not as yet given up his
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare you the conversation, but it abides in my memory as one of
      the most dangerous encounters in my career. Nature had bestowed on her all
      the qualities which, combined, are irresistibly fascinating; she could be
      pliant and proud by turns, and confiding and coaxing in her manner; she
      even went so far as to try to subjugate me. It was a failure. As I took my
      leave of her, I caught a gleam of hate and rage in her eyes that made me
      shudder. We parted enemies. She would fain have crushed me out of
      existence; and for my own part, I felt pity for her, and for some natures
      pity is the deadliest of insults. This feeling pervaded the last
      representations I put before her; and when I left her, I left, I think,
      dread in the depths of her soul, by declaring that, turn which way she
      would, ruin lay inevitably before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I were to see M. le Comte, your children&rsquo;s property at any rate would&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I should be at your mercy,&rsquo; she said, breaking in upon me, disgust in
      her gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we had spoken frankly, I made up my mind to save the family from
      impending destitution. I resolved to strain the law at need to gain my
      ends, and this was what I did. I sued the Comte de Restaud for a sum of
      money, ostensibly due to Gobseck, and gained judgment. The Countess, of
      course, did not allow him to know of this, but I had gained on my point, I
      had a right to affix seals to everything on the death of the Count. I
      bribed one of the servants in the house&mdash;the man undertook to let me
      know at any hour of the day or night if his master should be at the point
      of death, so that I could intervene at once, scare the Countess with a
      threat of affixing seals, and so secure the counter-deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learned later on that the woman was studying the Code, with her
      husband&rsquo;s dying moans in her ears. If we could picture the thoughts of
      those who stand about a deathbed, what fearful sights should we not see?
      Money is always the motive-spring of the schemes elaborated, of all the
      plans that are made and the plots that are woven about it! Let us leave
      these details, nauseating in the nature of them; but perhaps they may have
      given you some insight into all that this husband and wife endured;
      perhaps too they may unveil much that is passing in secret in other
      houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two months the Comte de Restaud lay on his bed, alone, and resigned
      to his fate. Mortal disease was slowly sapping the strength of mind and
      body. Unaccountable and grotesque sick fancies preyed upon him; he would
      not suffer them to set his room in order, no one could nurse him, he would
      not even allow them to make his bed. All his surroundings bore the marks
      of this last degree of apathy, the furniture was out of place, the
      daintiest trifles were covered with dust and cobwebs. In health he had
      been a man of refined and expensive tastes, now he positively delighted in
      the comfortless look of the room. A host of objects required in illness&mdash;rows
      of medicine bottles, empty and full, most of them dirty, crumpled linen,
      and broken plates, littered the writing-table, chairs, and chimney-piece.
      An open warming-pan lay on the floor before the grate; a bath, still full
      of mineral water had not been taken away. The sense of coming dissolution
      pervaded all the details of an unsightly chaos. Signs of death appeared in
      things inanimate before the Destroyer came to the body on the bed. The
      Comte de Restaud could not bear the daylight, the Venetian shutters were
      closed, darkness deepened the gloom in the dismal chamber. The sick man himself
      had wasted greatly. All the life in him seemed to have taken refuge in the
      still brilliant eyes. The livid whiteness of his face was something
      horrible to see, enhanced as it was by the long dank locks of hair that
      straggled along his cheeks, for he would never suffer them to cut it. He
      looked like some religious fanatic in the desert. Mental suffering was
      extinguishing all human instincts in this man of scarce fifty years of
      age, whom all Paris had known as so brilliant and so successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One morning at the beginning of December 1824, he looked up at Ernest,
      who sat at the foot of his bed gazing at his father with wistful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you in pain?&rsquo; the little Vicomte asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Count, with a ghastly smile, &lsquo;it all lies <i>here and
      about my heart</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pointed to his forehead, and then laid his wasted fingers on his
      hollow chest. Ernest began to cry at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How is it that M. Derville does not come to me?&rsquo; the Count asked his
      servant (he thought that Maurice was really attached to him, but the man
      was entirely in the Countess&rsquo; interest)&mdash;&lsquo;What! Maurice!&rsquo; and the
      dying man suddenly sat upright in his bed, and seemed to recover all his
      presence of mind, &lsquo;I have sent for my attorney seven or eight times during
      the last fortnight, and he does not come!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Do you imagine that
      I am to be trifled with? Go for him, at once, this very instant, and bring
      him back with you. If you do not carry out my orders, I shall get up and
      go myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said the man as he came into the salon, &lsquo;you heard M. le Comte;
      what ought I to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pretend to go to the attorney, and when you come back tell your master
      that his man of business is forty leagues away from Paris on an important
      lawsuit. Say that he is expected back at the end of the week.&mdash;Sick
      people never know how ill they are,&rsquo; thought the Countess; &lsquo;he will wait
      till the man comes home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor had said on the previous evening that the Count could scarcely
      live through the day. When the servant came back two hours later to give
      that hopeless answer, the dying man seemed to be greatly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh God!&rsquo; he cried again and again, &lsquo;I put my trust in none but Thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a long while he lay and gazed at his son, and spoke in a feeble voice
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ernest, my boy, you are very young; but you have a good heart; you can
      understand, no doubt, that a promise given to a dying man is sacred; a
      promise to a father... Do you feel that you can be trusted with a secret,
      and keep it so well and so closely that even your mother herself shall not
      know that you have a secret to keep? There is no one else in this house
      whom I can trust to-day. You will not betray my trust, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, then, Ernest, in a minute or two I will give you a sealed
      packet that belongs to M. Derville; you must take such care of it that no
      one can know that you have it; then you must slip out of the house and put
      the letter into the post-box at the corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can I depend upon you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come and kiss me. You have made death less bitter to me, dear boy. In
      six or seven years&rsquo; time you will understand the importance of this
      secret, and you will be well rewarded then for your quickness and
      obedience, you will know then how much I love you. Leave me alone for a
      minute, and let no one&mdash;no matter whom&mdash;come in meanwhile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ernest went out and saw his mother standing in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ernest,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sat down, drew her son to her knees, and clasped him in her arms, and
      held him tightly to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ernest, your father said something to you just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot repeat it, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, my dear child!&rsquo; cried the Countess, kissing him in rapture. &lsquo;You
      have kept your secret; how glad that makes me! Never tell a lie; never
      fail to keep your word&mdash;those are two principles which should never
      be forgotten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! mamma, how beautiful you are! <i>You</i> have never told a lie, I am
      quite sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Once or twice, Ernest dear, I have lied. Yes, and I have not kept my
      word under circumstances which speak louder than all precepts. Listen, my
      Ernest, you are big enough and intelligent enough to see that your father
      drives me away, and will not allow me to nurse him, and this is not
      natural, for you know how much I love him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, mamma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess began to cry. &lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;this misfortune is
      the result of treacherous insinuations. Wicked people have tried to
      separate me from your father to satisfy their greed. They mean to take all
      our money from us and to keep it for themselves. If your father were well,
      the division between us would soon be over; he would listen to me; he is
      loving and kind; he would see his mistake. But now his mind is affected,
      and his prejudices against me have become a fixed idea, a sort of mania
      with him. It is one result of his illness. Your father&rsquo;s fondness for you
      is another proof that his mind is deranged. Until he fell ill you never
      noticed that he loved you more than Pauline and Georges. It is all caprice
      with him now. In his affection for you he might take it into his head to
      tell you to do things for him. If you do not want to ruin us all, my
      darling, and to see your mother begging her bread like a pauper woman, you
      must tell her everything&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried the Count. He had opened the door and stood there, a sudden,
      half-naked apparition, almost as thin and fleshless as a skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His smothered cry produced a terrible effect upon the Countess; she sat
      motionless, as if a sudden stupor had seized her. Her husband was as white
      and wasted as if he had risen out of his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You have filled my life to the full with trouble, and now you are trying
      to vex my deathbed, to warp my boy&rsquo;s mind, and make a depraved man of
      him!&rsquo; he cried, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess flung herself at his feet. His face, working with the last
      emotions of life, was almost hideous to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mercy! mercy!&rsquo; she cried aloud, shedding a torrent of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you shown me any pity?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;I allowed you to squander your
      own money, and now do you mean to squander my fortune, too, and ruin my
      son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! well, yes, have no pity for me, be merciless to me!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;But
      the children? Condemn your widow to live in a convent; I will obey you; I
      will do anything, anything that you bid me, to expiate the wrong I have
      done you, if that so the children may be happy! The children! Oh, the
      children!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have only one child,&rsquo; said the Count, stretching out a wasted arm, in
      his despair, towards his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon a penitent woman, a penitent woman!...&rsquo; wailed the Countess, her
      arms about her husband&rsquo;s damp feet. She could not speak for sobbing;
      vague, incoherent sounds broke from her parched throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You dare to talk of penitence after all that you said to Ernest!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed the dying man, shaking off the Countess, who lay groveling over
      his feet.&mdash;&lsquo;You turn me to ice!&rsquo; he added, and there was something
      appalling in the indifference with which he uttered the words. &lsquo;You have
      been a bad daughter; you have been a bad wife; you will be a bad mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretched woman fainted away. The dying man reached his bed and lay
      down again, and a few hours later sank into unconsciousness. The priests
      came and administered the sacraments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At midnight he died; the scene that morning had exhausted his remaining
      strength, and on the stroke of midnight I arrived with Daddy Gobseck. The
      house was in confusion, and under cover of it we walked up into the little
      salon adjoining the death-chamber. The three children were there in tears,
      with two priests, who had come to watch with the dead. Ernest came over to
      me, and said that his mother desired to be alone in the Count&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do not go in,&rsquo; he said; and I admired the child for his tone and
      gesture; &lsquo;she is praying there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobseck began to laugh that soundless laugh of his, but I felt too much
      touched by the feeling in Ernest&rsquo;s little face to join in the miser&rsquo;s
      sardonic amusement. When Ernest saw that we moved towards the door, he
      planted himself in front of it, crying out, &lsquo;Mamma, here are some
      gentlemen in black who want to see you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobseck lifted Ernest out of the way as if the child had been a feather,
      and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a scene it was that met our eyes! The room was in frightful
      disorder; clothes and papers and rags lay tossed about in a confusion
      horrible to see in the presence of Death; and there, in the midst, stood
      the Countess in disheveled despair, unable to utter a word, her eyes
      glittering. The Count had scarcely breathed his last before his wife came
      in and forced open the drawers and the desk; the carpet was strewn with
      litter, some of the furniture and boxes were broken, the signs of violence
      could be seen everywhere. But if her search had at first proved fruitless,
      there was that in her excitement and attitude which led me to believe that
      she had found the mysterious documents at last. I glanced at the bed, and
      professional instinct told me all that had happened. The mattress had been
      flung contemptuously down by the bedside, and across it, face downwards,
      lay the body of the Count, like one of the paper envelopes that strewed
      the carpet&mdash;he too was nothing now but an envelope. There was
      something grotesquely horrible in the attitude of the stiffening rigid
      limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dying man must have hidden the counter-deed under his pillow to keep
      it safe so long as life should last; and his wife must have guessed his
      thought; indeed, it might be read plainly in his last dying gesture, in
      the convulsive clutch of his claw-like hands. The pillow had been flung to
      the floor at the foot of the bed; I could see the print of her heel upon
      it. At her feet lay a paper with the Count&rsquo;s arms on the seals; I snatched
      it up, and saw that it was addressed to me. I looked steadily at the
      Countess with the pitiless clear-sightedness of an examining magistrate
      confronting a guilty creature. The contents were blazing in the grate; she
      had flung them on the fire at the sound of our approach, imagining, from a
      first hasty glance at the provisions which I had suggested for her
      children, that she was destroying a will which disinherited them. A
      tormented conscience and involuntary horror of the deed which she had done
      had taken away all power of reflection. She had been caught in the act,
      and possibly the scaffold was rising before her eyes, and she already felt
      the felon&rsquo;s branding iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she stood gasping for breath, waiting for us to speak, staring at
      us with haggard eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went across to the grate and pulled out an unburned fragment. &lsquo;Ah,
      madame!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;you have ruined your children! Those papers were
      their titles to their property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mouth twitched, she looked as if she were threatened by a paralytic
      seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Eh! eh!&rsquo; cried Gobseck; the harsh, shrill tone grated upon our ears like
      the sound of a brass candlestick scratching a marble surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a pause, then the old man turned to me and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you intend Mme. la Comtesse to suppose that I am not the rightful
      owner of the property sold to me by her late husband? This house belongs
      to me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden blow on the head from a bludgeon would have given me less pain
      and astonishment. The Countess saw the look of hesitation in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;Monsieur!&rsquo; She could find no other words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are a trustee, are you not?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then do you mean to take advantage of this crime of hers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went at that, leaving the Countess sitting by her husband&rsquo;s bedside,
      shedding hot tears. Gobseck followed me. Outside in the street I separated
      from him, but he came after me, flung me one of those searching glances
      with which he probed men&rsquo;s minds, and said in the husky flute-tones,
      pitched in a shriller key:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you take it upon yourself to judge me?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From that time forward we saw little of each other. Gobseck let the
      Count&rsquo;s mansion on lease; he spent the summers on the country estates. He
      was a lord of the manor in earnest, putting up farm buildings, repairing
      mills and roadways, and planting timber. I came across him one day in a
      walk in the Jardin des Tuileries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Countess is behaving like a heroine,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;she gives herself up
      entirely to the children&rsquo;s education; she is giving them a perfect
      bringing up. The oldest boy is a charming young fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But ought you not to help Ernest?&rsquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Help him!&rsquo; cried Gobseck. &lsquo;Not I. Adversity is the greatest of all
      teachers; adversity teaches us to know the value of money and the worth of
      men and women. Let him set sail on the seas of Paris; when he is a
      qualified pilot, we will give him a ship to steer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left him without seeking to explain the meaning of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Restaud&rsquo;s mother has prejudiced him against me, and he is very far
      from taking me as his legal adviser; still, I went to see Gobseck last
      week to tell him about Ernest&rsquo;s love for Mlle. Camille, and pressed him to
      carry out his contract, since that young Restaud is just of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the old bill-discounter had been kept to his bed for a long time
      by the complaint of which he was to die. He put me off, saying that he
      would give the matter his attention when he could get up again and see
      after his business; his idea being no doubt that he would not give up any
      of his possessions so long as the breath was in him; no other reason could
      be found for his shuffling answer. He seemed to me to be much worse than
      he at all suspected. I stayed with him long enough to discern the progress
      of a passion which age had converted into a sort of craze. He wanted to be
      alone in the house, and had taken the rooms one by one as they fell
      vacant. In his own room he had changed nothing; the furniture which I knew
      so well sixteen years ago looked the same as ever; it might have been kept
      under a glass case. Gobseck&rsquo;s faithful old portress, with her husband, a
      pensioner, who sat in the entry while she was upstairs, was still his
      housekeeper and charwoman, and now in addition his sick-nurse. In spite of
      his feebleness, Gobseck saw his clients himself as heretofore, and
      received sums of money; his affairs had been so simplified, that he only
      needed to send his pensioner out now and again on an errand, and could
      carry on business in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the treaty, by which France recognized the Haytian Republic,
      Gobseck was one of the members of the commission appointed to liquidate
      claims and assess repayments due by Hayti; his special knowledge of old
      fortunes in San Domingo, and the planters and their heirs and assigns to
      whom the indemnities were due, had led to his nomination. Gobseck&rsquo;s
      peculiar genius had then devised an agency for discounting the planters&rsquo; 
      claims on the government. The business was carried on under the names of
      Werbrust and Gigonnet, with whom he shared the spoil without
      disbursements, for his knowledge was accepted instead of capital. The
      agency was a sort of distillery, in which money was extracted from
      doubtful claims, and the claims of those who knew no better, or had no
      confidence in the government. As a liquidator, Gobseck could make terms
      with the large landed proprietors; and these, either to gain a higher
      percentage of their claims, or to ensure prompt settlements, would send
      him presents in proportion to their means. In this way presents came to be
      a kind of percentage upon sums too large to pass through his control,
      while the agency bought up cheaply the small and dubious claims, or the
      claims of those persons who preferred a little ready money to a deferred
      and somewhat hazy repayment by the Republic. Gobseck was the insatiable
      boa constrictor of the great business. Every morning he received his
      tribute, eyeing it like a Nabob&rsquo;s prime minister, as he considers whether
      he will sign a pardon. Gobseck would take anything, from the present of
      game sent him by some poor devil or the pound&rsquo;s weight of wax candles from
      devout folk, to the rich man&rsquo;s plate and the speculator&rsquo;s gold snuff-box.
      Nobody knew what became of the presents sent to the old money-lender.
      Everything went in, but nothing came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the word of an honest woman,&rsquo; said the portress, an old acquaintance
      of mine, &lsquo;I believe he swallows it all and is none the fatter for it; he
      is as thin and dried up as the cuckoo in the clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length, last Monday, Gobseck sent his pensioner for me. The man came
      up to my private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be quick and come, M. Derville,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the governor is just going to
      hand in his checks; he has grown as yellow as a lemon; he is fidgeting to
      speak with you; death has fair hold of him; the rattle is working in his
      throat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I entered Gobseck&rsquo;s room, I found the dying man kneeling before the
      grate. If there was no fire on the hearth, there was at any rate a
      monstrous heap of ashes. He had dragged himself out of bed, but his
      strength had failed him, and he could neither go back nor find the voice
      to complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You felt cold, old friend,&rsquo; I said, as I helped him back to his bed;
      &lsquo;how can you do without a fire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am not cold at all,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;No fire here! no fire! I am going, I
      know not where, lad,&rsquo; he went on, glancing at me with blank, lightless
      eyes, &lsquo;but I am going away from this.&mdash;I have <i>carpology</i>,&rsquo; said
      he (the use of the technical term showing how clear and accurate his
      mental processes were even now). &lsquo;I thought the room was full of live
      gold, and I got up to catch some of it.&mdash;To whom will all mine go, I
      wonder? Not to the crown; I have left a will, look for it, Grotius. <i>La
      belle Hollandaise</i> had a daughter; I once saw the girl somewhere or
      other, in the Rue Vivienne, one evening. They call her &ldquo;<i>La Torpille</i>,&rdquo;
       I believe; she is as pretty as pretty can be; look her up, Grotius. You
      are my executor; take what you like; help yourself. There are Strasburg
      pies, there, and bags of coffee, and sugar, and gold spoons. Give the
      Odiot service to your wife. But who is to have the diamonds? Are you going
      to take them, lad? There is snuff too&mdash;sell it at Hamburg, tobaccos
      are worth half as much again at Hamburg. All sorts of things I have in
      fact, and now I must go and leave them all.&mdash;Come, Papa Gobseck, no
      weakness, be yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He raised himself in bed, the lines of his face standing out as sharply
      against the pillow as if the profile had been cast in bronze; he stretched
      out a lean arm and bony hand along the coverlet and clutched it, as if so
      he would fain keep his hold on life, then he gazed hard at the grate, cold
      as his own metallic eyes, and died in full consciousness of death. To us&mdash;the
      portress, the old pensioner, and myself&mdash;he looked like one of the
      old Romans standing behind the Consuls in Lethiere&rsquo;s picture of the <i>Death
      of the Sons of Brutus</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He was a good-plucked one, the old Lascar!&rsquo; said the pensioner in his
      soldierly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as for me, the dying man&rsquo;s fantastical enumeration of his riches
      still sounding in my ears, and my eyes, following the direction of his,
      rested on that heap of ashes. It struck me that it was very large. I took
      the tongs, and as soon as I stirred the cinders, I felt the metal
      underneath, a mass of gold and silver coins, receipts taken during his
      illness, doubtless, after he grew too feeble to lock the money up, and
      could trust no one to take it to the bank for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Run for the justice of the peace,&rsquo; said I, turning to the old pensioner,
      &lsquo;so that everything can be sealed here at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobseck&rsquo;s last words and the old portress&rsquo; remarks had struck me. I took
      the keys of the rooms on the first and second floor to make a visitation.
      The first door that I opened revealed the meaning of the phrases which I
      took for mad ravings; and I saw the length to which covetousness goes when
      it survives only as an illogical instinct, the last stage of greed of
      which you find so many examples among misers in country towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the room next to the one in which Gobseck had died, a quantity of
      eatables of all kinds were stored&mdash;putrid pies, mouldy fish, nay,
      even shell-fish, the stench almost choked me. Maggots and insects swarmed.
      These comparatively recent presents were put down, pell-mell, among chests
      of tea, bags of coffee, and packing-cases of every shape. A silver soup
      tureen on the chimney-piece was full of advices of the arrival of goods
      consigned to his order at Havre, bales of cotton, hogsheads of sugar,
      barrels of rum, coffees, indigo, tobaccos, a perfect bazaar of colonial
      produce. The room itself was crammed with furniture, and silver-plate, and
      lamps, and vases, and pictures; there were books, and curiosities, and
      fine engravings lying rolled up, unframed. Perhaps these were not all
      presents, and some part of this vast quantity of stuff had been deposited
      with him in the shape of pledges, and had been left on his hands in
      default of payment. I noticed jewel-cases, with ciphers and armorial
      bearings stamped upon them, and sets of fine table-linen, and weapons of
      price; but none of the things were docketed. I opened a book which seemed
      to be misplaced, and found a thousand-franc note in it. I promised myself
      that I would go through everything thoroughly; I would try the ceilings,
      and floors, and walls, and cornices to discover all the gold, hoarded with
      such passionate greed by a Dutch miser worthy of a Rembrandt&rsquo;s brush. In
      all the course of my professional career I have never seen such impressive
      signs of the eccentricity of avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went back to his room, and found an explanation of this chaos and
      accumulation of riches in a pile of letters lying under the paper-weights
      on his desk&mdash;Gobseck&rsquo;s correspondence with the various dealers to
      whom doubtless he usually sold his presents. These persons had, perhaps,
      fallen victims to Gobseck&rsquo;s cleverness, or Gobseck may have wanted fancy
      prices for his goods; at any rate, every bargain hung in suspense. He had
      not disposed of the eatables to Chevet, because Chevet would only take
      them of him at a loss of thirty per cent. Gobseck haggled for a few francs
      between the prices, and while they wrangled the goods became unsalable.
      Again, Gobseck had refused free delivery of his silver-plate, and declined
      to guarantee the weights of his coffees. There had been a dispute over
      each article, the first indication in Gobseck of the childishness and
      incomprehensible obstinacy of age, a condition of mind reached at last by
      all men in whom a strong passion survives the intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said to myself, as he had said, &lsquo;To whom will all these riches go?&rsquo; ...
      And then I think of the grotesque information he gave me as to the present
      address of his heiress, I foresee that it will be my duty to search all
      the houses of ill-fame in Paris to pour out an immense fortune on some
      worthless jade. But, in the first place, know this&mdash;that in a few
      days time Ernest de Restaud will come into a fortune to which his title is
      unquestionable, a fortune which will put him in a position to marry Mlle.
      Camille, even after adequate provision has been made for his mother the
      Comtesse de Restaud and his sister and brother.&rdquo;

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
