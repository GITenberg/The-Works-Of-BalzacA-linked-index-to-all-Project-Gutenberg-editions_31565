                              DEDICATION

                           To Jacques Strunz.

  MY DEAR STRUNZ:&mdash;I should be ungrateful if I did not set your name
  at the head of one of the two tales I could never have written but
  for your patient kindness and care. Accept this as my grateful
  acknowledgment of the readiness with which you tried&mdash;perhaps not
  very successfully&mdash;to initiate me into the mysteries of musical
  knowledge. You have at least taught me what difficulties and what
  labor genius must bury in those poems which procure us
  transcendental pleasures. You have also afforded me the
  satisfaction of laughing more than once at the expense of a
  self-styled connoisseur.

  Some have taxed me with ignorance, not knowing that I have taken
  counsel of one of our best musical critics, and had the benefit of
  your conscientious help. I have, perhaps, been an inaccurate
  amanuensis. If this were the case, I should be the traitorous
  translator without knowing it, and I yet hope to sign myself
  always one of your friends.

                                                         DE BALZAC.

    <p>
      As all who are learned in such matters know, the Venetian aristocracy is
      the first in Europe. Its <i>Libro d&rsquo;Oro</i> dates from before the
      Crusades, from a time when Venice, a survivor of Imperial and Christian
      Rome which had flung itself into the waters to escape the Barbarians, was
      already powerful and illustrious, and the head of the political and
      commercial world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a few rare exceptions this brilliant nobility has fallen into utter
      ruin. Among the gondoliers who serve the English&mdash;to whom history
      here reads the lesson of their future fate&mdash;there are descendants of
      long dead Doges whose names are older than those of sovereigns. On some
      bridge, as you glide past it, if you are ever in Venice, you may admire
      some lovely girl in rags, a poor child belonging, perhaps, to one of the
      most famous patrician families. When a nation of kings has fallen so low,
      naturally some curious characters will be met with. It is not surprising
      that sparks should flash out among the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections, intended to justify the singularity of the persons who
      figure in this narrative, shall not be indulged in any longer, for there
      is nothing more intolerable than the stale reminiscences of those who
      insist on talking about Venice after so many great poets and petty
      travelers. The interest of the tale requires only this record of the most
      startling contrast in the life of man: the dignity and poverty which are
      conspicuous there in some of the men as they are in most of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobles of Venice and of Geneva, like those of Poland in former times,
      bore no titles. To be named Quirini, Doria, Brignole, Morosini, Sauli,
      Mocenigo, Fieschi, Cornaro, or Spinola, was enough for the pride of the
      haughtiest. But all things become corrupt. At the present day some of
      these families have titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even at a time when the nobles of the aristocratic republics were all
      equal, the title of Prince was, in fact, given at Genoa to a member of the
      Doria family, who were sovereigns of the principality of Amalfi, and a
      similar title was in use at Venice, justified by ancient inheritance from
      Facino Cane, Prince of Varese. The Grimaldi, who assumed sovereignty, did
      not take possession of Monaco till much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last Cane of the elder branch vanished from Venice thirty years before
      the fall of the Republic, condemned for various crimes more or less
      criminal. The branch on whom this nominal principality then devolved, the
      Cane Memmi, sank into poverty during the fatal period between 1796 and
      1814. In the twentieth year of the present century they were represented
      only by a young man whose name was Emilio, and an old palace which is
      regarded as one of the chief ornaments of the Grand Canal. This son of
      Venice the Fair had for his whole fortune this useless Palazzo, and
      fifteen hundred francs a year derived from a country house on the Brenta,
      the last plot of the lands his family had formerly owned on <i>terra firma</i>,
      and sold to the Austrian government. This little income spared our
      handsome Emilio the ignominy of accepting, as many nobles did, the
      indemnity of a franc a day, due to every impoverished patrician under the
      stipulations of the cession to Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of winter, this young gentleman was still lingering in a
      country house situated at the base of the Tyrolese Alps, and purchased in
      the previous spring by the Duchess Cataneo. The house, erected by Palladio
      for the Piepolo family, is a square building of the finest style of
      architecture. There is a stately staircase with a marble portico on each
      side; the vestibules are crowded with frescoes, and made light by sky-blue
      ceilings across which graceful figures float amid ornament rich in design,
      but so well proportioned that the building carries it, as a woman carries
      her head-dress, with an ease that charms the eye; in short, the grace and
      dignity that characterize the <i>Procuratie</i> in the piazetta at Venice.
      Stone walls, admirably decorated, keep the rooms at a pleasantly cool
      temperature. Verandas outside, painted in fresco, screen off the glare.
      The flooring throughout is the old Venetian inlay of marbles, cut into
      unfading flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture, like that of all Italian palaces, was rich with handsome
      silks, judiciously employed, and valuable pictures favorably hung; some by
      the Genoese priest, known as <i>il Capucino</i>, several by Leonardo da
      Vinci, Carlo Dolci, Tintoretto, and Titian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shelving gardens were full of the marvels where money has been turned
      into rocky grottoes and patterns of shells,&mdash;the very madness of
      craftsmanship,&mdash;terraces laid out by the fairies, arbors of sterner
      aspect, where the cypress on its tall trunk, the triangular pines, and the
      melancholy olive mingled pleasingly with orange trees, bays, and myrtles,
      and clear pools in which blue or russet fishes swam. Whatever may be said
      in favor of the natural or English garden, these trees, pruned into
      parasols, and yews fantastically clipped; this luxury of art so skilfully
      combined with that of nature in Court dress; those cascades over marble
      steps where the water spreads so shyly, a filmy scarf swept aside by the
      wind and immediately renewed; those bronzed metal figures speechlessly
      inhabiting the silent grove; that lordly palace, an object in the
      landscape from every side, raising its light outline at the foot of the
      Alps,&mdash;all the living thoughts which animate the stone, the bronze,
      and the trees, or express themselves in garden plots,&mdash;this lavish
      prodigality was in perfect keeping with the loves of a duchess and a
      handsome youth, for they are a poem far removed from the coarse ends of
      brutal nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one with a soul for fantasy would have looked to see, on one of those
      noble flights of steps, standing by a vase with medallions in bas-relief,
      a negro boy swathed about the loins with scarlet stuff, and holding in one
      hand a parasol over the Duchess&rsquo; head, and in the other the train of her
      long skirt, while she listened to Emilio Memmi. And how far grander the
      Venetian would have looked in such a dress as the Senators wore whom
      Titian painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! in this fairy palace, not unlike that of the Peschieri at Genoa,
      the Duchess Cataneo obeyed the edicts of Victorine and the Paris fashions.
      She had on a muslin dress and broad straw hat, pretty shot silk shoes,
      thread lace stockings that a breath of air would have blown away; and over
      her shoulders a black lace shawl. But the thing which no one could ever
      understand in Paris, where women are sheathed in their dresses as a
      dragon-fly is cased in its annular armor, was the perfect freedom with
      which this lovely daughter of Tuscany wore her French attire; she had
      Italianized it. A Frenchwoman treats her shirt with the greatest
      seriousness; an Italian never thinks about it; she does not attempt
      self-protection by some prim glance, for she knows that she is safe in
      that of a devoted love, a passion as sacred and serious in her eyes as in
      those of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven in the forenoon, after a walk, and by the side of a table still
      strewn with the remains of an elegant breakfast, the Duchess, lounging in
      an easy-chair, left her lover the master of these muslin draperies,
      without a frown each time he moved. Emilio, seated at her side, held one
      of her hands between his, gazing at her with utter absorption. Ask not
      whether they loved; they loved only too well. They were not reading out of
      the same book, like Paolo and Francesca; far from it, Emilio dared not
      say: &ldquo;Let us read.&rdquo; The gleam of those eyes, those glistening gray irises
      streaked with threads of gold that started from the centre like rifts of
      light, giving her gaze a soft, star-like radiance, thrilled him with
      nervous rapture that was almost a spasm. Sometimes the mere sight of the
      splendid black hair that crowned the adored head, bound by a simple gold
      fillet, and falling in satin tresses on each side of a spacious brow, was
      enough to give him a ringing in his ears, the wild tide of the blood
      rushing through his veins as if it must burst his heart. By what obscure
      phenomenon did his soul so overmaster his body that he was no longer
      conscious of his independent self, but was wholly one with this woman at
      the least word she spoke in that voice which disturbed the very sources of
      life in him? If, in utter seclusion, a woman of moderate charms can, by
      being constantly studied, seem supreme and imposing, perhaps one so
      magnificently handsome as the Duchess could fascinate to stupidity a youth
      in whom rapture found some fresh incitement; for she had really absorbed
      his young soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla, the heiress of the Doni, of Florence, had married the Sicilian
      Duke Cataneo. Her mother, since dead, had hoped, by promoting this
      marriage, to leave her rich and happy, according to Florentine custom. She
      had concluded that her daughter, emerging from a convent to embark in
      life, would achieve, under the laws of love, that second union of heart
      with heart which, to an Italian woman, is all in all. But Massimilla Doni
      had acquired in her convent a real taste for a religious life, and, when
      she had pledged her troth to Duke Cataneo, she was Christianly content to
      be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an untenable position. Cataneo, who only looked for a duchess,
      thought himself ridiculous as a husband; and, when Massimilla complained
      of this indifference, he calmly bid her look about her for a <i>cavaliere
      servente</i>, even offering his services to introduce to her some youths
      from whom to choose. The Duchess wept; the Duke made his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla looked about her at the world that crowded round her; her
      mother took her to the Pergola, to some ambassadors&rsquo; drawing-rooms, to the
      Cascine&mdash;wherever handsome young men of fashion were to be met; she
      saw none to her mind, and determined to travel. Then she lost her mother,
      inherited her property, assumed mourning, and made her way to Venice.
      There she saw Emilio, who, as he went past her opera box, exchanged with
      her a flash of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all. The Venetian was thunderstruck, while a voice in the
      Duchess&rsquo; ear called out: &ldquo;This is he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anywhere else two persons more prudent and less guileless would have
      studied and examined each other; but these two ignorances mingled like two
      masses of homogeneous matter, which, when they meet, form but one.
      Massimilla was at once and thenceforth Venetian. She bought the palazzo
      she had rented on the Canareggio; and then, not knowing how to invest her
      wealth, she had purchased Rivalta, the country-place where she was now
      staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio, being introduced to the Duchess by the Signora Vulpato, waited
      very respectfully on the lady in her box all through the winter. Never was
      love more ardent in two souls, or more bashful in its advances. The two
      children were afraid of each other. Massimilla was no coquette. She had no
      second string to her bow, no <i>secondo</i>, no <i>terzo</i>, no <i>patito</i>.
      Satisfied with a smile and a word, she admired her Venetian youth, with
      his pointed face, his long, thin nose, his black eyes, and noble brow;
      but, in spite of her artless encouragement, he never went to her house
      till they had spent three months in getting used to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then summer brought its Eastern sky. The Duchess lamented having to go
      alone to Rivalta. Emilio, at once happy and uneasy at the thought of being
      alone with her, had accompanied Massimilla to her retreat. And now this
      pretty pair had been there for six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla, now twenty, had not sacrificed her religious principles to her
      passion without a struggle. Still they had yielded, though tardily; and at
      this moment she would have been ready to consummate the love union for
      which her mother had prepared her, as Emilio sat there holding her
      beautiful, aristocratic hand,&mdash;long, white, and sheeny, ending in
      fine, rosy nails, as if she had procured from Asia some of the henna with
      which the Sultan&rsquo;s wives dye their fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A misfortune, of which she was unconscious, but which was torture to
      Emilio, kept up a singular barrier between them. Massimilla, young as she
      was, had the majestic bearing which mythological tradition ascribes to
      Juno, the only goddess to whom it does not give a lover; for Diana, the
      chaste Diana, loved! Jupiter alone could hold his own with his divine
      better-half, on whom many English ladies model themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio set his mistress far too high ever to touch her. A year hence,
      perhaps, he might not be a victim to this noble error which attacks none
      but very young or very old men. But as the archer who shoots beyond the
      mark is as far from it as he whose arrow falls short of it, the Duchess
      found herself between a husband who knew he was so far from reaching the
      target, that he had ceased to try for it, and a lover who was carried so
      much past it on the white wings of an angel, that he could not get back to
      it. Massimilla could be happy with desire, not imagining its issue; but
      her lover, distressful in his happiness, would sometimes obtain from his
      beloved a promise that led her to the edge of what many women call &ldquo;the
      gulf,&rdquo; and thus found himself obliged to be satisfied with plucking the
      flowers at the edge, incapable of daring more than to pull off their
      petals, and smother his torture in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had wandered out together that morning, repeating such a hymn of love
      as the birds warbled in the branches. On their return, the youth, whose
      situation can only be described by comparing him to the cherubs
      represented by painters as having only a head and wings, had been so
      impassioned as to venture to hint a doubt as to the Duchess&rsquo; entire
      devotion, so as to bring her to the point of saying: &ldquo;What proof do you
      need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question had been asked with a royal air, and Memmi had ardently
      kissed the beautiful and guileless hand. Then he suddenly started up in a
      rage with himself, and left the Duchess. Massimilla remained in her
      indolent attitude on the sofa; but she wept, wondering how, young and
      handsome as she was, she could fail to please Emilio. Memmi, on the other
      hand, knocked his head against the tree-trunks like a hooded crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment a servant came in pursuit of the young Venetian to
      deliver a letter brought by express messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marco Vendramini,&mdash;a name also pronounced Vendramin, in the Venetian
      dialect, which drops many final letters,&mdash;his only friend, wrote to
      tell him that Facino Cane, Prince of Varese, had died in a hospital in
      Paris. Proofs of his death had come to hand, and the Cane-Memmi were
      Princes of Varese. In the eyes of the two young men a title without wealth
      being worthless, Vendramin also informed Emilio, as a far more important
      fact, of the engagement at the <i>Fenice</i> of the famous tenor Genovese,
      and the no less famous Signora Tinti.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting to finish the letter, which he crumpled up and put in his
      pocket, Emilio ran to communicate this great news to the Duchess,
      forgetting his heraldic honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess knew nothing of the strange story which made la Tinti an
      object of curiosity in Italy, and Emilio briefly repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This illustrious singer had been a mere inn-servant, whose wonderful voice
      had captivated a great Sicilian nobleman on his travels. The girl&rsquo;s beauty&mdash;she
      was then twelve years old&mdash;being worthy of her voice, the gentleman
      had had the moderation to have brought her up, as Louis XV. had
      Mademoiselle de Romans educated. He had waited patiently till Clara&rsquo;s
      voice had been fully trained by a famous professor, and till she was
      sixteen, before taking toll of the treasure so carefully cultivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Tinti had made her debut the year before, and had enchanted the three
      most fastidious capitals of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly certain that her great nobleman is not my husband,&rdquo; said
      the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were ordered, and the Duchess set out at once for Venice, to be
      present at the opening of the winter season.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one fine evening in November, the new Prince of Varese was crossing the
      lagoon from Mestre to Venice, between the lines of stakes painted with
      Austrian colors, which mark out the channel for gondolas as conceded by
      the custom-house. As he watched Massimilla&rsquo;s gondola, navigated by men in
      livery, and cutting through the water a few yards in front, poor Emilio,
      with only an old gondolier who had been his father&rsquo;s servant in the days
      when Venice was still a living city, could not repress the bitter
      reflections suggested to him by the assumption of his title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a mockery of fortune! A prince&mdash;with fifteen hundred francs a
      year! Master of one of the finest palaces in the world, and unable to sell
      the statues, stairs, paintings, sculpture, which an Austrian decree had
      made inalienable! To live on a foundation of piles of campeachy wood worth
      nearly a million of francs, and have no furniture! To own sumptuous
      galleries, and live in an attic above the topmost arabesque cornice
      constructed of marble brought from the Morea&mdash;the land which a
      Memmius had marched over as conqueror in the time of the Romans! To see
      his ancestors in effigy on their tombs of precious marbles in one of the
      most splendid churches in Venice, and in a chapel graced with pictures by
      Titian and Tintoretto, by Palma, Bellini, Paul Veronese&mdash;and to be
      prohibited from selling a marble Memmi to the English for bread for the
      living Prince Varese! Genovese, the famous tenor, could get in one season,
      by his warbling, the capital of an income on which this son of the Memmi
      could live&mdash;this descendant of Roman senators as venerable as Caesar
      and Sylla. Genovese may smoke an Eastern hookah, and the Prince of Varese
      cannot even have enough cigars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed the end he was smoking into the sea. The Prince of Varese found
      cigars at the Duchess Cataneo&rsquo;s; how gladly would he have laid the
      treasures of the world at her feet! She studied all his caprices, and was
      happy to gratify them. He made his only meal at her house&mdash;his
      supper; for all his money was spent in clothes and his place in the <i>Fenice</i>.
      He had also to pay a hundred francs a year as wages to his father&rsquo;s old
      gondolier; and he, to serve him for that sum, had to live exclusively on
      rice. Also he kept enough to take a cup of black coffee every morning at
      Florian&rsquo;s to keep himself up till the evening in a state of nervous
      excitement, and this habit, carried to excess, he hoped would in due time
      kill him, as Vendramin relied on opium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am a prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the words, Emilio Memmi tossed Marco Vendramin&rsquo;s letter into
      the lagoon without even reading it to the end, and it floated away like a
      paper boat launched by a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Emilio,&rdquo; he went on to himself, &ldquo;is but three and twenty. He is a
      better man than Lord Wellington with the gout, than the paralyzed Regent,
      than the epileptic royal family of Austria, than the King of France&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as he thought of the King of France Emilio&rsquo;s brow was knit, his ivory
      skin burned yellower, tears gathered in his black eyes and hung to his
      long lashes; he raised a hand worthy to be painted by Titian to push back
      his thick brown hair, and gazed again at Massimilla&rsquo;s gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this insolent mockery of fate is carried even into my love affair,&rdquo;
       said he to himself. &ldquo;My heart and imagination are full of precious gifts;
      Massimilla will have none of them; she is a Florentine, and she will throw
      me over. I have to sit by her side like ice, while her voice and her looks
      fire me with heavenly sensations! As I watch her gondola a few hundred
      feet away from my own I feel as if a hot iron were set on my heart. An
      invisible fluid courses through my frame and scorches my nerves, a cloud
      dims my sight, the air seems to me to glow as it did at Rivalta when the
      sunlight came through a red silk blind, and I, without her knowing it,
      could admire her lost in dreams, with her subtle smile like that of
      Leonardo&rsquo;s Mona Lisa. Well, either my Highness will end my days by a
      pistol-shot, or the heir of the Cane will follow old Carmagnola&rsquo;s advice;
      we will be sailors, pirates; and it will be amusing to see how long we can
      live without being hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince lighted another cigar, and watched the curls of smoke as the
      wind wafted them away, as though he saw in their arabesques an echo of
      this last thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distance he could now perceive the mauresque pinnacles that crowned
      his palazzo, and he was sadder than ever. The Duchess&rsquo; gondola had
      vanished in the Canareggio.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fantastic pictures of a romantic and perilous existence, as the
      outcome of his love, went out with his cigar, and his lady&rsquo;s gondola no
      longer traced his path. Then he saw the present in its real light: a
      palace without a soul, a soul that had no effect on the body, a
      principality without money, an empty body and a full heart&mdash;a
      thousand heartbreaking contradictions. The hapless youth mourned for
      Venice as she had been,&mdash;as did Vendramini, even more bitterly, for
      it was a great and common sorrow, a similar destiny, that had engendered
      such a warm friendship between these two young men, the wreckage of two
      illustrious families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio could not help dreaming of a time when the palazzo Memmi poured out
      light from every window, and rang with music carried far away over the
      Adriatic tide; when hundreds of gondolas might be seen tied up to its
      mooring-posts, while graceful masked figures and the magnates of the
      Republic crowded up the steps kissed by the waters; when its halls and
      gallery were full of a throng of intriguers or their dupes; when the great
      banqueting-hall, filled with merry feasters, and the upper balconies
      furnished with musicians, seemed to harbor all Venice coming and going on
      the great staircase that rang with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chisels of the greatest artists of many centuries had sculptured the
      bronze brackets supporting long-necked or pot-bellied Chinese vases, and
      the candelabra for a thousand tapers. Every country had furnished some
      contribution to the splendor that decked the walls and ceilings. But now
      the panels were stripped of the handsome hangings, the melancholy ceilings
      were speechless and sad. No Turkey carpets, no lustres bright with
      flowers, no statues, no pictures, no more joy, no money&mdash;the great
      means to enjoyment! Venice, the London of the Middle Ages, was falling
      stone by stone, man by man. The ominous green weed which the sea washes
      and kisses at the foot of every palace, was in the Prince&rsquo;s eyes, a black
      fringe hung by nature as an omen of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, a great English poet had rushed down on Venice like a raven
      on a corpse, to croak out in lyric poetry&mdash;the first and last
      utterance of social man&mdash;the burden of a <i>de profundis</i>. English
      poetry! Flung in the face of the city that had given birth to Italian
      poetry! Poor Venice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive, then, of the young man&rsquo;s amazement when roused from such
      meditations by Carmagnola&rsquo;s cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serenissimo, the palazzo is on fire, or the old Doges have risen from
      their tombs! There are lights in the windows of the upper floor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Emilio fancied that his dream was realized by the touch of a magic
      wand. It was dusk, and the old gondolier could by tying up his gondola to
      the top step, help his young master to land without being seen by the
      bustling servants in the palazzo, some of whom were buzzing about the
      landing-place like bees at the door of a hive. Emilio stole into the great
      hall, whence rose the finest flight of stairs in all Venice, up which he
      lightly ran to investigate the cause of this strange bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole tribe of workmen were hurriedly completing the furnishing and
      redecoration of the palace. The first floor, worthy of the antique glories
      of Venice, displayed to Emilio&rsquo;s waking eyes the magnificence of which he
      had just been dreaming, and the fairy had exercised admirable taste.
      Splendor worthy of a parvenu sovereign was to be seen even in the smallest
      details. Emilio wandered about without remark from anybody, and surprise
      followed on surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious, then, to know what was going forward on the second floor, he went
      up, and found everything finished. The unknown laborers, commissioned by a
      wizard to revive the marvels of the Arabian nights in behalf of an
      impoverished Italian prince, were exchanging some inferior articles of
      furniture brought in for the nonce. Prince Emilio made his way into the
      bedroom, which smiled on him like a shell just deserted by Venus. The room
      was so charmingly pretty, so daintily smart, so full of elegant
      contrivance, that he straightway seated himself in an armchair of gilt
      wood, in front of which a most appetizing cold supper stood ready, and,
      without more ado, proceeded to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all the world there is no one but Massimilla who would have thought of
      this surprise,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;She heard that I was now a prince; Duke
      Cataneo is perhaps dead, and has left her his fortune; she is twice as
      rich as she was; she will marry me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he ate in a way that would have roused the envy of an invalid Croesus,
      if he could have seen him; and he drank floods of capital port wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I understand the knowing little air she put on as she said, &lsquo;Till
      this evening!&rsquo; Perhaps she means to come and break the spell. What a fine
      bed! and in the bed-place such a pretty lamp! Quite a Florentine idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are some strongly blended natures on which extremes of joy or of
      grief have a soporific effect. Now on a youth so compounded that he could
      idealize his mistress to the point of ceasing to think of her as a woman,
      this sudden incursion of wealth had the effect of a dose of opium. When
      the Prince had drunk the whole of the bottle of port, eaten half a fish
      and some portion of a French pate, he felt an irresistible longing for
      bed. Perhaps he was suffering from a double intoxication. So he pulled off
      the counterpane, opened the bed, undressed in a pretty dressing-room, and
      lay down to meditate on destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot poor Carmagnola,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but my cook and butler will have
      provided for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, a waiting-woman came in, lightly humming an air from the
      <i>Barbiere</i>. She tossed a woman&rsquo;s dress on a chair, a whole outfit for
      the night, and said as she did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in fact a few minutes later a young lady came in, dressed in the
      latest French style, who might have sat for some English fancy portrait
      engraved for a <i>Forget-me-not</i>, a <i>Belle Assemblee</i>, or a <i>Book
      of Beauty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince shivered with delight and with fear, for, as you know, he was
      in love with Massimilla. But, in spite of this faith in love which fired
      his blood, and which of old inspired the painters of Spain, which gave
      Italy her Madonnas, created Michael Angelo&rsquo;s statues and Ghilberti&rsquo;s doors
      of the Baptistery,&mdash;desire had him in its toils, and agitated him
      without infusing into his heart that warm, ethereal glow which he felt at
      a look or a word from the Duchess. His soul, his heart, his reason, every
      impulse of his will, revolted at the thought of an infidelity; and yet
      that brutal, unreasoning infidelity domineered over his spirit. But the
      woman was not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince saw one of those figures in which nobody believes when they are
      transferred from real life, where we wonder at them, to the imaginary
      existence of a more or less literary description. The dress of this
      stranger, like that of all Neapolitans, displayed five colors, if the
      black of his hat may count for a color; his trousers were olive-brown, his
      red waistcoat shone with gilt buttons, his coat was greenish, and his
      linen was more yellow than white. This personage seemed to have made it
      his business to verify the Neapolitan as represented by Gerolamo on the
      stage of his puppet show. His eyes looked like glass beads. His nose, like
      the ace of clubs, was horribly long and bulbous; in fact, it did its best
      to conceal an opening which it would be an insult to the human countenance
      to call a mouth; within, three or four tusks were visible, endowed, as it
      seemed, with a proper motion and fitting into each other. His fleshy ears
      drooped by their own weight, giving the creature a whimsical resemblance
      to a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      His complexion, tainted, no doubt, by various metallic infusions as
      prescribed by some Hippocrates, verged on black. A pointed skull, scarcely
      covered by a few straight hairs like spun glass, crowned this forbidding
      face with red spots. Finally, though the man was very thin and of medium
      height, he had long arms and broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these hideous details, and though he looked fully seventy, he
      did not lack a certain cyclopean dignity; he had aristocratic manners and
      the confident demeanor of a rich man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one who could have found courage enough to study him, would have seen
      his history written by base passions on this noble clay degraded to mud.
      Here was the man of high birth, who, rich from his earliest youth, had
      given up his body to debauchery for the sake of extravagant enjoyment. And
      debauchery had destroyed the human being and made another after its own
      image. Thousands of bottles of wine had disappeared under the purple
      archway of that preposterous nose, and left their dregs on his lips. Long
      and slow digestion had destroyed his teeth. His eyes had grown dim under
      the lamps of the gaming table. The blood tainted with impurities had
      vitiated the nervous system. The expenditure of force in the task of
      digestion had undermined his intellect. Finally, amours had thinned his
      hair. Each vice, like a greedy heir, had stamped possession on some part
      of the living body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who watch nature detect her in jests of the shrewdest irony. For
      instance, she places toads in the neighborhood of flowers, as she had
      placed this man by the side of this rose of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you play the violin this evening, my dear Duke?&rdquo; asked the woman, as
      she unhooked a cord to let a handsome curtain fall over the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play the violin!&rdquo; thought Prince Emilio. &ldquo;What can have happened to my
      palazzo? Am I awake? Here I am, in that woman&rsquo;s bed, and she certainly
      thinks herself at home&mdash;she has taken off her cloak! Have I, like
      Vendramin, inhaled opium, and am I in the midst of one of those dreams in
      which he sees Venice as it was three centuries ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unknown fair one, seated in front of a dressing-table blazing with wax
      lights, was unfastening her frippery with the utmost calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring for Giulia,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I want to get my dress off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant, the Duke noticed that the supper had been disturbed; he
      looked round the room, and discovered the Prince&rsquo;s trousers hanging over a
      chair at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clarina, I will not ring!&rdquo; cried the Duke, in a shrill voice of fury. &ldquo;I
      will not play the violin this evening, nor tomorrow, nor ever again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta!&rdquo; sang Clarina, on the four octaves of the same note,
      leaping from one to the next with the ease of a nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of that voice, which would make your patron saint Clara envious,
      you are really too impudent, you rascally hussy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not brought me up to listen to such abuse,&rdquo; said she, with some
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I brought you up to hide a man in your bed? You are unworthy alike
      of my generosity and of my hatred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in my bed!&rdquo; exclaimed Clarina, hastily looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after daring to eat our supper, as if he were at home,&rdquo; added the
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I not at home?&rdquo; cried Emilio. &ldquo;I am the Prince of Varese; this
      palace is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Emilio sat up in bed, his handsome and noble Venetian head
      framed in the flowing hangings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Clarina laughed&mdash;one of those irrepressible fits of laughter
      which seize a girl when she meets with an adventure comic beyond all
      conception. But her laughter ceased as she saw the young man, who, as has
      been said, was remarkably handsome, though but lightly attired; the
      madness that possessed Emilio seized her, too, and, as she had no one to
      adore, no sense of reason bridled her sudden fancy&mdash;a Sicilian woman
      in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although this is the palazzo Memmi, I will thank your Highness to quit,&rdquo;
       said the Duke, assuming the cold irony of a polished gentleman. &ldquo;I am at
      home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you, Monsieur le Duc, that you are in my room, not in your
      own,&rdquo; said Clarina, rousing herself from her amazement. &ldquo;If you have any
      doubts of my virtue, at any rate give me the benefit of my crime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubts! Say proof positive, my lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you that I am innocent,&rdquo; replied Clarina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, do I see in that bed?&rdquo; asked the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Ogre!&rdquo; cried Clarina. &ldquo;If you believe your eyes rather than my
      assertion, you have ceased to love me. Go, and do not weary my ears! Do
      you hear? Go, Monsieur le Duc. This young Prince will repay you the
      million francs I have cost you, if you insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will repay nothing,&rdquo; said Emilio in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing due! A million is cheap for Clara Tinti when a man is so
      ugly. Now, go,&rdquo; said she to the Duke. &ldquo;You dismissed me; now I dismiss
      you. We are quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a gesture on Cataneo&rsquo;s part, as he seemed inclined to dispute this
      order, which was given with an action worthy of Semiramis,&mdash;the part
      in which la Tinti had won her fame,&mdash;the prima donna flew at the old
      ape and put him out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not leave me in quiet this evening, we never meet again. And my
      <i>never</i> counts for more than yours,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; retorted the Duke, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;Dear idol, it strikes me
      that I am leaving you <i>agitata</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mean spirit was no surprise to Emilio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man who has accustomed himself to some particular taste, chosen from
      among the various effects of love, in harmony with his own nature, knows
      that no consideration can stop a man who has allowed his passions to
      become a habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarina bounded like a fawn from the door to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prince, and poor, young, and handsome!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Why, it is a fairy
      tale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sicilian perched herself on the bed with the artless freedom of an
      animal, the yearning of a plant for the sun, the airy motion of a branch
      waltzing to the breeze. As she unbuttoned the wristbands of her sleeves,
      she began to sing, not in the pitch that won her the applause of an
      audience at the <i>Fenice</i>, but in a warble tender with emotion. Her
      song was a zephyr carrying the caresses of her love to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole a glance at Emilio, who was as much embarrassed as she; for this
      woman of the stage had lost all the boldness that had sparkled in her eyes
      and given decision to her voice and gestures when she dismissed the Duke.
      She was as humble as a courtesan who has fallen in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      To picture la Tinti you must recall one of our best French singers when
      she came out in <i>Il Fazzoletto</i>, an opera by Garcia that was then
      being played by an Italian company at the theatre in the Rue Lauvois. She
      was so beautiful that a Naples guardsman, having failed to win a hearing,
      killed himself in despair. The prima donna of the <i>Fenice</i> had the
      same refinement of features, the same elegant figure, and was equally
      young; but she had in addition the warm blood of Sicily that gave a glow
      to her loveliness. Her voice was fuller and richer, and she had that air
      of native majesty that is characteristic of Italian women.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Tinti&mdash;whose name also resembled that which the French singer
      assumed&mdash;was now seventeen, and the poor Prince three-and-twenty.
      What mocking hand had thought it sport to bring the match so near the
      powder? A fragrant room hung with rose-colored silk and brilliant with wax
      lights, a bed dressed in lace, a silent palace, and Venice! Two young and
      beautiful creatures! every ravishment at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio snatched up his trousers, jumped out of bed, escaped into the
      dressing-room, put on his clothes, came back and hurried to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were his thoughts while dressing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massimilla, beloved daughter of the Doni, in whom Italian beauty is an
      hereditary prerogative, you who are worthy of the portrait of <i>Margherita</i>,
      one of the few canvases painted entirely by Raphael to his glory! My
      beautiful and saintly mistress, shall I not have deserved you if I fly
      from this abyss of flowers? Should I be worthy of you if I profaned a
      heart that is wholly yours? No; I will not fall into the vulgar snare laid
      for me by my rebellious senses! This girl has her Duke, mine be my
      Duchess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he lifted the curtain, he heard a moan. The heroic lover looked round
      and saw Clarina on her knees, her face hidden in the bed, choking with
      sobs. Is it to be believed? The singer was lovelier kneeling thus, her
      face invisible, than even in her confusion with a glowing countenance. Her
      hair, which had fallen over her shoulders, her Magdalen-like attitude, the
      disorder of her half-unfastened dress,&mdash;the whole picture had been
      composed by the devil, who, as is well known, is a fine colorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince put his arm round the weeping girl, who slipped from him like a
      snake, and clung to one foot, pressing it to her beautiful bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you explain to me,&rdquo; said he, shaking his foot to free it from her
      embrace, &ldquo;how you happen to be in my palazzo? How the impoverished Emilio
      Memmi&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilio Memmi!&rdquo; cried Tinti, rising. &ldquo;You said you were a Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Prince since yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love with the Duchess Cataneo!&rdquo; said she, looking at him from
      head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio stood mute, seeing that the prima dona was smiling at him through
      her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Highness does not know that the man who had me trained for the stage&mdash;that
      the Duke&mdash;is Cataneo himself. And your friend Vendramini, thinking to
      do you a service, let him this palace for a thousand crowns, for the
      period of my season at the <i>Fenice</i>. Dear idol of my heart!&rdquo; she went
      on, taking his hand and drawing him towards her, &ldquo;why do you fly from one
      for whom many a man would run the risk of broken bones? Love, you see, is
      always love. It is the same everywhere; it is the sun of our souls; we can
      warm ourselves whenever it shines, and here&mdash;now&mdash;it is full
      noonday. If to-morrow you are not satisfied, kill me! But I shall survive,
      for I am a real beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilio decided on remaining. When he signified his consent by a nod the
      impulse of delight that sent a shiver through Clarina seemed to him like a
      light from hell. Love had never before appeared to him in so impressive a
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Carmagnola whistled loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he want of me?&rdquo; said the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      But bewildered by love, Emilio paid no heed to the gondolier&rsquo;s repeated
      signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have never traveled in Switzerland you may perhaps read this
      description with pleasure; and if you have clambered among those mountains
      you will not be sorry to be reminded of the scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that sublime land, in the heart of a mass of rock riven by a gorge,&mdash;a
      valley as wide as the Avenue de Neuilly in Paris, but a hundred fathoms
      deep and broken into ravines,&mdash;flows a torrent coming from some
      tremendous height of the Saint-Gothard on the Simplon, which has formed a
      pool, I know not how many yards deep or how many feet long and wide,
      hemmed in by splintered cliffs of granite on which meadows find a place,
      with fir-trees between them, and enormous elms, and where violets also
      grow, and strawberries. Here and there stands a chalet and at the window
      you may see the rosy face of a yellow-haired Swiss girl. According to the
      moods of the sky the water in this tarn is blue and green, but as a
      sapphire is blue, as an emerald is green. Well, nothing in the world can
      give such an idea of depth, peace, immensity, heavenly love, and eternal
      happiness&mdash;to the most heedless traveler, the most hurried courier,
      the most commonplace tradesman&mdash;as this liquid diamond into which the
      snow, gathering from the highest Alps, trickles through a natural channel
      hidden under the trees and eaten through the rock, escaping below through
      a gap without a sound. The watery sheet overhanging the fall glides so
      gently that no ripple is to be seen on the surface which mirrors the
      chaise as you drive past. The postboy smacks his whip; you turn past a
      crag; you cross a bridge: suddenly there is a terrific uproar of cascades
      tumbling together one upon another. The water, taking a mighty leap, is
      broken into a hundred falls, dashed to spray on the boulders; it sparkles
      in a myriad jets against a mass that has fallen from the heights that
      tower over the ravine exactly in the middle of the road that has been so
      irresistibly cut by the most formidable of active forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have formed a clear idea of this landscape, you will see in those
      sleeping waters the image of Emilio&rsquo;s love for the Duchess, and in the
      cascades leaping like a flock of sheep, an idea of his passion shared with
      la Tinti. In the midst of his torrent of love a rock stood up against
      which the torrent broke. The Prince, like Sisyphus, was constantly under
      the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth does the Duke do with a violin?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Do I owe
      this symphony to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked Clara Tinti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo;&mdash;for she saw that Emilio was but a child,&mdash;&ldquo;dear
      child,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that man, who is a hundred and eighteen in the parish
      register of vice, and only forty-seven in the register of the Church, has
      but one single joy left to him in life. Yes, everything is broken,
      everything in him is ruin or rags; his soul, intellect, heart, nerves,&mdash;everything
      in man that can supply an impulse and remind him of heaven, either by
      desire or enjoyment, is bound up with music, or rather with one of the
      many effects produced by music, the perfect unison of two voices, or of a
      voice with the top string of his violin. The old ape sits on my knee,
      takes his instrument,&mdash;he plays fairly well,&mdash;he produces the
      notes, and I try to imitate them. Then, when the long-sought-for moment
      comes when it is impossible to distinguish in the body of sound which is
      the note on the violin and which proceeds from my throat, the old man
      falls into an ecstasy, his dim eyes light up with their last remaining
      fires, he is quite happy and will roll on the floor like a drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why he pays Genovese such a price. Genovese is the only tenor
      whose voice occasionally sounds in unison with mine. Either we really do
      sing exactly together once or twice in an evening, or the Duke imagines
      that we do; and for that imaginary pleasure he has bought Genovese.
      Genovese belongs to him. No theatrical manager can engage that tenor
      without me, nor have me to sing without him. The Duke brought me up on
      purpose to gratify that whim; to him I owe my talent, my beauty,&mdash;my
      fortune, no doubt. He will die of an attack of perfect unison. The sense
      of hearing alone has survived the wreck of his faculties; that is the only
      thread by which he holds on to life. A vigorous shoot springs from that
      rotten stump. There are, I am told, many men in the same predicament. May
      Madonna preserve them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not come to that! You can do all you want&mdash;all I want of
      you, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards morning the Prince stole away and found Carmagnola lying asleep
      across the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altezza,&rdquo; said the gondolier, &ldquo;the Duchess ordered me to give you this
      note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out a dainty sheet of paper folded into a triangle. The Prince
      felt dizzy; he went back into the room and dropped into a chair, for his
      sight was dim, and his hands shook as he read:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;DEAR EMILIO:&mdash;Your gondola stopped at your palazzo. Did you not
  know that Cataneo has taken it for la Tinti? If you love me, go
  to-night to Vendramin, who tells me he has a room ready for you in
  his house. What shall I do? Can I remain in Venice to see my
  husband and his opera singer? Shall we go back together to Friuli?
  Write me one word, if only to tell me what the letter was you
  tossed into the lagoon.

                                              &ldquo;MASSIMILLA DONI.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The writing and the scent of the paper brought a thousand memories back to
      the young Venetian&rsquo;s mind. The sun of a single-minded passion threw its
      radiance on the blue depths come from so far, collected in a bottomless
      pool, and shining like a star. The noble youth could not restrain the
      tears that flowed freely from his eyes, for in the languid state produced
      by satiated senses he was disarmed by the thought of that purer divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in her sleep Clarina heard his weeping; she sat up in bed, saw her
      Prince in a dejected attitude, and threw herself at his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are still waiting for the answer,&rdquo; said Carmagnola, putting the
      curtain aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch, you have undone me!&rdquo; cried Emilio, starting up and spurning
      Clarina with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clutched it so lovingly, her look imploring some explanation,&mdash;the
      look of a tear-stained Samaritan,&mdash;that Emilio, enraged to find
      himself still in the toils of the passion that had wrought his fall,
      pushed away the singer with an unmanly kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me to kill you,&mdash;then die, venomous reptile!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the palace, and sprang into his gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull,&rdquo; said he to Carmagnola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gondolier divined his master&rsquo;s wishes, and by many windings brought
      him at last into the Canareggio, to the door of a wonderful palazzo, which
      you will admire when you see Venice, for no traveler ever fails to stop in
      front of those windows, each of a different design, vying with each other
      in fantastic ornament, with balconies like lace-work; to study the corners
      finishing in tall and slender twisted columns, the string-courses wrought
      by so inventive a chisel that no two shapes are alike in the arabesques on
      the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      How charming is that doorway! how mysterious the vaulted arcade leading to
      the stairs! Who could fail to admire the steps on which ingenious art has
      laid a carpet that will last while Venice stands,&mdash;a carpet as rich
      as if wrought in Turkey, but composed of marbles in endless variety of
      shapes, inlaid in white marble. You will delight in the charming ornament
      of the colonnades of the upper story,&mdash;gilt like those of a ducal
      palace,&mdash;so that the marvels of art are both under your feet and
      above your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      What delicate shadows! How silent, how cool! But how solemn, too, was that
      old palace! where, to delight Emilio and his friend Vendramin, the Duchess
      had collected antique Venetian furniture, and employed skilled hands to
      restore the ceilings. There, old Venice lived again. The splendor was not
      merely noble, it was instructive. The archaeologist would have found there
      such models of perfection as the middle ages produced, having taken
      example from Venice. Here were to be seen the original ceilings of
      woodwork covered with scrolls and flowers in gold on a colored ground, or
      in colors on gold, and ceilings of gilt plaster castings, with a picture
      of many figures in each corner, with a splendid fresco in the centre,&mdash;a
      style so costly that there are not two in the Louvre, and that the
      extravagance of Louis XIV. shrunk from such expense at Versailles. On all
      sides marble, wood, and silk had served as materials for exquisite
      workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilio pushed open a carved oak door, made his way down the long, vaulted
      passage which runs from end to end on each floor of a Venetian palazzo,
      and stopped before another door, so familiar that it made his heart beat.
      On seeing him, a lady companion came out of a vast drawing-room, and
      admitted him to a study where he found the Duchess on her knees in front
      of a Madonna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to confess and ask forgiveness. Massimilla, in prayer, had
      converted him. He and God; nothing else dwelt in that heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess rose very unaffectedly, and held out her hand. Her lover did
      not take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not Gianbattista see you, yesterday?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That piece of ill-luck gave me a night of misery. I was so afraid lest
      you might meet the Duke, whose perversity I know too well. What made
      Vendramin let your palace to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a good idea, Milla, for your Prince is poor enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla was so beautiful in her trust of him, and so wonderfully
      lovely, so happy in Emilio&rsquo;s presence, that at this moment the Prince,
      wide awake, experienced the sensations of the horrible dream that torments
      persons of a lively imagination, in which after arriving in a ballroom
      full of women in full dress, the dreamer is suddenly aware that he is
      naked, without even a shirt; shame and terror possess him by turns, and
      only waking can relieve him from his misery. Thus stood Emilio&rsquo;s soul in
      the presence of his mistress. Hitherto that soul had known only the
      fairest flowers of feeling; a debauch had plunged it into dishonor. This
      none knew but he, for the beautiful Florentine ascribed so many virtues to
      her lover that the man she adored could not but be incapable of any stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Emilio had not taken her hand, the Duchess pushed her fingers through
      his hair that the singer had kissed. Then she perceived that Emilio&rsquo;s hand
      was clammy and his brow moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; she asked, in a voice to which tenderness gave the
      sweetness of a flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never till this moment have I known how much I love you,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear idol, what would you have?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done to make her ask that?&rdquo; he wondered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emilio, what letter was that which you threw into the lagoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vendramini&rsquo;s. I had not read it to the end, or I should never have gone
      to my palazzo, and there have met the Duke; for no doubt it told me all
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla turned pale, but a caress from Emilio reassured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay with me all day; we will go to the opera together. We will not set
      out for Friuli; your presence will no doubt enable me to endure
      Cataneo&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Massimilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this would be torment to her lover&rsquo;s soul, he consented with
      apparent joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything can give us a foretaste of what the damned will suffer on
      finding themselves so unworthy of God, is it not the state of a young man,
      as yet unpolluted, in the presence of a mistress he reveres, while he
      still feels on his lips the taste of infidelity, and brings into the
      sanctuary of the divinity he worships the tainted atmosphere of the
      courtesan?
    </p>
    <p>
      Baader, who in his lectures eliminated things divine by erotic imagery,
      had no doubt observed, like some Catholic writers, the intimate
      resemblance between human and heavenly love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This distress of mind cast a hue of melancholy over the pleasure the young
      Venetian felt in his mistress&rsquo; presence. A woman&rsquo;s instinct has amazing
      aptitude for harmony of feeling; it assumes the hue, it vibrates to the
      note suggested by her lover. The pungent flavor of coquettish spice is far
      indeed from spurring affection so much as this gentle sympathy of
      tenderness. The smartness of a coquette too clearly marks opposition;
      however transient it is displeasing; but this intimate comprehension shows
      a perfect fusion of souls. The hapless Emilio was touched by the unspoken
      divination which led the Duchess to pity a fault unknown to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla, feeling that her strength lay in the absence of any sensual
      side to her love, could allow herself to be expansive; she boldly and
      confidently poured out her angelic spirit, she stripped it bare, just as
      during that diabolical night, La Tinti had displayed the soft lines of her
      body, and her firm, elastic flesh. In Emilio&rsquo;s eyes there was as it were a
      conflict between the saintly love of this white soul and that of the
      vehement and muscular Sicilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was spent in long looks following on deep meditations. Each of
      them gauged the depths of tender feeling, and found it bottomless; a
      conviction that brought fond words to their lips. Modesty, the goddess who
      in a moment of forgetfulness with Love, was the mother of Coquettishness,
      need not have put her hand before her face as she looked at these lovers.
      As a crowning joy, an orgy of happiness, Massimilla pillowed Emilio&rsquo;s head
      in her arms, and now and then ventured to press her lips to his; but only
      as a bird dips its beak into the clear waters of a spring, looking round
      lest it should be seen. Their fancy worked upon this kiss, as a composer
      develops a subject by the endless resources of music, and it produced in
      them such tumultuous and vibrating echoes as fevered their blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Idea must always be stronger than the Fact, otherwise desire would be
      less perfect than satisfaction, and it is in fact the stronger,&mdash;it
      gives birth to wit. And, indeed, they were perfectly happy; for enjoyment
      must always take something off happiness. Married in heaven alone, these
      two lovers admired each other in their purest aspect,&mdash;that of two
      souls incandescent, and united in celestial light, radiant to the eyes
      that faith has touched; and, above all, filled with the rapture which the
      brush of a Raphael, a Titian, a Murillo, has depicted, and which those who
      have ever known it, taste again as they gaze at those paintings. Do not
      such peerless spirits scorn the coarser joys lavished by the Sicilian
      singer&mdash;the material expression of that angelic union?
    </p>
    <p>
      These noble thoughts were in the Prince&rsquo;s mind as he reposed in heavenly
      calm on Massimilla&rsquo;s cool, soft, white bosom, under the gentle radiance of
      her eyes veiled by long, bright lashes; and he gave himself up to this
      dream of an ideal orgy. At such a moment, Massimilla was as one of the
      Virgin visions seen in dreams, which vanish at cock-crow, but whom we
      recognize when we find them again in their realm of glory,&mdash;in the
      works of some great painters of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the lovers went to the theatre. This is the way of Italian
      life: love in the morning; music in the evening; the night for sleep. How
      far preferable is this existence to that of a country where every one
      expends his lungs and strength in politics, without contributing any more,
      single-minded, to the progress of affairs than a grain of sand can make a
      cloud of dust. Liberty, in those strange lands, consists in the right to
      squabble over public concerns, to take care of oneself, to waste time in
      patriotic undertakings each more futile than the last, inasmuch as they
      all weaken that noble, holy self-concern which is the parent of all great
      human achievement. At Venice, on the contrary, love and its myriad ties,
      the sweet business of real happiness, fills up all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that country, love is so much a matter of course that the Duchess was
      regarded as a wonder; for, in spite of her violent attachment to Emilio,
      everybody was confident of her immaculate purity. And women gave their
      sincere pity to the poor young man, who was regarded as a victim to the
      virtue of his lady-love. At the same time, no one cared to blame the
      Duchess, for in Italy religion is a power as much respected as love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening after evening Massimilla&rsquo;s box was the first object of every
      opera-glass, and each woman would say to her lover, as she studied the
      Duchess and her adorer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far have they got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lover would examine Emilio, seeking some evidence of success; would
      find no expression but that of a pure and dejected passion. And throughout
      the house, as they visited from box to box, the men would say to the
      ladies:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Cataneo is not yet Emilio&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is unwise,&rdquo; said the old women. &ldquo;She will tire him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Forse!</i>&rdquo; (Perhaps) the young wives would reply, with the solemn
      accent that Italians can infuse into that great word&mdash;the answer to
      many questions here below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some women were indignant, thought the whole thing ill-judged, and
      declared that it was a misapprehension of religion to allow it to smother
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, love that poor Emilio,&rdquo; said the Signora Vulpato to Massimilla,
      as they met on the stairs in going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love him with all my might,&rdquo; replied the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does not he look happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla&rsquo;s reply was a little shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      We in France&mdash;France as the growing mania for English proprieties has
      made it&mdash;can form no idea of the serious interest taken in this
      affair by Venetian society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vendramini alone knew Emilio&rsquo;s secret, which was carefully kept between
      two men who had, for private pleasure, combined their coats of arms with
      the motto <i>Non amici, frates</i>.

      The opening night of the opera season is an event at Venice, as in every
      capital in Italy. The <i>Fenice</i> was crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five hours of the night that are spent at the theatre fill so
      important a place in Italian life that it is well to give an account of
      the customs that have risen from this manner of spending time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boxes in Italy are unlike those of any other country, inasmuch as that
      elsewhere the women go to be seen, and that Italian ladies do not care to
      make a show of themselves. Each box is long and narrow, sloping at an
      angle to the front and to the passage behind. On each side is a sofa, and
      at the end stand two armchairs, one for the mistress of the box, and the
      other for a lady friend when she brings one, which she rarely does. Each
      lady is in fact too much engaged in her own box to call on others, or to
      wish to see them; also no one cares to introduce a rival. An Italian woman
      almost always reigns alone in her box; the mothers are not the slaves of
      their daughters, the daughters have no mother on their hands; thus there
      are no children, no relations to watch and censure and bore, or cut into a
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front every box is draped in the same way, with the same silk: from the
      cornice hang curtains, also all to match; and these remain drawn when the
      family to whom the box belongs is in mourning. With very few exceptions,
      and those only at Milan, there is no light inside the box; they are
      illuminated only from the stage, and from a not very brilliant hanging
      lustre which, in spite of protests, has been introduced into the house in
      some towns; still, screened by the curtains, they are never very light,
      and their arrangement leaves the back of the box so dark that it is very
      difficult to see what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boxes, large enough to accommodate eight or ten persons, are decorated
      with handsome silks, the ceilings are painted and ornamented in light and
      pleasing colors; the woodwork is gilt. Ices and sorbets are served there,
      and sweetmeats; for only the plebeian classes ever have a serious meal.
      Each box is freehold property, and of considerable value; some are
      estimated at as much as thirty thousand lire; the Litta family at Milan
      own three adjoining. These facts sufficiently indicate the importance
      attributed to this incident of fashionable life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation reigns supreme in this little apartment, which Stendhal, one
      of the most ingenious of modern writers, and a keen student of Italian
      manners, has called a boudoir with a window opening on to a pit. The music
      and the spectacle are in fact purely accessory; the real interest of the
      evening is in the social meeting there, the all-important trivialities of
      love that are discussed, the assignations held, the anecdotes and gossip
      that creep in. The theatre is an inexpensive meeting-place for a whole
      society which is content and amused with studying itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who are admitted take their seats on one of the sofas, in the
      order of their arrival. The first comer naturally is next to the mistress
      of the box, but when both seats are full, if another visitor comes in, the
      one who has sat longest rises, takes his leave and departs. All move up
      one place, and so each in turn is next the sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      This futile gossip, or serious colloquy, these elegant trivialities of
      Italian life, inevitably imply some general intimacy. The lady may be in
      full dress or not, as she pleases. She is so completely at home that a
      stranger who has been received in her box may call on her next day at her
      residence. The foreign visitor cannot at first understand this life of
      idle wit, this <i>dolce far niente</i> on a background of music. Only long
      custom and keen observation can ever reveal to a foreigner the meaning of
      Italian life, which is like the free sky of the south, and where a rich
      man will not endure a cloud. A man of rank cares little about the
      management of his fortune; he leaves the details to his stewards
      (ragionati), who rob and ruin him. He has no instinct for politics, and
      they would presently bore him; he lives exclusively for passion, which
      fills up all his time; hence the necessity felt by the lady and her lover
      for being constantly together; for the great feature of such a life is the
      lover, who for five hours is kept under the eye of a woman who has had him
      at her feet all day. Thus Italian habits allow of perpetual satisfaction,
      and necessitate a constant study of the means fitted to insure it, though
      hidden under apparent light-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a beautiful life, but a reckless one, and in no country in the world
      are men so often found worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess&rsquo; box was on the pit tier&mdash;<i>pepiano</i>, as it is called
      in Venice; she always sat where the light from the stage fell on her face,
      so that her handsome head, softly illuminated, stood out against the dark
      background. The Florentine attracted every gaze by her broad, high brow,
      as white as snow, crowned with plaits of black hair that gave her a really
      royal look; by the refinement of her features, resembling the noble
      features of Andrea del Sarto&rsquo;s heads; by the outline of her face, the
      setting of her eyes; and by those velvet eyes themselves, which spoke of
      the rapture of a woman dreaming of happiness, still pure though loving, at
      once attractive and dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of <i>Mose</i>, in which la Tinti was to have appeared with
      Genovese, <i>Il Barbiere</i> was given, and the tenor was to sing without
      the celebrated prima donna. The manager announced that he had been obliged
      to change the opera in consequence of la Tinti&rsquo;s being ill; and the Duke
      was not to be seen in the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this a clever trick on the part of the management, to secure two full
      houses by bringing out Genovese and Tinti separately, or was Clarina&rsquo;s
      indisposition genuine? While this was open to discussion by others, Emilio
      might be better informed; and though the announcement caused him some
      remorse, as he remembered the singer&rsquo;s beauty and vehemence, her absence
      and the Duke&rsquo;s put both the Prince and the Duchess very much at their
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Genovese sang in such a way as to drive out all memories of a night of
      illicit love, and to prolong the heavenly joys of this blissful day. Happy
      to be alone to receive the applause of the house, the tenor did his best
      with the powers which have since achieved European fame. Genovese, then
      but three-and-twenty, born at Bergamo, a pupil of Veluti&rsquo;s and devoted to
      his art, a fine man, good-looking, clever in apprehending the spirit of a
      part, was already developing into the great artist destined to win fame
      and fortune. He had a wild success,&mdash;a phrase which is literally
      exact only in Italy, where the applause of the house is absolutely
      frenzied when a singer procures it enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Prince&rsquo;s friends came to congratulate him on coming into his
      title, and to discuss the news. Only last evening la Tinti, taken by the
      Duke to the Vulpatos&rsquo;, had sung there, apparently in health as sound as
      her voice was fine; hence her sudden disposition gave rise to much
      comment. It was rumored at the Cafe Florian that Genovese was desperately
      in love with Clarina; that she was only anxious to avoid his declarations,
      and that the manager had tried in vain to induce her to appear with him.
      The Austrian General, on the other hand, asserted that it was the Duke who
      was ill, that the prima donna was nursing him, and that Genovese had been
      commanded to make amends to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess owed this visit from the Austrian General to the fact that a
      French physician had come to Venice whom the General wished to introduce
      to her. The Prince, seeing Vendramin wandering about the <i>parterre</i>,
      went out for a few minutes of confidential talk with his friend, whom he
      had not seen for three months; and as they walked round the gangway which
      divides the seats in the pit from the lowest tier of boxes, he had an
      opportunity of observing Massimilla&rsquo;s reception of the foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that Frenchman?&rdquo; asked the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A physician sent for by Cataneo, who wants to know how long he is likely
      to live,&rdquo; said Vendramin. &ldquo;The Frenchman is waiting for Malfatti, with
      whom he is to hold a consultation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like every Italian woman who is in love, the Duchess kept her eyes fixed
      on Emilio; for in that land a woman is so wholly wrapped up in her lover
      that it is difficult to detect an expressive glance directed at anybody
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caro,&rdquo; said the Prince to his friend, &ldquo;remember I slept at your house
      last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you triumphed?&rdquo; said Vendramin, putting his arm round Emilio&rsquo;s
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I hope I may some day be happy with Massimilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Marco, &ldquo;then you will be the most envied man on earth. The
      Duchess is the most perfect woman in Italy. To me, seeing things as I do
      through the dazzling medium of opium, she seems the very highest
      expression of art; for nature, without knowing it, has made her a Raphael
      picture. Your passion gives no umbrage to Cataneo, who has handed over to
      me a thousand crowns, which I am to give to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; added Emilio, &ldquo;whatever you may hear said, I sleep every night at
      your house. Come, for every minute spent away from her, when I might be
      with her, is torment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilio took his seat at the back of the box and remained there in silence,
      listening to the Duchess, enchanted by her wit and beauty. It was for him,
      and not out of vanity, that Massimilla lavished the charms of her
      conversation bright with Italian wit, in which sarcasm lashed things but
      not persons, laughter attacked nothing that was not laughable, mere
      trifles were seasoned with Attic salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anywhere else she might have been tiresome. The Italians, an eminently
      intelligent race, have no fancy for displaying their talents where they
      are not in demand; their chat is perfectly simple and effortless, it never
      makes play, as in France, under the lead of a fencing master, each one
      flourishing his foil, or, if he has nothing to say, sitting humiliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation sparkles with a delicate and subtle satire that plays
      gracefully with familiar facts; and instead of a compromising epigram an
      Italian has a glance or a smile of unutterable meaning. They think&mdash;and
      they are right&mdash;that to be expected to understand ideas when they
      only seek enjoyment, is a bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, la Vulpato had said to Massimilla:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you loved him you would not talk so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilio took no part in the conversation; he listened and gazed. This
      reserve might have led foreigners to suppose that the Prince was a man of
      no intelligence,&mdash;their impression very commonly of an Italian in
      love,&mdash;whereas he was simply a lover up to his ears in rapture.
      Vendramin sat down by Emilio, opposite the Frenchman, who, as the
      stranger, occupied the corner facing the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that gentleman drunk?&rdquo; said the physician in an undertone to
      Massimilla, after looking at Vendramin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that land of passion, each passion bears its excuse in itself, and
      gracious indulgence is shown to every form of error. The Duchess sighed
      deeply, and an expression of suppressed pain passed over her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see strange things in our country, monsieur,&rdquo; she went on.
      &ldquo;Vendramin lives on opium, as this one lives on love, and that one buries
      himself in learning; most young men have a passion for a dancer, as older
      men are miserly. We all create some happiness or some madness for
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you all want to divert your minds from some fixed idea, for which
      a revolution would be a radical cure,&rdquo; replied the physician. &ldquo;The Genoese
      regrets his republic, the Milanese pines for his independence, the
      Piemontese longs for a constitutional government, the Romagna cries for
      liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which it knows nothing,&rdquo; interrupted the Duchess. &ldquo;Alas! there are men
      in Italy so stupid as to long for your idiotic Charter, which destroys the
      influence of woman. Most of my fellow-countrywomen must need read your
      French books&mdash;useless rhodomontade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useless!&rdquo; cried the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, monsieur,&rdquo; the Duchess went on, &ldquo;what can you find in a book that is
      better than what we have in our hearts? Italy is mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that a people is mad because it wishes to be its own
      master,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duchess, eagerly, &ldquo;does not that mean paying
      with a great deal of bloodshed for the right of quarreling, as you do,
      over crazy ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you approve of despotism?&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not approve of a system of government which, by depriving us
      of books and odious politics, leaves men entirely to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought that the Italians were more patriotic,&rdquo; said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla laughed so slyly that her interlocutor could not distinguish
      mockery from serious meaning, nor her real opinion from ironical
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not a liberal?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven preserve me!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I can imagine nothing in worse taste than
      such opinions in a woman. Could you love a woman whose heart was occupied
      by all mankind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who love are naturally aristocrats,&rdquo; the Austrian General observed,
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I came into the theatre,&rdquo; the Frenchman observed, &ldquo;you were the first
      person I saw; and I remarked to his Excellency that if there was a woman
      who could personify a nation it was you. But I grieve to discover that,
      though you represent its divine beauty, you have not the constitutional
      spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not bound,&rdquo; said the Duchess, pointing to the ballet now being
      danced, &ldquo;to find all our dancers detestable and our singers atrocious?
      Paris and London rob us of all our leading stars. Paris passes judgment on
      them, and London pays them. Genovese and la Tinti will not be left to us
      for six months&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, the Austrian left the box. Vendramin, the Prince, and
      the other two Italians exchanged a look and a smile, glancing at the
      French physician. He, for a moment, felt doubtful of himself,&mdash;a rare
      thing in a Frenchman,&mdash;fancying he had said or done something
      incongruous; but the riddle was immediately solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you thing it would be judicious,&rdquo; said Emilio, &ldquo;if we spoke our mind
      in the presence of our masters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in a land of slaves,&rdquo; said the Duchess, in a tone and with a
      droop of the head which gave her at once the look for which the physician
      had sought in vain. &ldquo;Vendramin,&rdquo; she went on, speaking so that only the
      stranger could hear her, &ldquo;took to smoking opium, a villainous idea
      suggested to him by an Englishman who, for other reasons of his, craved an
      easy death&mdash;not death as men see it in the form of a skeleton, but
      death draped with the frippery you in France call a flag&mdash;a maiden
      form crowned with flowers or laurels; she appears in a cloud of gunpowder
      borne on the flight of a cannon-ball&mdash;or else stretched on a bed
      between two courtesans; or again, she rises in the steam of a bowl of
      punch, or the dazzling vapor of a diamond&mdash;but a diamond in the form
      of carbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever Vendramin chooses, for three Austrian lire, he can be a Venetian
      Captain, he can sail in the galleys of the Republic, and conquer the
      gilded domes of Constantinople. Then he can lounge on the divans in the
      Seraglio among the Sultan&rsquo;s wives, while the Grand Signor himself is the
      slave of the Venetian conqueror. He returns to restore his palazzo with
      the spoils of the Ottoman Empire. He can quit the women of the East for
      the doubly masked intrigues of his beloved Venetians, and fancy that he
      dreads the jealousy which has ceased to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three zwanziger he can transport himself into the Council of Ten, can
      wield there terrible power, and leave the Doges&rsquo; Palace to sleep under the
      watch of a pair of flashing eyes, or to climb a balcony from which a fair
      hand has hung a silken ladder. He can love a woman to whom opium lends
      such poetic grace as we women of flesh and blood could never show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently he turns over, and he is face to face with the dreadful frown
      of the senator, who holds a dagger. He hears the blade plunged into his
      mistress&rsquo; heart. She dies smiling on him; for she has saved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is a happy woman!&rdquo; added the Duchess, looking at Emilio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He escapes and flies to command the Dalmatians, to conquer the Illyrian
      coast for his beloved Venice. His glory wins him forgiveness, and he
      enjoys a life of domestic happiness,&mdash;a home, a winter evening, a
      young wife and charming children, who pray to San Marco under the care of
      an old nurse. Yes, for three francs&rsquo; worth of opium he furnishes our empty
      arsenal, he watches convoys of merchandise coming in, going to the four
      quarters of the world. The forces of modern industry no longer reign in
      London, but in his own Venice, where the hanging gardens of Semiramis, the
      Temple of Jerusalem, the marvels of Rome, live once more. He adds to the
      glories of the middle ages by the labors of steam, by new masterpieces of
      art under the protection of Venice, who protected it of old. Monuments and
      nations crowd into his little brain; there is room for them all. Empires
      and cities and revolutions come and vanish in the course of a few hours,
      while Venice alone expands and lives; for the Venice of his dreams is the
      empress of the seas. She has two millions of inhabitants, the sceptre of
      Italy, the mastery of the Mediterranean and the Indies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an opera is the brain of man! What an unfathomed abyss!&mdash;even
      to those who, like Gall, have mapped it out,&rdquo; cried the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Duchess,&rdquo; said Vendramin, &ldquo;do not omit the last service that my
      elixir will do me. After hearing ravishing voices and imbibing music
      through every pore, after experiencing the keenest pleasures and the
      fiercest delights of Mahomet&rsquo;s paradise, I see none but the most terrible
      images. I have visions of my beloved Venice full of children&rsquo;s faces,
      distorted, like those of the dying; of women covered with dreadful wounds,
      torn and wailing; of men mangled and crushed by the copper sides of
      crashing vessels. I begin to see Venice as she is, shrouded in crape,
      stripped, robbed, destitute. Pale phantoms wander through her streets!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already the Austrian soldiers are grinning over me, already my visionary
      life is drifting into real life; whereas six months ago real life was the
      bad dream, and the life of opium held love and bliss, important affairs
      and political interests. Alas! To my grief, I see the dawn over my tomb,
      where truth and falsehood mingle in a dubious light, which is neither day
      nor darkness, but partakes of both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see that in this head there is too much patriotism,&rdquo; said the
      Prince, laying his hand on the thick black curls that fell on Vendramin&rsquo;s
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if he loves us he will give up his dreadful opium!&rdquo; said Massimilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cure your friend,&rdquo; said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Achieve that, and we shall love you,&rdquo; said the Duchess. &ldquo;But if on your
      return to France you do not calumniate us, we shall love you even better.
      The hapless Italians are too much crushed by foreign dominion to be fairly
      judged&mdash;for we have known yours,&rdquo; she added, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was more generous than Austria&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the physician, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Austria squeezes and gives us nothing back, and you squeeze to enlarge
      and beautify our towns; you stimulated us by giving us an army. You
      thought you could keep Italy, and they expect to lose it&mdash;there lies
      the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Austrians provide us with a sort of ease that is as stultifying and
      heavy as themselves, while you overwhelmed us by your devouring energy.
      But whether we die of tonics or of narcotics, what does it matter? It is
      death all the same, Monsieur le docteur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy Italy! In my eyes she is like a beautiful woman whom France ought
      to protect by making her his mistress,&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could not love us as we wish to be loved,&rdquo; said the Duchess,
      smiling. &ldquo;We want to be free. But the liberty I crave is not your ignoble
      and middle-class liberalism, which would kill all art. I ask,&rdquo; said she,
      in a tone that thrilled through the box,&mdash;&ldquo;that is to say, I would
      ask,&mdash;that each Italian republic should be resuscitated, with its
      nobles, its citizens, its special privileges for each caste. I would have
      the old aristocratic republics once more with their intestine warfare and
      rivalry that gave birth to the noblest works of art, that created
      politics, that raised up the great princely houses. By extending the
      action of one government over a vast expanse of country it is frittered
      down. The Italian republics were the glory of Europe in the middle ages.
      Why has Italy succumbed when the Swiss, who were her porters, have
      triumphed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Swiss republics,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;were worthy housewives, busy with
      their own little concerns, and neither having any cause for envying
      another. Your republics were haughty queens, preferring to sell themselves
      rather than bow to a neighbor; they fell too low ever to rise again. The
      Guelphs are triumphant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not pity us too much,&rdquo; said the Duchess, in a voice that made the two
      friends start. &ldquo;We are still supreme. Even in the depths of her misfortune
      Italy governs through the choicer spirits that abound in her cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately the greater number of her geniuses learn to understand life
      so quickly that they lie sunk in poverty-stricken pleasure. As for those
      who are willing to play the melancholy game for immortality, they know how
      to get at your gold and to secure your praises. Ay, in this land&mdash;pitied
      for its fallen state by traveled simpletons and hypocritical poets, while
      its character is traduced by politicians&mdash;in this land, which appears
      so languid, powerless, and ruinous, worn out rather than old, there are
      puissant brains in every branch of life, genius throwing out vigorous
      shoots as an old vine-stock throws out canes productive of delicious
      fruit. This race of ancient rulers still gives birth to kings&mdash;Lagrange,
      Volta, Rasori, Canova, Rossini, Bartolini, Galvani, Vigano, Beccaria,
      Cicognara, Corvetto. These Italians are masters of the scientific peaks on
      which they stand, or of the arts to which they devote themselves. To say
      nothing of the singers and executants who captivate Europe by their
      amazing perfections: Taglioni, Paganini, and the rest. Italy still rules
      the world which will always come to worship her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Florian&rsquo;s to-night; you will find in Capraja one of our cleverest
      men, but in love with obscurity. No one but the Duke, my master,
      understands music so thoroughly as he does; indeed he is known here as <i>il
      Fanatico</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After sitting a few minutes listening to the eager war of words between
      the physician and the Duchess, who showed much ingenious eloquence, the
      Italians, one by one, took leave, and went off to tell the news in every
      box, that la Cataneo, who was regarded as a woman of great wit and spirit,
      had, on the question of Italy, defeated a famous French doctor. This was
      the talk of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Frenchman found himself alone with the Duchess and the
      Prince, he understood that they were to be left together, and took leave.
      Massimilla bowed with a bend of the neck that placed him at such a
      distance that this salute might have secured her the man&rsquo;s hatred, if he
      could have ignored the charm of her eloquence and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus at the end of the opera, Emilio and Massimilla were alone, and
      holding hands they listened together to the duet that finishes <i>Il
      Barbiere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing but music to express love,&rdquo; said the Duchess, moved by
      that song as of two rapturous nightingales.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear twinkled in Emilio&rsquo;s eye; Massimilla, sublime in such beauty as
      beams in Raphael&rsquo;s Saint-Cecilia, pressed his hand, their knees touched,
      there was, as it seemed, the blossom of a kiss on her lips. The Prince saw
      on her blushing face a glow of joy like that which on a summer&rsquo;s day
      shines down on the golden harvest; his heart seemed bursting with the tide
      of blood that rushed to it. He fancied that he could hear an angelic
      chorus of voices, and he would have given his life to feel the fire of
      passion which at this hour last night had filled him for the odious
      Clarina; but he was at the moment hardly conscious of having a body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimilla, much distressed, ascribed this tear, in her guilelessness, to
      the remark she had made as to Genovese&rsquo;s cavatina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, <i>carino</i>,&rdquo; said she in Emilio&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;are not you as far better
      than every expression of love, as cause is superior to effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After handing the Duchess to her gondola, Emilio waited for Vendramin to
      go to Florian&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cafe Florian at Venice is a quite undefinable institution. Merchants
      transact their business there, and lawyers meet to talk over their most
      difficult cases. Florian&rsquo;s is at once an Exchange, a green-room, a
      newspaper office, a club, a confessional,&mdash;and it is so well adapted
      to the needs of the place that some Venetian women never know what their
      husband&rsquo;s business may be, for, if they have a letter to write, they go to
      write it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spies, of course, abound at Florian&rsquo;s; but their presence only sharpens
      Venetian wits, which may here exercise the discretion once so famous. A
      great many persons spend the whole day at Florian&rsquo;s; in fact, to some men
      Florian&rsquo;s is so much a matter of necessity, that between the acts of an
      opera they leave the ladies in their boxes and take a turn to hear what is
      going on there.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the two friends were walking in the narrow streets of the Merceria
      they did not speak, for there were too many people; but as they turned
      into the Piazzi di San Marco, the Prince said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go at once to the cafe. Let us walk about; I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He related his adventure with Clarina and explained his position. To
      Vendramin Emilio&rsquo;s despair seemed so nearly allied to madness that he
      promised to cure him completely if only he would give him <i>carte blanche</i>
      to deal with Massimilla. This ray of hope came just in time to save Emilio
      from drowning himself that night; for, indeed, as he remembered the
      singer, he felt a horrible wish to go back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends then went to an inner room at Florian&rsquo;s, where they
      listened to the conversation of some of the superior men of the town, who
      discoursed the subjects of the day. The most interesting of these were, in
      the first place, the eccentricities of Lord Byron, of whom the Venetians
      made great sport; then Cataneo&rsquo;s attachment for la Tinti, for which no
      reason could be assigned after twenty different causes had been suggested;
      then Genovese&rsquo;s debut; finally, the tilting match between the Duchess and
      the French doctor. Just as the discussion became vehemently musical, Duke
      Cataneo made his appearance. He bowed very courteously to Emilio, which
      seemed so natural that no one noticed it, and Emilio bowed gravely in
      return. Cataneo looked round to see if there was anybody he knew,
      recognized Vendramin and greeted him, bowed to his banker, a rich
      patrician, and finally to the man who happened to be speaking,&mdash;a
      celebrated musical fanatic, a friend of the Comtesse Albrizzi. Like some
      others who frequented Florian&rsquo;s, his mode of life was absolutely unknown,
      so carefully did he conceal it. Nothing was known about him but what he
      chose to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Capraja, the nobleman whom the Duchess had mentioned to the
      French doctor. This Venetian was one of a class of dreamers whose powerful
      minds divine everything. He was an eccentric theorist, and cared no more
      for celebrity than for a broken pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life was in accordance with his ideas. Capraja made his appearance at
      about ten every morning under the <i>Procuratie</i>, without anyone
      knowing whence he came. He lounged about Venice, smoking cigars. He
      regularly went to the Fenice, sitting in the pit-stalls, and between the
      acts went round to Florian&rsquo;s, where he took three or four cups of coffee a
      day; and he ended the evening at the cafe, never leaving it till about two
      in the morning. Twelve hundred francs a year paid all his expenses; he ate
      but one meal a day at an eating-house in the Merceria, where the cook had
      his dinner ready for him at a fixed hour, on a little table at the back of
      the shop; the pastry-cook&rsquo;s daughter herself prepared his stuffed oysters,
      provided him with cigars, and took care of his money. By his advice, this
      girl, though she was very handsome, would never countenance a lover, lived
      very steadily, and still wore the old Venetian costume. This purely-bred
      Venetian girl was twelve years old when Capraja first took an interest in
      her, and six-and-twenty when he died. She was very fond of him, though he
      had never even kissed her hand or her brow, and she knew nothing whatever
      of the poor old nobleman&rsquo;s intentions with regard to her. The girl had at
      last as complete control of the old gentleman as a mother has of her
      child; she would tell him when he wanted clean linen; next day he would
      come without a shirt, and she would give him a clean one to put on in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never looked at a woman either in the theatre or out walking. Though he
      was the descendant of an old patrician family he never thought his rank
      worth mentioning. But at night, after twelve, he awoke from his apathy,
      talked, and showed that he had seen and heard everything. This peaceful
      Diogenes, quite incapable of explaining his tenets, half a Turk, half a
      Venetian, was thick-set, short, and fat; he had a Doge&rsquo;s sharp nose, an
      inquisitive, satirical eye, and a discreet though smiling mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he died, it became known that he had lived in a little den near San
      Benedetto. He had two million francs invested in the funds of various
      countries of Europe, and had left the interest untouched ever since he had
      first bought the securities in 1814, so the sum was now enormous, alike
      from the increased value of the capital and the accumulated interest. All
      this money was left to the pastry-cook&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genovese,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;will do wonders. Whether he really understands
      the great end of music, or acts only on instinct, I know not; but he is
      the first singer who ever satisfied me. I shall not die without hearing a
      <i>cadenza</i> executed as I have heard them in my dreams, waking with a
      feeling as though the sounds were floating in the air. The clear <i>cadenza</i>
      is the highest achievement of art; it is the arabesque, decorating the
      finest room in the house; a shade too little and it is nothing, a touch
      too much and all is confusion. Its task is to awake in the soul a thousand
      dormant ideas; it flies up and sweeps through space, scattering seeds in
      the air to be taken in by our ears and blossom in our heart. Believe me,
      in painting his Saint-Cecilia, Raphael gave the preference to music over
      poetry. And he was right; music appeals to the heart, whereas writing is
      addressed to the intellect; it communicates ideas directly, like a
      perfume. The singer&rsquo;s voice impinges not on the mind, not on the memory of
      happiness, but on the first principle of thought; it stirs the elements of
      sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a grievous thing that the populace should have compelled musicians
      to adapt their expression to words, to factitious emotions; but then they
      were not otherwise intelligible to the vulgar. Thus the <i>cadenza</i> is
      the only thing left to the lovers of pure music, the devotees of
      unfettered art. To-night, as I listened to that last <i>cavatina</i>, I
      felt as if I were beckoned by a fair creature whose look alone had made me
      young again. The enchantress placed a crown on my brow, and led me to the
      ivory door through which we pass to the mysterious land of day-dreams. I
      owe it to Genovese that I escaped for a few minutes from this old husk&mdash;minutes,
      short no doubt by the clock, but very long by the record of sensation. For
      a brief spring-time, scented with roses, I was young again&mdash;and
      beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are mistaken, <i>caro</i> Capraja,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;There is in
      music an effect yet more magical than that of the <i>cadenza</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Capraja.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unison of two voices, or of a voice and a violin,&mdash;the
      instrument which has tones most nearly resembling those of the human
      voice,&rdquo; replied Cataneo. &ldquo;This perfect concord bears us on to the very
      heart of life, on the tide of elements which can resuscitate rapture and
      carry man up to the centre of the luminous sphere where his mind can
      command the whole universe. You still need a <i>thema</i>, Capraja, but
      the pure element is enough for me. You need that the current should flow
      through the myriad canals of the machine to fall in dazzling cascades,
      while I am content with the pure tranquil pool. My eye gazes across a lake
      without a ripple. I can embrace the infinite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak no more, Cataneo,&rdquo; said Capraja, haughtily. &ldquo;What! Do you fail to
      see the fairy, who, in her swift rush through the sparkling atmosphere,
      collects and binds with the golden thread of harmony, the gems of melody
      she smilingly sheds on us? Have you ever felt the touch of her wand, as
      she says to Curiosity, &lsquo;Awake!&rsquo; The divinity rises up radiant from the
      depths of the brain; she flies to her store of wonders and fingers them
      lightly as an organist touches the keys. Suddenly, up starts Memory,
      bringing us the roses of the past, divinely preserved and still fresh. The
      mistress of our youth revives, and strokes the young man&rsquo;s hair. Our
      heart, too full, overflows; we see the flowery banks of the torrent of
      love. Every burning bush we ever knew blazes afresh, and repeats the
      heavenly words we once heard and understood. The voice rolls on; it
      embraces in its rapid turns those fugitive horizons, and they shrink away;
      they vanish, eclipsed by newer and deeper joys&mdash;those of an
      unrevealed future, to which the fairy points as she returns to the blue
      heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; retorted Cataneo, &ldquo;have you never seen the direct ray of a star
      opening the vistas above; have you never mounted on that beam which guides
      you to the sky, to the heart of the first causes which move the worlds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To their hearers, the Duke and Capraja were playing a game of which the
      premises were unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genovese&rsquo;s voice thrills through every fibre,&rdquo; said Capraja.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And la Tinti&rsquo;s fires the blood,&rdquo; replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a paraphrase of happy love is that <i>cavatina</i>!&rdquo; Capraja went
      on. &ldquo;Ah! Rossini was young when he wrote that interpretation of
      effervescent ecstasy. My heart filled with renewed blood, a thousand
      cravings tingled in my veins. Never have sounds more angelic delivered me
      more completely from my earthly bonds! Never did the fairy wave more
      beautiful arms, smile more invitingly, lift her tunic more cunningly to
      display an ankle, raising the curtain that hides my other life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, my old friend,&rdquo; replied Cataneo, &ldquo;you shall ride on the back
      of a dazzling, white swan, who will show you the loveliest land there is;
      you shall see the spring-time as children see it. Your heart shall open to
      the radiance of a new sun; you shall sleep on crimson silk, under the gaze
      of a Madonna; you shall feel like a happy lover gently kissed by a nymph
      whose bare feet you still may see, but who is about to vanish. That swan
      will be the voice of Genovese, if he can unite it to its Leda, the voice
      of Clarina. To-morrow night we are to hear <i>Mose</i>, the grandest opera
      produced by Italy&rsquo;s greatest genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All present left the conversation to the Duke and Capraja, not wishing to
      be the victims of mystification. Only Vendramin and the French doctor
      listened to them for a few minutes. The opium-smoker understood these
      poetic flights; he had the key of the palace where those two sensuous
      imaginations were wandering. The doctor, too, tried to understand, and he
      understood, for he was one of the Pleiades of genius belonging to the
      Paris school of medicine, from which a true physician comes out as much a
      metaphysician as an accomplished analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand them?&rdquo; said Emilio to Vendramin as they left the cafe
      at two in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Vendramin, taking Emilio home with him. &ldquo;Those
      two men are of the legion of unearthly spirits to whom it is given here
      below to escape from the wrappings of the flesh, who can fly on the
      shoulders of the queen of witchcraft up to the blue empyrean where the
      sublime marvels are wrought of the intellectual life; they, by the power
      of art, can soar whither your immense love carries you, whither opium
      transports me. Then none can understand them but those who are like them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, who can inspire my soul by such base means, who can pack a hundred
      years of life into a single night, I can understand those lofty spirits
      when they talk of that glorious land, deemed a realm of chimeras by some
      who think themselves wise; but the realm of reality to us whom they think
      mad. Well, the Duke and Capraja, who were acquainted at Naples,&mdash;where
      Cataneo was born,&mdash;are mad about music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is that strange system that Capraja was eager to explain to the
      Duke? Did you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Vendramin. &ldquo;Capraja&rsquo;s great friend is a musician from
      Cremona, lodging in the Capello palace, who has a theory that sounds meet
      with an element in man, analogous to that which produces ideas. According
      to him, man has within him keys acted on by sound, and corresponding to
      his nerve-centres, where ideas and sensations take their rise. Capraja,
      who regards the arts as an assemblage of means by which he can harmonize,
      in himself, all external nature with another mysterious nature that he
      calls the inner life, shares all ideas of this instrument-maker, who at
      this moment is composing an opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceive of a sublime creation, wherein the marvels of the visible
      universe are reproduced with immeasurable grandeur, lightness, swiftness,
      and extension; wherein sensation is infinite, and whither certain
      privileged natures, possessed of divine powers, are able to penetrate, and
      you will have some notion of the ecstatic joys of which Cataneo and
      Capraja were speaking; both poets, each for himself alone. Only, in
      matters of the intellect, as soon as a man can rise above the sphere where
      plastic art is produced by a process of imitation, and enter into that
      transcendental sphere of abstractions where everything is understood as an
      elementary principle, and seen in the omnipotence of results, that man is
      no longer intelligible to ordinary minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have thus explained my love for Massimilla,&rdquo; said Emilio. &ldquo;There is
      in me, my friend, a force which awakes under the fire of her look, at her
      lightest touch, and wafts me to a world of light where effects are
      produced of which I dare not speak. It has seemed to me often that the
      delicate tissue of her skin has stamped flowers on mine as her hand lies
      on my hand. Her words play on those inner keys in me, of which you spoke.
      Desire excites my brain, stirring that invisible world, instead of
      exciting my passive flesh; the air seems red and sparkling, unknown
      perfumes of indescribable strength relax my sinews, roses wreathe my
      temples, and I feel as though my blood were escaping through opened
      arteries, so complete is my inanition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the effect on me of smoking opium,&rdquo; replied Vendramin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you wish to die?&rdquo; cried Emilio, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Venice!&rdquo; said Vendramin, waving his hand in the direction of San
      Marco. &ldquo;Can you see a single pinnacle or spire that stands straight? Do
      you not perceive that the sea is claiming its prey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince bent his head; he dared no more speak to his friend of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      To know what a free country means, you must have traveled in a conquered
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the Palazzo Vendramin, they saw a gondola moored at the
      water-gate. The Prince put his arm round Vendramin and clasped him
      affectionately, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night to you, my dear fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a woman? for me, whose only love is Venice?&rdquo; exclaimed Marco.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the gondolier, who was leaning against a column,
      recognizing the man he was to look out for, murmured in Emilio&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchess, monseigneur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emilio sprang into the gondola, where he was seized in a pair of soft arms&mdash;an
      embrace of iron&mdash;and dragged down on to the cushions, where he felt
      the heaving bosom of an ardent woman. And then he was no more Emilio, but
      Clarina&rsquo;s lover; for his ideas and feelings were so bewildering that he
      yielded as if stupefied by her first kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive this trick, my beloved,&rdquo; said the Sicilian. &ldquo;I shall die if you
      do not come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the gondola flew over the secret water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven on the following evening, the spectators were again in
      their places in the theatre, excepting that those in the pit always took
      their chances of where they might sit. Old Capraja was in Cataneo&rsquo;s box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the overture the Duke paid a call on the Duchess; he made a point
      of standing behind her and leaving the front seat to Emilio next the
      Duchess. He made a few trivial remarks, without sarcasm or bitterness, and
      with as polite a manner as if he were visiting a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of his efforts to seem amiable and natural, the Prince could
      not control his expression, which was deeply anxious. Bystanders would
      have ascribed such a change in his usually placid features to jealousy.
      The Duchess no doubt shared Emilio&rsquo;s feelings; she looked gloomy and was
      evidently depressed. The Duke, uncomfortable enough between two sulky
      people, took advantage of the French doctor&rsquo;s entrance to slip away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Cataneo to his physician before dropping the curtain over
      the entrance to the box, &ldquo;you will hear to-night a grand musical poem, not
      easy of comprehension at a first hearing. But in leaving you with the
      Duchess I know that you can have no more competent interpreter, for she is
      my pupil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, like the Duke, was struck by the expression stamped on the
      faces of the lovers, a look of pining despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then does an Italian opera need a guide to it?&rdquo; he asked Massimilla, with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recalled by this question to her duties as mistress of the box, the
      Duchess tried to chase away the clouds that darkened her brow, and
      replied, with eager haste, to open a conversation in which she might vent
      her irritation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not so much an opera, monsieur,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as an oratorio&mdash;a
      work which is in fact not unlike a most magnificent edifice, and I shall
      with pleasure be your guide. Believe me, it will not be too much to give
      all your mind to our great Rossini, for you need to be at once a poet and
      a musician to appreciate the whole bearing of such a work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You belong to a race whose language and genius are too practical for it
      to enter into music without an effort; but France is too intellectual not
      to learn to love it and cultivate it, and to succeed in that as in
      everything else. Also, it must be acknowledged that music, as created by
      Lulli, Rameau, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Cimarosa, Paisiello, and Rossini,
      and as it will be carried on by the great geniuses of the future, is a new
      art, unknown to former generations; they had indeed no such variety of
      instruments on which the flowers of melody now blossom as on some rich
      soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So novel an art demands study in the public, study of a kind that may
      develop the feelings to which music appeals. That sentiment hardly exists
      as yet among you&mdash;a nation given up to philosophical theories, to
      analysis and discussion, and always torn by civil disturbances. Modern
      music demands perfect peace; it is the language of loving and sentimental
      souls, inclined to lofty emotional aspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That language, a thousand times fuller than the language of words, is to
      speech and ideas what the thought is to its utterance; it arouses
      sensations and ideas in their primitive form, in that part of us where
      sensations and ideas have their birth, but leaves them as they are in each
      of us. That power over our inmost being is one of the grandest facts in
      music. All other arts present to the mind a definite creation; those of
      music are indefinite&mdash;infinite. We are compelled to accept the ideas
      of the poet, the painter&rsquo;s picture, the sculptor&rsquo;s statue; but music each
      one can interpret at the will of his sorrow or his gladness, his hope or
      his despair. While other arts restrict our mind by fixing it on a
      predestined object, music frees it to roam over all nature which it alone
      has the power of expressing. You shall hear how I interpret Rossini&rsquo;s <i>Mose</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned across to the Frenchman to speak to him, without being
      overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses is the liberator of an enslaved race!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Remember that,
      and you will see with what religious hope the whole house will listen to
      the prayer of the rescued Hebrews, with what a thunder of applause it will
      respond!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the leader raised his bow, Emilio flung himself into a back seat. The
      Duchess pointed out the place he had left, for the physician to take it.
      But the Frenchman was far more curious to know what had gone wrong between
      the lovers than to enter the halls of music built up by the man whom all
      Italy was applauding&mdash;for it was the day of Rossini&rsquo;s triumph in his
      own country. He was watching the Duchess, and she was talking with a
      feverish excitement. She reminded him of the Niobe he had admired at
      Florence: the same dignity in woe, the same physical control; and yet her
      soul shone though, in the warm flush of her cheeks; and her eyes, where
      anxiety was disguised under a flash of pride, seemed to scorch the tears
      away by their fire. Her suppressed grief seemed calmer when she looked at
      Emilio, who never took his eyes off her; it was easy to see that she was
      trying to mollify some fierce despair. The state of her feelings gave a
      certain loftiness to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most women when under the stress of some unusual agitation, she
      overstepped her ordinary limitations and assumed something of the
      Pythoness, though still remaining calm and beautiful; for it was the form
      of her thoughts that was wrung with desperation, not the features of her
      face. And perhaps she wanted to shine with all her wit to lend some charm
      to life and detain her lover from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the orchestra had given out the three chords in C major, placed at
      the opening by the composer to announce that the overture will be sung&mdash;for
      the real overture is the great movement beginning with this stern attack,
      and ending only when light appears at the command of Moses&mdash;the
      Duchess could not control a little spasmodic start, that showed how
      entirely the music was in accordance with her concealed distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those three chords freeze the blood,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;They announce trouble.
      Listen attentively to this introduction; the terrible lament of a nation
      stricken by the hand of God. What wailing! The King, the Queen, their
      first-born son, all the dignitaries of the kingdom are sighing; they are
      wounded in their pride, in their conquests; checked in their avarice. Dear
      Rossini! you have done well to throw this bone to gnaw to the <i>Tedeschi</i>,
      who declared we had no harmony, no science!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will hear the ominous melody the maestro has engrafted on to this
      profound harmonic composition, worthy to compare with the most elaborate
      structures of the Germans, but never fatiguing or tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You French, who carried through such a bloodthirsty revolution, who
      crushed your aristocracy under the paw of the lion mob, on the day when
      this oratorio is performed in your capital, you will understand this
      glorious dirge of the victims on whom God is avenging his chosen people.
      None but an Italian could have written this pregnant and inexhaustible
      theme&mdash;truly Dantesque. Do you think that it is nothing to have such
      a dream of vengeance, even for a moment? Handel, Sebastian Bach, all you
      old German masters, nay, even you, great Beethoven, on your knees! Here is
      the queen of arts, Italy triumphant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess had spoken while the curtain was being raised. And now the
      physician heard the sublime symphony with which the composer introduces
      the great Biblical drama. It is to express the sufferings of a whole
      nation. Suffering is uniform in its expression, especially physical
      suffering. Thus, having instinctively felt, like all men of genius, that
      here there must be no variety of idea, the musician, having hit on his
      leading phrase, has worked it out in various keys, grouping the masses and
      the dramatis personae to take up the theme through modulations and
      cadences of admirable structure. In such simplicity is power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The effect of this strain, depicting the sensations of night and cold in
      a people accustomed to live in the bright rays of the sun, and sung by the
      people and their princes, is most impressive. There is something
      relentless in that slow phrase of music; it is cold and sinister, like an
      iron bar wielded by some celestial executioner, and dropping in regular
      rhythm on the limbs of all his victims. As we hear it passing from C minor
      into G minor, returning to C and again to the dominant G, starting afresh
      and <i>fortissimo</i> on the tonic B flat, drifting into F major and back
      to C minor, and in each key in turn more ominously terrible, chill, and
      dark, we are compelled at last to enter into the impression intended by
      the composer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman was, in fact, deeply moved when all this united sorrow
      exploded in the cry:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O Nume d&rsquo;Israel,
  Se brami in liberta
  Il popol tuo fedel,
  Di lui di noi pieta!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      (O God of Israel, if thou wouldst see thy faithful people free, have mercy
      on them, and on us.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was a grander synthesis composed of natural effects or a more
      perfect idealization of nature. In a great national disaster, each one for
      a long time bewails himself alone; then, from out of the mass, rises up,
      here and there, a more emphatic and vehement cry of anguish; finally, when
      the misery has fallen on all, it bursts forth like a tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as they all recognize a common grievance, the dull murmurs of the
      people become cries of impatience. Rossini has proceeded on this
      hypothesis. After the outcry in C major, Pharoah sings his grand
      recitative: <i>Mano ultrice di un Dio</i> (Avenging hand of God), after
      which the original subject is repeated with more vehement expression. All
      Egypt appeals to Moses for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess had taken advantage of the pause for the entrance of Moses and
      Aaron to give this interpretation of that fine introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them weep!&rdquo; she added passionately. &ldquo;They have done much ill. Expiate
      your sins, Egyptians, expiate the crimes of your maddened Court! With what
      amazing skill has this great painter made use of all the gloomy tones of
      music, of all that is saddest on the musical palette! What creepy
      darkness! what a mist! Is not your very spirit in mourning? Are you not
      convinced of the reality of the blackness that lies over the land? Do you
      not feel that Nature is wrapped in the deepest shades? There are no
      palm-trees, no Egyptian palaces, no landscape. And what a healing to your
      soul will the deeply religious strain be of the heaven-sent Healer who
      will stay this cruel plague! How skilfully is everything wrought up to end
      in that glorious invocation of Moses to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a learned elaboration, which Capraja could explain to you, this appeal
      to heaven is accompanied by brass instruments only; it is that which gives
      it such a solemn, religious cast. And not merely is the artifice fine in
      its place; note how fertile in resource is genius. Rossini has derived
      fresh beauty from the difficulty he himself created. He has the strings in
      reserve to express daylight when it succeeds to the darkness, and thus
      produces one of the greatest effects ever achieved in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till this inimitable genius showed the way never was such a result
      obtained with mere <i>recitative</i>. We have not, so far, had an air or a
      duet. The poet has relied on the strength of the idea, on the vividness of
      his imagery, and the realism of the declamatory passages. This scene of
      despair, this darkness that may be felt, these cries of anguish,&mdash;the
      whole musical picture is as fine as your great Poussin&rsquo;s <i>Deluge</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moses waved his staff, and it was light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, monsieur, does not the music vie with the sun, whose splendor it
      has borrowed, with nature, whose phenomena it expresses in every detail?&rdquo;
       the Duchess went on, in an undertone. &ldquo;Art here reaches its climax; no
      musician can get beyond this. Do not you hear Egypt waking up after its
      long torpor? Joy comes in with the day. In what composition, ancient or
      modern, will you find so grand a passage? The greatest gladness in
      contrast to the deepest woe! What exclamations! What gleeful notes! The
      oppressed spirit breathes again. What delirium in the <i>tremolo</i> of
      the orchestra! What a noble <i>tutti</i>! This is the rejoicing of a
      delivered nation. Are you not thrilled with joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician, startled by the contrast, was, in fact, clapping his hands,
      carried away by admiration for one of the finest compositions of modern
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Brava la Doni!</i>&rdquo; said Vendramin, who had heard the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the introduction is ended,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You have gone through a great
      sensation,&rdquo; she added, turning to the Frenchman. &ldquo;Your heart is beating;
      in the depths of your imagination you have a splendid sunrise, flooding
      with light a whole country that before was cold and dark. Now, would you
      know the means by which the musician has worked, so as to admire him
      to-morrow for the secrets of his craft after enjoying the results
      to-night? What do you suppose produces this effect of daylight&mdash;so
      sudden, so complicated, and so complete? It consists of a simple chord of
      C, constantly reiterated, varied only by the chord of 4-6. This reveals
      the magic of his touch. To show you the glory of light he has worked by
      the same means that he used to represent darkness and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This dawn in imagery is, in fact, absolutely the same as the natural
      dawn; for light is one and the same thing everywhere, always alike in
      itself, the effects varying only with the objects it falls on. Is it not
      so? Well, the musician has taken for the fundamental basis of his music,
      for its sole <i>motif</i>, a simple chord in C. The sun first sheds its
      light on the mountain-tops and then in the valleys. In the same way the
      chord is first heard on the treble string of the violins with boreal
      mildness; it spreads through the orchestra, it awakes the instruments one
      by one, and flows among them. Just as light glides from one thing to the
      next, giving them color, the music moves on, calling out each rill of
      harmony till all flow together in the <i>tutti</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The violins, silent until now, give the signal with their tender <i>tremolo</i>,
      softly <i>agitato</i> like the first rays of morning. That light, cheerful
      movement, which caresses the soul, is cleverly supported by chords in the
      bass, and by a vague <i>fanfare</i> on the trumpets, restricted to their
      lowest notes, so as to give a vivid idea of the last cool shadows that
      linger in the valleys while the first warm rays touch the heights. Then
      all the wind is gradually added to strengthen the general harmony. The
      voices come in with sighs of delight and surprise. At last the brass
      breaks out, the trumpets sound. Light, the source of all harmony,
      inundates all nature; every musical resource is produced with a
      turbulence, a splendor, to compare with that of the Eastern sun. Even the
      triangle, with its reiterated C, reminds us by its shrill accent and
      playful rhythm of the song of early birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus the same key, freshly treated by the master&rsquo;s hand, expresses the
      joy of all nature, while it soothes the grief it uttered before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the hall-mark of the great genius: Unity. It is the same but
      different. In one and the same phrase we find a thousand various feelings
      of woe, the misery of a nation. In one and the same chord we have all the
      various incidents of awakening nature, every expression of the nation&rsquo;s
      joy. These two tremendous passages are soldered into one by the prayer to
      an ever-living God, author of all things, of that woe and that gladness
      alike. Now is not that introduction by itself a grand poem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next comes a quintette such as Rossini can give us. If he was ever
      justified in giving vent to that flowery, voluptuous grace for which
      Italian music is blamed, is it not in this charming movement in which each
      person expresses joy? The enslaved people are delivered, and yet a passion
      in peril is fain to moan. Pharaoh&rsquo;s son loves a Hebrew woman, and she must
      leave him. What gives its ravishing charm to this quintette is the return
      to the homelier feelings of life after the grandiose picture of two
      stupendous and national emotions:&mdash;general misery, general joy,
      expressed with the magic force stamped on them by divine vengeance and
      with the miraculous atmosphere of the Bible narrative. Now, was not I
      right?&rdquo; added Massimilla, as the noble <i>sretto</i> came to a close.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Voci di giubilo,
  D&rsquo; in&rsquo;orno eccheggino,
  Di pace l&rsquo; Iride
  Per noi spunto.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      (Cries of joy sound about us. The rainbow of peace dawns upon us.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ingeniously the composer has constructed this passage!&rdquo; she went on,
      after waiting for a reply. &ldquo;He begins with a solo on the horn, of divine
      sweetness, supported by <i>arpeggios</i> on the harps; for the first
      voices to be heard in this grand concerted piece are those of Moses and
      Aaron returning thanks to the true God. Their strain, soft and solemn,
      reverts to the sublime ideas of the invocation, and mingles, nevertheless,
      with the joy of the heathen people. This transition combines the heavenly
      and the earthly in a way which genius alone could invent, giving the <i>andante</i>
      of this quintette a glow of color that I can only compare to the light
      thrown by Titian on his Divine Persons. Did you observe the exquisite
      interweaving of the voices? the clever entrances by which the composer has
      grouped them round the main idea given out by the orchestra? the learned
      progressions that prepare us for the festal <i>allegro</i>? Did you not
      get a glimpse, as it were, of dancing groups, the dizzy round of a whole
      nation escaped from danger? And when the clarionet gives the signal for
      the <i>stretto</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Voci di giubilo</i>,&rsquo;&mdash;so brilliant and
      gay, was not your soul filled with the sacred pyrrhic joy of which David
      speaks in the Psalms, ascribing it to the hills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would make a delightful dance tune,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French! French! always French!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duchess, checked in her
      exultant mood by this sharp thrust. &ldquo;Yes; you would be capable of taking
      that wonderful burst of noble and dainty rejoicing and turning it into a
      rigadoon. Sublime poetry finds no mercy in your eyes. The highest genius,&mdash;saints,
      kings, disasters,&mdash;all that is most sacred must pass under the rods
      of caricature. And the vulgarizing of great music by turning it into a
      dance tune is to caricature it. With you, wit kills soul, as argument
      kills reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all sat in silence through the <i>recitative</i> of Osiride and
      Membrea, who plot to annul the order given by Pharaoh for the departure of
      the Hebrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I vexed you?&rdquo; asked the physician to the Duchess. &ldquo;I should be in
      despair. Your words are like a magic wand. They unlock the pigeon-holes of
      my brain, and let out new ideas, vivified by this sublime music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;you have praised our great composer after your own
      fashion. Rossini will be a success with you, for the sake of his witty and
      sensual gifts. Let us hope that he may find some noble souls, in love with
      the ideal&mdash;which must exist in your fruitful land,&mdash;to
      appreciate the sublimity, the loftiness, of such music. Ah, now we have
      the famous duet, between Elcia and Osiride!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and she went
      on, taking advantage of the triple salvo of applause which hailed la
      Tinti, as she made her first appearance on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If la Tinti has fully understood the part of Elcia, you will hear the
      frenzied song of a woman torn by her love for her people, and her passion
      for one of their oppressors, while Osiride, full of mad adoration for his
      beautiful vassal, tries to detain her. The opera is built up as much on
      that grand idea as on that of Pharaoh&rsquo;s resistance to the power of God and
      of liberty; you must enter into it thoroughly or you will not understand
      this stupendous work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notwithstanding the disfavor you show to the dramas invented by our <i>libretto</i>
      writers, you must allow me to point out the skill with which this one is
      constructed. The antithesis required in every fine work, and eminently
      favorable to music, is well worked out. What can be finer than a whole
      nation demanding liberty, held in bondage by bad faith, upheld by God, and
      piling marvel on marvel to gain freedom? What more dramatic than the
      Prince&rsquo;s love for a Hebrew woman, almost justifying treason to the
      oppressor&rsquo;s power?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is what is expressed in this bold and stupendous musical poem;
      Rossini has stamped each nation with its fantastic individuality, for we
      have attributed to them a certain historic grandeur to which every
      imagination subscribes. The songs of the Hebrews, and their trust in God,
      are perpetually contrasted with Pharaoh&rsquo;s shrieks of rage and vain
      efforts, represented with a strong hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment Osiride, thinking only of love, hopes to detain his
      mistress by the memories of their joys as lovers; he wants to conquer the
      attractions of her feeling for her people. Here, then, you will find
      delicious languor, the glowing sweetness, the voluptuous suggestions of
      Oriental love, in the air &lsquo;<i>Ah! se puoi cosi lasciarmi</i>,&rsquo; sung by
      Osiride, and in Elcia&rsquo;s reply, &lsquo;<i>Ma perche cosi straziarmi?</i>&rsquo; No; two
      hearts in such melodious unison could never part,&rdquo; she went on, looking at
      the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lovers are suddenly interrupted by the exultant voice of the
      Hebrew people in the distance, which recalls Elcia. What a delightful and
      inspiriting <i>allegro</i> is the theme of this march, as the Israelites
      set out for the desert! No one but Rossini can make wind instruments and
      trumpets say so much. And is not the art which can express in two phrases
      all that is meant by the &lsquo;native land&rsquo; certainly nearer to heaven than the
      others? This clarion-call always moves me so deeply that I cannot find
      words to tell you how cruel it is to an enslaved people to see those who
      are free march away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess&rsquo; eyes filled with tears as she listened to the grand movement,
      which in fact crowns the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dov&rsquo; e mai quel core amante</i>,&rdquo; she murmured in Italian, as la Tinti
      began the delightful <i>aria</i> of the <i>stretto</i> in which she
      implores pity for her grief. &ldquo;But what is the matter? The pit are
      dissatisfied&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genovese is braying like a stage,&rdquo; replied the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, this first duet with la Tinti was spoilt by Genovese&rsquo;s
      utter breakdown. His excellent method, recalling that of Crescentini and
      Veluti, seemed to desert him completely. A <i>sostenuto</i> in the wrong
      place, an embellishment carried to excess, spoilt the effect; or again a
      loud climax with no due <i>crescendo</i>, an outburst of sound like water
      tumbling through a suddenly opened sluice, showed complete and wilful
      neglect of the laws of good taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pit was in the greatest excitement. The Venetian public believed there
      was a deliberate plot between Genovese and his friends. La Tinti was
      recalled and applauded with frenzy while Genovese had a hint or two
      warning him of the hostile feeling of the audience. During this scene,
      highly amusing to a Frenchman, while la Tinti was recalled eleven times to
      receive alone the frantic acclamations of the house,&mdash;Genovese, who
      was all but hissed, not daring to offer her his hand,&mdash;the doctor
      made a remark to the Duchess as to the <i>stretto</i> of the duet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Rossini ought to have expressed the deepest
      grief, and I find on the contrary an airy movement, a tone of ill-timed
      cheerfulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;This mistake is the result of a tyrannous
      custom which composers are expected to obey. He was thinking more of his
      prima donna than of Elcia when he wrote that <i>stretto</i>. But this
      evening, even if la Tinti had been more brilliant than ever, I could throw
      myself so completely into the situation, that the passage, lively as it
      is, is to me full of sadness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician looked attentively from the Prince to the Duchess, but could
      not guess the reason that held them apart, and that made this duet seem to
      them so heartrending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now comes a magnificent thing, the scheming of Pharaoh against the
      Hebrews. The great <i>aria &lsquo;A rispettarmi apprenda&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> (Learn to respect
      me) is a triumph for Carthagenova, who will express superbly the offended
      pride and the duplicity of a sovereign. The Throne will speak. He will
      withdraw the concessions that have been made, he arms himself in wrath.
      Pharaoh rises to his feet to clutch the prey that is escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rossini never wrote anything grander in style, or stamped with more
      living and irresistible energy. It is a consummate work, supported by an
      accompaniment of marvelous orchestration, as indeed is every portion of
      this opera. The vigor of youth illumines the smallest details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole house applauded this noble movement, which was admirably
      rendered by the singer, and thoroughly appreciated by the Venetians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the <i>finale</i>,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;you hear a repetition of the
      march, expressive of the joy of deliverance and of faith in God, who
      allows His people to rush off gleefully to wander in the Desert! What
      lungs but would be refreshed by the aspirations of a whole nation freed
      from slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, beloved and living melodies! Glory to the great genius who has known
      how to give utterance to such feelings! There is something essentially
      warlike in that march, proclaiming that the God of armies is on the side
      of these people. How full of feeling are these strains of thanksgiving!
      The imagery of the Bible rises up in our mind; this glorious musical <i>scena</i>
      enables us to realize one of the grandest dramas of that ancient and
      solemn world. The religious form given to some of the voice parts, and the
      way in which they come in, one by one, to group with the others, express
      all we have ever imagined of the sacred marvels of that early age of
      humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet this fine concerted piece is no more than a development of the
      theme of the march into all its musical outcome. That theme is the
      inspiring element alike for the orchestra and the voices, for the air, and
      for the brilliant instrumentation that supports it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elcia now comes to join the crowd; and to give shade to the rejoicing
      spirit of this number, Rossini has made her utter her regrets. Listen to
      her <i>duettino</i> with Amenofi. Did blighted love ever express itself in
      lovelier song? It is full of the grace of a <i>notturno</i>, of the secret
      grief of hopeless love. How sad! how sad! The Desert will indeed be a
      desert to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this comes the fierce conflict of the Egyptians and the Hebrews.
      All their joy is spoiled, their march stopped by the arrival of the
      Egyptians. Pharaoh&rsquo;s edict is proclaimed in a musical phrase, hollow and
      dread, which is the leading <i>motif</i> of the <i>finale</i>; we could
      fancy that we hear the tramp of the great Egyptian army, surrounding the
      sacred phalanx of the true God, curling round it, like a long African
      serpent enveloping its prey. But how beautiful is the lament of the duped
      and disappointed Hebrews! Though, in truth, it is more Italian than
      Hebrew. What a superb passage introduces Pharaoh&rsquo;s arrival, when his
      presence brings the two leaders face to face, and all the moving passions
      of the drama. The conflict of sentiments in that sublime <i>ottetto</i>,
      where the wrath of Moses meets that of the two Pharaohs, is admirable.
      What a medley of voices and of unchained furies!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No grander subject was ever wrought out by a composer. The famous <i>finale</i>
      of <i>Don Giovanni</i>, after all, only shows us a libertine at odds with
      his victims, who invoke the vengeance of Heaven; while here earth and its
      dominions try to defeat God. Two nations are here face to face. And
      Rossini, having every means at his command, has made wonderful use of
      them. He has succeeded in expressing the turmoil of a tremendous storm as
      a background to the most terrible imprecations, without making it
      ridiculous. He has achieved it by the use of chords repeated in triple
      time&mdash;a monotonous rhythm of gloomy musical emphasis&mdash;and so
      persistent as to be quite overpowering. The horror of the Egyptians at the
      torrent of fire, the cries of vengeance from the Hebrews, needed a
      delicate balance of masses; so note how he has made the development of the
      orchestral parts follow that of the chorus. The <i>allegro assai</i> in C
      minor is terrible in the midst of that deluge of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess now,&rdquo; said Massimilla, at the moment when Moses, lifting his rod,
      brings down the rain of fire, and when the composer puts forth all his
      powers in the orchestra and on the stage, &ldquo;that no music ever more
      perfectly expressed the idea of distress and confusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have spread to the pit,&rdquo; remarked the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now? The pit is certainly in great excitement,&rdquo; said the
      Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>finale</i>, Genovese, his eyes fixed on la Tinti, had launched
      into such preposterous flourishes, that the pit, indignant at this
      interference with their enjoyment, were at a height of uproar. Nothing
      could be more exasperating to Italian ears than this contrast of good and
      bad singing. The manager went so far as to appear on the stage, to say
      that in reply to his remarks to his leading singer, Signor Genovese had
      replied that he knew not how or by what offence he had lost the
      countenance of the public, at the very moment when he was endeavoring to
      achieve perfection in his art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be as bad as he was yesterday&mdash;that was good enough for us!&rdquo;
       roared Capraja, in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion put the house into a good humor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to Italian custom, the ballet was not much attended to. In every
      box the only subject of conversation was Genovese&rsquo;s strange behavior, and
      the luckless manager&rsquo;s speech. Those who were admitted behind the scenes
      went off at once to inquire into the mystery of this performance, and it
      was presently rumored that la Tinti had treated her colleague Genovese to
      a dreadful scene, in which she had accused the tenor of being jealous of
      her success, of having hindered it by his ridiculous behavior, and even of
      trying to spoil her performance by acting passionate devotion. The lady
      was shedding bitter tears over this catastrophe. She had been hoping, she
      said, to charm her lover, who was somewhere in the house, though she had
      failed to discover him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without knowing the peaceful course of daily life in Venice at the present
      day, so devoid of incident that a slight altercation between two lovers,
      or the transient huskiness of a singer&rsquo;s voice becomes a subject of
      discussion, regarded of as much importance as politics in England, it is
      impossible to conceive of the excitement in the theatre and at the Cafe
      Florian. La Tinti was in love; la Tinti had been hindered in her
      performance; Genovese was mad or purposely malignant, inspired by the
      artist&rsquo;s jealousy so familiar to Italians! What a mine of matter for eager
      discussion!
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole pit was talking as men talk at the Bourse, and the result was
      such a clamor as could not fail to amaze a Frenchman accustomed to the
      quiet of the Paris theatres. The boxes were in a ferment like the stir of
      swarming bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      One man alone remained passive in the turmoil. Emilio Memmi, with his back
      to the stage and his eyes fixed on Massimilla with a melancholy
      expression, seemed to live in her gaze; he had not once looked round at
      the prima donna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not ask you, <i>caro carino</i>, what was the result of my
      negotiation,&rdquo; said Vendramin to Emilio. &ldquo;Your pure and pious Massimilla
      has been supremely kind&mdash;in short, she has been la Tinti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince&rsquo;s reply was a shake of his head, full of the deepest
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love has not descended from the ethereal spaces where you soar,&rdquo;
       said Vendramin, excited by opium. &ldquo;It is not yet materialized. This
      morning, as every day for six months&mdash;you felt flowers opening their
      scented cups under the dome of your skull that had expanded to vast
      proportions. All your blood moved to your swelling heart that rose to
      choke your throat. There, in there,&rdquo;&mdash;and he laid his hand on
      Emilio&rsquo;s breast,&mdash;&ldquo;you felt rapturous emotions. Massimilla&rsquo;s voice
      fell on your soul in waves of light; her touch released a thousand
      imprisoned joys which emerged from the convolutions of your brain to
      gather about you in clouds, to waft your etherealized body through the
      blue air to a purple glow far above the snowy heights, to where the pure
      love of angels dwells. The smile, the kisses of her lips wrapped you in a
      poisoned robe which burnt up the last vestiges of your earthly nature. Her
      eyes were twin stars that turned you into shadowless light. You knelt
      together on the palm-branches of heaven, waiting for the gates of Paradise
      to be opened; but they turned heavily on their hinges, and in your
      impatience you struck at them, but could not reach them. Your hand touched
      nothing but clouds more nimble than your desires. Your radiant companion,
      crowned with white roses like a bride of Heaven, wept at your anguish.
      Perhaps she was murmuring melodious litanies to the Virgin, while the
      demoniacal cravings of the flesh were haunting you with their shameless
      clamor, and you disdained the divine fruits of that ecstasy in which I
      live, though shortening my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your exaltation, my dear Vendramin,&rdquo; replied Emilio, calmly, &ldquo;is still
      beneath reality. Who can describe that purely physical exhaustion in which
      we are left by the abuse of a dream of pleasure, leaving the soul still
      eternally craving, and the spirit in clear possession of its faculties?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am weary of this torment, which is that of Tantalus. This is my
      last night on earth. After one final effort, our Mother shall have her
      child again&mdash;the Adriatic will silence my last sigh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you idiotic?&rdquo; cried Vendramin. &ldquo;No; you are mad; for madness, the
      crisis we despise, is the memory of an antecedent condition acting on our
      present state of being. The genius of my dreams has taught me that, and
      much else! You want to make one of the Duchess and la Tinti; nay, dear
      Emilio, take them separately; it will be far wiser. Raphael alone ever
      united form and idea. You want to be the Raphael of love; but chance
      cannot be commanded. Raphael was a &lsquo;fluke&rsquo; of God&rsquo;s creation, for He
      foreordained that form and idea should be antagonistic; otherwise nothing
      could live. When the first cause is more potent than the outcome, nothing
      comes of it. We must live either on earth or in the skies. Remain in the
      skies; it is always too soon to come down to earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the Duchess home,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;and make a last attempt&mdash;afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; cried Vendramin, anxiously, &ldquo;promise to call for me at
      Florian&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dialogue, in modern Greek, with which Vendramin and Emilio were
      familiar, as many Venetians are, was unintelligible to the Duchess and to
      the Frenchman. Although he was quite outside the little circle that held
      the Duchess, Emilio and Vendramin together&mdash;for these three
      understood each other by means of Italian glances, by turns arch and keen,
      or veiled and sidelong&mdash;the physician at last discerned part of the
      truth. An earnest entreaty from the Duchess had prompted Vendramin&rsquo;s
      suggestion to Emilio, for Massimilla had begun to suspect the misery
      endured by her lover in that cold empyrean where he was wandering, though
      she had no suspicions of la Tinti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two young men are mad!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the Prince,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;trust me to cure him. As to
      Vendramin, if he cannot understand this sublime music, he is perhaps
      incurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would but tell me the cause of their madness, I could cure them,&rdquo;
       said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since when have great physicians ceased to read men&rsquo;s minds?&rdquo; said
      she, jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ballet was long since ended; the second act of <i>Mose</i> was
      beginning. The pit was perfectly attentive. A rumor had got abroad that
      Duke Cataneo had lectured Genovese, representing to him what injury he was
      doing to Clarina, the <i>diva</i> of the day. The second act would
      certainly be magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Egyptian Prince and his father are on the stage,&rdquo; said the Duchess.
      &ldquo;They have yielded once more, though insulting the Hebrews, but they are
      trembling with rage. The father congratulates himself on his son&rsquo;s
      approaching marriage, and the son is in despair at this fresh obstacle,
      though it only increases his love, to which everything is opposed.
      Genovese and Carthagenova are singing admirably. As you see, the tenor is
      making his peace with the house. How well he brings out the beauty of the
      music! The phrase given out by the son on the tonic, and repeated by the
      father on the dominant, is all in character with the simple, serious
      scheme which prevails throughout the score; the sobriety of it makes the
      endless variety of the music all the more wonderful. All Egypt is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe that there is in modern music a composition more
      perfectly noble. The solemn and majestic paternity of a king is fully
      expressed in that magnificent theme, in harmony with the grand style that
      stamps the opera throughout. The idea of a Pharaoh&rsquo;s son pouring out his
      sorrows on his father&rsquo;s bosom could surely not be more admirably
      represented than in this grand imagery. Do you not feel a sense of the
      splendor we are wont to attribute to that monarch of antiquity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed sublime music,&rdquo; said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The air <i>Pace mia smarrita</i>, which the Queen will now sing, is one
      of those <i>bravura</i> songs which every composer is compelled to
      introduce, though they mar the general scheme of the work; but an opera
      would as often as not never see the light, if the prima donna&rsquo;s vanity
      were not duly flattered. Still, this musical &lsquo;sop&rsquo; is so fine in itself
      that it is performed as written, on every stage; it is so brilliant that
      the leading lady does not substitute her favorite show piece, as is very
      commonly done in operas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now comes the most striking movement in the score: the duet between
      Osiride and Elcia in the subterranean chamber where he has hidden her to
      keep her from the departing Israelites, and to fly with her himself from
      Egypt. The lovers are then intruded on by Aaron, who has been to warn
      Amalthea, and we get the grandest of all quartettes: <i>Mi manca la voce,
      mi sento morire</i>. This is one of those masterpieces that will survive
      in spite of time, that destroyer of fashion in music, for it speaks the
      language of the soul which can never change. Mozart holds his own by the
      famous <i>finale</i> to <i>Don Giovanni</i>; Marcello, by his psalm, <i>Coeli
      enarrant gloriam Dei</i>; Cimarosa, by the air <i>Pria che spunti</i>;
      Beethoven by his C minor symphony; Pergolesi, by his <i>Stabat Mater</i>;
      Rossini will live by <i>Mi manca la voce</i>. What is most to be admired
      in Rossini is his command of variety to form; to produce the effect here
      required, he has had recourse to the old structure of the canon in unison,
      to bring the voices in, and merge them in the same melody. As the form of
      these sublime melodies was new, he set them in an old frame; and to give
      it the more relief he has silenced the orchestra, accompanying the voices
      with the harps alone. It is impossible to show greater ingenuity of
      detail, or to produce a grander general effect.&mdash;Dear me! again an
      outbreak!&rdquo; said the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genovese, who had sung his duet with Carthagenova so well, was
      caricaturing himself now that la Tinti was on the stage. From a great
      singer he sank to the level of the most worthless chorus singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most formidable uproar arose that had ever echoed to the roof of the
      <i>Fenice</i>. The commotion only yielded to Clarina, and she, furious at
      the difficulties raised by Genovese&rsquo;s obstinacy, sang <i>Mi manca la voce</i>
      as it will never be sung again. The enthusiasm was tremendous; the
      audience forgot their indignation and rage in pleasure that was really
      acute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She floods my soul with purple glow!&rdquo; said Capraja, waving his hand in
      benediction at la <i>Diva</i> Tinti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven send all its blessings on your head!&rdquo; cried a gondolier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pharaoh will now revoke his commands,&rdquo; said the Duchess, while the
      commotion in the pit was calming down. &ldquo;Moses will overwhelm him, even on
      his throne, by declaring the death of every first-born son in Egypt,
      singing that strain of vengeance which augurs thunders from heaven, while
      above it the Hebrew clarions ring out. But you must clearly understand
      that this air is by Pacini; Carthagenova introduces it instead of that by
      Rossini. This air, <i>Paventa</i>, will no doubt hold its place in the
      score; it gives a bass too good an opportunity for displaying the quality
      of his voice, and expression here will carry the day rather than science.
      However, the air is full of magnificent menace, and it is possible that we
      may not be long allowed to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thunder of clapping and <i>bravos</i> hailed the song, followed by deep
      and cautious silence; nothing could be more significant or more thoroughly
      Venetian than the outbreak and its sudden suppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need say nothing of the coronation march announcing the enthronement of
      Osiride, intended by the King as a challenge to Moses; to hear it is
      enough. Their famous Beethoven has written nothing grander. And this
      march, full of earthly pomp, contrasts finely with the march of the
      Israelites. Compare them, and you will see that the music is full of
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elcia declares her love in the presence of the two Hebrew leaders, and
      then renounces it in the fine <i>aria</i>, <i>Porge la destra amata</i>.
      (Place your beloved hand.) Ah! What anguish! Only look at the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pit was shouting <i>bravo</i>, when Genovese left the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, free from her deplorable lover, we shall hear Tinti sing, <i>O
      desolata Elcia</i>&mdash;the tremendous <i>cavatina</i> expressive of love
      disapproved by God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where art thou, Rossini?&rdquo; cried Cataneo. &ldquo;If he could but hear the music
      created by his genius so magnificently performed,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Is not
      Clarina worthy of him?&rdquo; he asked Capraja. &ldquo;To give life to those notes by
      such gusts of flame, starting from the lungs and feeding in the air on
      some unknown matter which our ears inhale, and which bears us heavenwards
      in a rapture of love, she must be divine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is like the gorgeous Indian plant, which deserting the earth absorbs
      invisible nourishment from the atmosphere, and sheds from its spiral white
      blossom such fragrant vapors as fill the brain with dreams,&rdquo; replied
      Capraja.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being recalled, la Tinti appeared alone. She was received with a storm
      of applause; a thousand kisses were blown to her from finger-tips; she was
      pelted with roses, and a wreath was made of the flowers snatched from the
      ladies&rsquo; caps, almost all sent out from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>cavatina</i> was encored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How eagerly Capraja, with his passion for embellishments, must have
      looked forward to this air, which derives all its value from execution,&rdquo;
       remarked Massimilla. &ldquo;Here Rossini has, so to speak, given the reins over
      to the singer&rsquo;s fancy. Her <i>cadenzas</i> and her feeling are everything.
      With a poor voice or inferior execution, it would be nothing&mdash;the
      throat is responsible for the effects of this <i>aria</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The singer has to express the most intense anguish,&mdash;that of a woman
      who sees her lover dying before her very eyes. La Tinti makes the house
      ring with her highest notes; and Rossini, to leave pure singing free to do
      its utmost, has written it in the simplest, clearest style. Then, as a
      crowning effort, he has composed those heartrending musical cries: <i>Tormenti!
      Affanni! Smanie!</i> What grief, what anguish, in those runs. And la
      Tinti, you see, has quite carried the house off its feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman, bewildered by this adoring admiration throughout a vast
      theatre for the source of its delight, here had a glimpse of genuine
      Italian nature. But neither the Duchess nor the two young men paid any
      attention to the ovation. Clarina began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess feared that she was seeing her Emilio for the last time. As to
      the Prince: in the presence of the Duchess, the sovereign divinity who
      lifted him to the skies, he had forgotten where he was, he no longer heard
      the voice of the woman who had initiated him into the mysteries of earthly
      pleasure, for deep dejection made his ears tingle with a chorus of
      plaintive voices, half-drowned in a rushing noise as of pouring rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vendramin saw himself in an ancient Venetian costume, looking on at the
      ceremony of the <i>Bucentaur</i>. The Frenchman, who plainly discerned
      that some strange and painful mystery stood between the Prince and the
      Duchess, was racking his brain with shrewd conjecture to discover what it
      could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene had changed. In front of a fine picture, representing the Desert
      and the Red Sea, the Egyptians and Hebrews marched and countermarched
      without any effect on the feelings of the four persons in the Duchess&rsquo; 
      box. But when the first chords on the harps preluded the hymn of the
      delivered Israelites, the Prince and Vendramin rose and stood leaning
      against the opposite sides of the box, and the Duchess, resting her elbow
      on the velvet ledge, supported her head on her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman, understanding from this little stir, how important this
      justly famous chorus was in the opinion of the house, listened with devout
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience, with one accord, shouted for its repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if I were celebrating the liberation of Italy,&rdquo; thought a
      Milanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such music lifts up bowed heads, and revives hope in the most torpid,&rdquo;
       said a man from the Romagna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this scene,&rdquo; said Massimilla, whose emotion was evident, &ldquo;science is
      set aside. Inspiration, alone, dictated this masterpiece; it rose from the
      composer&rsquo;s soul like a cry of love! As to the accompaniment, it consists
      of the harps; the orchestra appears only at the last repetition of that
      heavenly strain. Rossini can never rise higher than in this prayer; he
      will do as good work, no doubt, but never better: the sublime is always
      equal to itself; but this hymn is one of the things that will always be
      sublime. The only match for such a conception might be found in the psalms
      of the great Marcello, a noble Venetian, who was to music what Giotto was
      to painting. The majesty of the phrase, unfolding itself with episodes of
      inexhaustible melody, is comparable with the finest things ever invented
      by religious writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How simple is the structure! Moses opens the attack in G minor, ending in
      a cadenza in B flat which allows the chorus to come in, <i>pianissimo</i>
      at first, in B flat, returning by modulations to G minor. This splendid
      treatment of the voices, recurring three times, ends in the last strophe
      with a <i>stretto</i> in G major of absolutely overpowering effect. We
      feel as though this hymn of a nation released from slavery, as it mounts
      to heaven, were met by kindred strains falling from the higher spheres.
      The stars respond with joy to the ecstasy of liberated mortals. The
      rounded fulness of the rhythm, the deliberate dignity of the graduations
      leading up to the outbursts of thanksgiving, and its slow return raise
      heavenly images in the soul. Could you not fancy that you saw heaven open,
      angels holding sistrums of gold, prostrate seraphs swinging their fragrant
      censers, and the archangels leaning on the flaming swords with which they
      have vanquished the heathen?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret of this music and its refreshing effect on the soul is, I
      believe, that of a very few works of human genius: it carries us for the
      moment into the infinite; we feel it within us; we see it, in those
      melodies as boundless as the hymns sung round the throne of God. Rossini&rsquo;s
      genius carries us up to prodigious heights, whence we look down on a
      promised land, and our eyes, charmed by heavenly light, gaze into
      limitless space. Elcia&rsquo;s last strain, having almost recovered from her
      grief, brings a feeling of earth-born passions into this hymn of
      thanksgiving. This, again, is a touch of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sing!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duchess, as she listened to the last stanza with
      the same gloomy enthusiasm as the singers threw into it. &ldquo;Sing! You are
      free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken in a voice that startled the physician. To divert
      Massimilla from her bitter reflections, while the excitement of recalling
      la Tinti was at its height, he engaged her in one of the arguments in
      which the French excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in explaining this grand work&mdash;which I shall come
      to hear again to-morrow with a fuller comprehension, thanks to you, of its
      structure and its effect&mdash;you have frequently spoken of the color of
      the music, and of the ideas it depicts; now I, as an analyst, a
      materialist, must confess that I have always rebelled against the
      affectation of certain enthusiasts, who try to make us believe that music
      paints with tones. Would it not be the same thing if Raphael&rsquo;s admirers
      spoke of his singing with colors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the language of musicians,&rdquo; replied the Duchess, &ldquo;<i>painting</i> is
      arousing certain associations in our souls, or certain images in our
      brain; and these memories and images have a color of their own; they are
      sad or cheerful. You are battling for a word, that is all. According to
      Capraja, each instrument has its task, its mission, and appeals to certain
      feelings in our souls. Does a pattern in gold on a blue ground produce the
      same sensations in you as a red pattern on black or green? In these, as in
      music, there are no figures, no expression of feeling; they are purely
      artistic, and yet no one looks at them with indifference. Has not the oboe
      the peculiar tone that we associate with the open country, in common with
      most wind instruments? The brass suggests martial ideas, and rouses us to
      vehement or even somewhat furious feelings. The strings, for which the
      material is derived from the organic world, seem to appeal to the subtlest
      fibres of our nature; they go to the very depths of the heart. When I
      spoke of the gloomy hue, and the coldness of the tones in the introduction
      to <i>Mose</i>, was I not fully as much justified as your critics are when
      they speak of the &lsquo;color&rsquo; in a writer&rsquo;s language? Do you not acknowledge
      that there is a nervous style, a pallid style, a lively, and a
      highly-colored style? Art can paint with words, sounds, colors, lines,
      form; the means are many; the result is one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Italian architect might give us the same sensation that is produced in
      us by the introduction to <i>Mose</i>, by constructing a walk through
      dark, damp avenues of tall, thick trees, and bringing us out suddenly in a
      valley full of streams, flowers, and mills, and basking in the sunshine.
      In their greatest moments the arts are but the expression of the grand
      scenes of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not learned enough to enlarge on the philosophy of music; go and
      talk to Capraja; you will be amazed at what he can tell you. He will say
      that every instrument that depends on the touch or breath of man for its
      expression and length of note, is superior as a vehicle of expression to
      color, which remains fixed, or speech, which has its limits. The language
      of music is infinite; it includes everything; it can express all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now do you see wherein lies the pre-eminence of the work you have just
      heard? I can explain it in a few words. There are two kinds of music: one,
      petty, poor, second-rate, always the same, based on a hundred or so of
      phrases which every musician has at his command, a more or less agreeable
      form of babble which most composers live in. We listen to their strains,
      their would-be melodies, with more or less satisfaction, but absolutely
      nothing is left in our mind; by the end of the century they are forgotten.
      But the nations, from the beginning of time till our own day, have
      cherished as a precious treasure certain strains which epitomize their
      instincts and habits; I might almost say their history. Listen to one of
      these primitive tones,&mdash;the Gregorian chant, for instance, is, in
      sacred song, the inheritance of the earliest peoples,&mdash;and you will
      lose yourself in deep dreaming. Strange and immense conceptions will
      unfold within you, in spite of the extreme simplicity of these rudimentary
      relics. And once or twice in a century&mdash;not oftener, there arises a
      Homer of music, to whom God grants the gift of being ahead of his age; men
      who can compact melodies full of accomplished facts, pregnant with mighty
      poetry. Think of this; remember it. The thought, repeated by you, will
      prove fruitful; it is melody, not harmony, that can survive the shocks of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The music of this oratorio contains a whole world of great and sacred
      things. A work which begins with that introduction and ends with that
      prayer is immortal&mdash;as immortal as the Easter hymn, <i>O filii et
      filioe</i>, as the <i>Dies iroe</i> of the dead, as all the songs which in
      every land have outlived its splendor, its happiness, and its ruined
      prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears the Duchess wiped away as she quitted her box showed plainly
      that she was thinking of the Venice that is no more; and Vendramin kissed
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The performance ended with the most extraordinary chaos of noises: abuse
      and hisses hurled at Genovese and a fit of frenzy in praise of la Tinti.
      It was a long time since the Venetians had had so lively an evening. They
      were warmed and revived by that antagonism which is never lacking in
      Italy, where the smallest towns always throve on the antagonistic
      interests of two factions: the Geulphs and Ghibellines everywhere; the
      Capulets and the Montagues at Verona; the Geremei and the Lomelli at
      Bologna; the Fieschi and the Doria at Genoa; the patricians and the
      populace, the Senate and tribunes of the Roman republic; the Pazzi and the
      Medici at Florence; the Sforza and the Visconti at Milan; the Orsini and
      the Colonna at Rome,&mdash;in short, everywhere and on every occasion
      there has been the same impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the streets there were already <i>Genovists</i> and <i>Tintists</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince escorted the Duchess, more depressed than ever by the loves of
      Osiride; she feared some similar disaster to her own, and could only cling
      to Emilio, as if to keep him next her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember your promise,&rdquo; said Vendramin. &ldquo;I will wait for you in the
      square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vendramin took the Frenchman&rsquo;s arm, proposing that they should walk
      together on the Piazza San Marco while awaiting the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be only too glad if he should not come,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the text for a conversation between the two, Vendramin regarding
      it as a favorable opportunity for consulting the physician, and telling
      him the singular position Emilio had placed himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman did as every Frenchman does on all occasions: he laughed.
      Vendramin, who took the matter very seriously, was angry; but he was
      mollified when the disciple of Majendie, of Cuvier, of Dupuytren, and of
      Brossais assured him that he believed he could cure the Prince of his
      high-flown raptures, and dispel the heavenly poetry in which he shrouded
      Massimilla as in a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A happy form of misfortune!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The ancients, who were not such
      fools as might be inferred from their crystal heaven and their ideas on
      physics, symbolized in the fable of Ixion the power which nullifies the
      body and makes the spirit lord of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vendramin and the doctor presently met Genovese, and with him the
      fantastic Capraja. The melomaniac was anxious to learn the real cause of
      the tenor&rsquo;s <i>fiasco</i>. Genovese, the question being put to him, talked
      fast, like all men who can intoxicate themselves by the ebullition of
      ideas suggested to them by a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, signori, I love her, I worship her with a frenzy of which I never
      believed myself capable, now that I am tired of women. Women play the
      mischief with art. Pleasure and work cannot be carried on together. Clara
      fancies that I was jealous of her success, that I wanted to hinder her
      triumph at Venice; but I was clapping in the side-scenes, and shouted <i>Diva</i>
      louder than any one in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even that,&rdquo; said Cataneo, joining them, &ldquo;does not explain why, from
      being a divine singer, you should have become one of the most execrable
      performers who ever piped air through his larynx, giving none of the charm
      even which enchants and bewitches us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said the singer. &ldquo;I a bad singer! I who am the equal of the greatest
      performers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the doctor and Vendramin, Capraja, Cataneo, and Genovese had
      made their way to the piazzetta. It was midnight. The glittering bay,
      outlined by the churches of San Giorgio and San Paulo at the end of the
      Giudecca, and the beginning of the Grand Canal, that opens so mysteriously
      under the <i>Dogana</i> and the church of Santa Maria della Salute, lay
      glorious and still. The moon shone on the barques along the Riva de&rsquo; 
      Schiavoni. The waters of Venice, where there is no tide, looked as if they
      were alive, dancing with a myriad spangles. Never had a singer a more
      splendid stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genovese, with an emphatic flourish, seemed to call Heaven and Earth to
      witness; and then, with no accompaniment but the lapping waves, he sang <i>Ombra
      adorata</i>, Crescentini&rsquo;s great air. The song, rising up between the
      statues of San Teodoro and San Giorgio, in the heart of sleeping Venice
      lighted by the moon, the words, in such strange harmony with the scene,
      and the melancholy passion of the singer, held the Italians and the
      Frenchman spellbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very first notes, Vendramin&rsquo;s face was wet with tears. Capraja
      stood as motionless as one of the statues in the ducal palace. Cataneo
      seemed moved to some feeling. The Frenchman, taken by surprise, was
      meditative, like a man of science in the presence of a phenomenon that
      upsets all his fundamental axioms. These four minds, all so different,
      whose hopes were so small, who believed in nothing for themselves or after
      themselves, who regarded their own existence as that of a transient and a
      fortuitous being,&mdash;like the little life of a plant or a beetle,&mdash;had
      a glimpse of Heaven. Never did music more truly merit the epithet divine.
      The consoling notes, as they were poured out, enveloped their souls in
      soft and soothing airs. On these vapors, almost visible, as it seemed to
      the listeners, like the marble shapes about them in the silver moonlight,
      angels sat whose wings, devoutly waving, expressed adoration and love. The
      simple, artless melody penetrated to the soul as with a beam of light. It
      was a holy passion!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the singer&rsquo;s vanity roused them from their emotion with a terrible
      shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, am I a bad singer?&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      His audience only regretted that the instrument was not a thing of Heaven.
      This angelic song was then no more than the outcome of a man&rsquo;s offended
      vanity! The singer felt nothing, thought nothing, of the pious sentiments
      and divine images he could create in others,&mdash;no more, in fact, than
      Paganini&rsquo;s violin knows what the player makes it utter. What they had seen
      in fancy was Venice lifting its shroud and singing&mdash;and it was merely
      the result of a tenor&rsquo;s <i>fiasco</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you guess the meaning of such a phenomenon?&rdquo; the Frenchman asked of
      Capraja, wishing to make him talk, as the Duchess had spoken of him as a
      profound thinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What phenomenon?&rdquo; said Capraja.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genovese&mdash;who is admirable in the absence of la Tinti, and when he
      sings with her is a braying ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He obeys an occult law of which one of your chemists might perhaps give
      you the mathematical formula, and which the next century will no doubt
      express in a statement full of <i>x</i>, <i>a</i>, and <i>b</i>, mixed up
      with little algebraic signs, bars, and quirks that give me the colic; for
      the finest conceptions of mathematics do not add much to the sum total of
      our enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When an artist is so unfortunate as to be full of the passion he wishes
      to express, he cannot depict it because he is the thing itself instead of
      its image. Art is the work of the brain, not of the heart. When you are
      possessed by a subject you are a slave, not a master; you are like a king
      besieged by his people. Too keen a feeling, at the moment when you want to
      represent that feeling, causes an insurrection of the senses against the
      governing faculty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might we not convince ourselves of this by some further experiment?&rdquo; said
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cataneo, you might bring your tenor and the prima donna together again,&rdquo;
       said Capraja to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;come to sup with me. We ought to
      reconcile the tenor and la Clarina; otherwise the season will be ruined in
      Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gondoliers!&rdquo; called Cataneo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said Vendramin. &ldquo;Memmi is waiting for me at Florian&rsquo;s; I
      cannot leave him to himself. We must make him tipsy to-night, or he will
      kill himself to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Corpo santo!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke. &ldquo;I must keep that young fellow
      alive, for the happiness and future prospects of my race. I will invite
      him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all went back to Florian&rsquo;s, where the assembled crowd were holding an
      eager and stormy discussion to which the tenor&rsquo;s arrival put an end. In
      one corner, near a window looking out on the colonnade, gloomy, with a
      fixed gaze and rigid attitude, Emilio was a dismal image of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That crazy fellow,&rdquo; said the physician, in French, to Vendramin, &ldquo;does
      not know what he wants. Here is a man who can make of a Massimilla Doni a
      being apart from the rest of creation, possessing her in heaven, amid
      ideal splendor such as no power on earth can make real. He can behold his
      mistress for ever sublime and pure, can always hear within him what we
      have just heard on the seashore; can always live in the light of a pair of
      eyes which create for him the warm and golden glow that surrounds the
      Virgin in Titian&rsquo;s Assumption,&mdash;after Raphael had invented it or had
      it revealed to him for the Transfiguration,&mdash;and this man only longs
      to smirch the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my advice he must needs combine his sensual joys and his heavenly
      adoration in one woman. In short, like all the rest of us, he will have a
      mistress. He had a divinity, and the wretched creature insists on her
      being a female! I assure you, monsieur, he is resigning heaven. I will not
      answer for it that he may not ultimately die of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ye women&rsquo;s faces, delicately outlined in a pure and radiant oval,
      reminding us of those creations of art where it has most successfully
      competed with nature! Divine feet that cannot walk, slender forms that an
      earthly breeze would break, shapes too frail ever to conceive, virgins
      that we dreamed of as we grew out of childhood, admired in secret, and
      adored without hope, veiled in the beams of some unwearying desire,&mdash;maids
      whom we may never see again, but whose smile remains supreme in our life,
      what hog of Epicurus could insist on dragging you down to the mire of this
      earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun, monsieur, gives light and heat to the world, only because it is
      at a distance of thirty-three millions of leagues. Get nearer to it, and
      science warns you that it is not really hot or luminous,&mdash;for science
      is of some use,&rdquo; he added, looking at Capraja.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so bad for a Frenchman and a doctor,&rdquo; said Capraja, patting the
      foreigner on the shoulder. &ldquo;You have in those words explained the thing
      which Europeans least understand in all Dante: his Beatrice. Yes,
      Beatrice, that ideal figure, the queen of the poet&rsquo;s fancies, chosen above
      all the elect, consecrated with tears, deified by memory, and for ever
      young in the presence of ineffectual desire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said the Duke to Emilio, &ldquo;come and sup with me. You cannot
      refuse the poor Neapolitan whom you have robbed both of his wife and of
      his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This broad Neapolitan jest, spoken with an aristocratic good manner, made
      Emilio smile; he allowed the Duke to take his arm and lead him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cataneo had already sent a messenger to his house from the cafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Palazzo Memmi was on the Grand Canal, not far from Santa Maria
      della Salute, the way thither on foot was round by the Rialto, or it could
      be reached in a gondola. The four guests would not separate and preferred
      to walk; the Duke&rsquo;s infirmities obliged him to get into his gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about two in the morning anybody passing the Memmi palace would have
      seen light pouring out of every window across the Grand Canal, and have
      heard the delightful overture to <i>Semiramide</i> performed at the foot
      of the steps by the orchestra of the <i>Fenice</i>, as a serenade to la
      Tinti.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company were at supper in the second floor gallery. From the balcony
      la Tinti in return sang Almavida&rsquo;s <i>Buona sera</i> from <i>Il Barbiere</i>,
      while the Duke&rsquo;s steward distributed payment from his master to the poor
      artists and bid them to dinner the next day, such civilities as are
      expected of grand signors who protect singers, and of fine ladies who
      protect tenors and basses. In these cases there is nothing for it but to
      marry all the <i>corps de theatre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cataneo did things handsomely; he was the manager&rsquo;s banker, and this
      season was costing him two thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had all the palace furnished, had imported a French cook, and wines
      of all lands. So the supper was a regal entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, seated next la Tinti, was keenly alive, all through the meal,
      to what poets in every language call the darts of love. The transcendental
      vision of Massimilla was eclipsed, just as the idea of God is sometimes
      hidden by clouds of doubt in the consciousness of solitary thinkers.
      Clarina thought herself the happiest woman in the world as she perceived
      Emilio was in love with her. Confident of retaining him, her joy was
      reflected in her features, her beauty was so dazzling that the men, as
      they lifted their glasses, could not resist bowing to her with instinctive
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchess is not to compare with la Tinti,&rdquo; said the Frenchman,
      forgetting his theory under the fire of the Sicilian&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenor ate and drank languidly; he seemed to care only to identify
      himself with the prima donna&rsquo;s life, and had lost the hearty sense of
      enjoyment which is characteristic of Italian men singers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, signorina,&rdquo; said the Duke, with an imploring glance at Clarina,
      &ldquo;and you, <i>caro prima uomo</i>,&rdquo; he added to Genovese, &ldquo;unite your
      voices in one perfect sound. Let us have the C of <i>Qual portento</i>,
      when light appears in the oratorio we have just heard, to convince my old
      friend Capraja of the superiority of unison to any embellishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will carry her off from that Prince she is in love with; for she adores
      him&mdash;it stares me in the face!&rdquo; said Genovese to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the amazement of the guests who had heard Genovese out of doors,
      when he began to bray, to coo, mew, squeal, gargle, bellow, thunder, bark,
      shriek, even produce sounds which could only be described as a hoarse
      rattle,&mdash;in short, go through an incomprehensible farce, while his
      face was transfigured with rapturous expression like that of a martyr, as
      painted by Zurbaran or Murillo, Titian or Raphael. The general shout of
      laughter changed to almost tragical gravity when they saw that Genovese
      was in utter earnest. La Tinti understood that her companion was in love
      with her, and had spoken the truth on the stage, the land of falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poverino!</i>&rdquo; she murmured, stroking the Prince&rsquo;s hand under the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all that is holy!&rdquo; cried Capraja, &ldquo;will you tell me what score you are
      reading at this moment&mdash;murdering Rossini? Pray inform us what you
      are thinking about, what demon is struggling in your throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A demon!&rdquo; cried Genovese, &ldquo;say rather the god of music. My eyes, like
      those of Saint-Cecilia, can see angels, who, pointing with their fingers,
      guide me along the lines of the score which is written in notes of fire,
      and I am trying to keep up with them. PER DIO! do you not understand? The
      feeling that inspires me has passed into my being; it fills my heart and
      my lungs; my soul and throat have but one life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never, in a dream, listened to the most glorious strains, the
      ideas of unknown composers who have made use of pure sound as nature has
      hidden it in all things,&mdash;sound which we call forth, more or less
      perfectly, by the instruments we employ to produce masses of various
      color; but which in those dream-concerts are heard free from the
      imperfections of the performers who cannot be all feeling, all soul? And
      I, I give you that perfection, and you abuse me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as mad at the pit of the <i>Fenice</i>, who hissed me! I scorned
      the vulgar crowd for not being able to mount with me to the heights whence
      we reign over art, and I appeal to men of mark, to a Frenchman&mdash;Why,
      he is gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour ago,&rdquo; said Vendramin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pity. He, perhaps, would have understood me, since Italians,
      lovers of art, do not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On you go!&rdquo; said Capraja, with a smile, and tapping lightly on the
      tenor&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Ride off on the divine Ariosto&rsquo;s hippogriff; hunt down your
      radiant chimera, musical visionary as you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, all the others, believing that Genovese was drunk, let
      him talk without listening to him. Capraja alone had understood the case
      put by the French physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the wine of Cyprus was loosening every tongue, and each one was
      prancing on his favorite hobby, the doctor, in a gondola, was waiting for
      the Duchess, having sent her a note written by Vendramin. Massimilla
      appeared in her night wrapper, so much had she been alarmed by the tone of
      the Prince&rsquo;s farewell, and so startled by the hopes held out by the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, as he placed her in a seat and desired the
      gondoliers to start, &ldquo;at this moment Prince Emilio&rsquo;s life is in danger,
      and you alone can save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Can you resign yourself to play a degrading part&mdash;in spite of
      the noblest face to be seen in Italy? Can you drop from the blue sky where
      you dwell, into the bed of a courtesan? In short, can you, an angel of
      refinement, of pure and spotless beauty, condescend to imagine what the
      love must be of a Tinti&mdash;in her room, and so effectually as to
      deceive the ardor of Emilio, who is indeed too drunk to be very
      clear-sighted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said she, with a smile that betrayed to the Frenchman a
      side he had not as yet perceived of the delightful nature of an Italian
      woman in love. &ldquo;I will out-do la Tinti, if need be, to save my friend&rsquo;s
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will thus fuse into one two kinds of love, which he sees as
      distinct&mdash;divided by a mountain of poetic fancy, that will melt away
      like the snow on a glacier under the beams of the midsummer sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be eternally your debtor,&rdquo; said the Duchess, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the French doctor returned to the gallery, where the orgy had by this
      time assumed the stamp of Venetian frenzy, he had a look of satisfaction
      which the Prince, absorbed by la Tinti, failed to observe; he was
      promising himself a repetition of the intoxicating delights he had known.
      La Tinti, a true Sicilian, was floating on the tide of a fantastic passion
      on the point of being gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor whispered a few words to Vendramin, and la Tinti was uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you plotting?&rdquo; she inquired of the Prince&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you kind-hearted?&rdquo; said the doctor in her ear, with the sternness of
      an operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words pierced to her comprehension like a dagger-thrust to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to save Emilio&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; added Vendramin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said the doctor to Clarina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hapless singer rose and went to the other end of the table where,
      between Vendramin and the Frenchman, she looked like a criminal between
      the confessor and the executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled for a long time, but yielded at last for love of Emilio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s last words were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must cure Genovese!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke a word to the tenor as she went round the table. She returned to
      the Prince, put her arm round his neck and kissed his hair with an
      expression of despair which struck Vendramin and the Frenchman, the only
      two who had their wits about them, then she vanished into her room.
      Emilio, seeing Genovese leave the table, while Cataneo and Capraja were
      absorbed in a long musical discussion, stole to the door of the bedroom,
      lifted the curtain, and slipped in, like an eel into the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see, Cataneo,&rdquo; said Capraja, &ldquo;you have exacted the last drop of
      physical enjoyment, and there you are, hanging on a wire like a cardboard
      harlequin, patterned with scars, and never moving unless the string is
      pulled of a perfect unison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Capraja, who have squeezed ideas dry, are not you in the same
      predicament? Do you not live riding the hobby of a <i>cadenza</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I possess the whole world!&rdquo; cried Capraja, with a sovereign gesture of
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have devoured it!&rdquo; replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      They observed that the physician and Vendramin were gone, and that they
      were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, after a night of perfect happiness, the Prince&rsquo;s sleep was
      disturbed by a dream. He felt on his heart the trickle of pearls, dropped
      there by an angel; he woke, and found himself bathed in the tears of
      Massimilla Doni. He was lying in her arms, and she gazed at him as he
      slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at the <i>Fenice</i>,&mdash;though la Tinti had not allowed
      him to rise till two in the afternoon, which is said to be very bad for a
      tenor voice,&mdash;Genovese sang divinely in his part in <i>Semiramide</i>.
      He was recalled with la Tinti, fresh crowns were given, the pit was wild
      with delight; the tenor no longer attempted to charm the prima donna by
      angelic methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vendramin was the only person whom the doctor could not cure. Love for a
      country that has ceased to be is a love beyond curing. The young Venetian,
      by dint of living in his thirteenth century republic, and in the arms of
      that pernicious courtesan called opium, when he found himself in the
      work-a-day world to which reaction brought him, succumbed, pitied and
      regretted by his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, how shall the end of this adventure be told&mdash;for it is too
      disastrously domestic. A word will be enough for the worshipers of the
      ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess was expecting an infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peris, the naiads, the fairies, the sylphs of ancient legend, the
      Muses of Greece, the Marble Virgins of the Certosa at Pavia, the Day and
      Night of Michael Angelo, the little Angels which Bellini was the first to
      put at the foot of his Church pictures, and which Raphael painted so
      divinely in his Virgin with the Donor, and the Madonna who shivers at
      Dresden, the lovely Maidens by Orcagna in the Church of San-Michele, at
      Florence, the celestial choir round the tomb in Saint-Sebaldus, at
      Nuremberg, the Virgins of the Duomo, at Milan, the whole population of a
      hundred Gothic Cathedrals, all the race of beings who burst their mould to
      visit you, great imaginative artists&mdash;all these angelic and
      disembodied maidens gathered round Massimilla&rsquo;s bed, and wept!

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
