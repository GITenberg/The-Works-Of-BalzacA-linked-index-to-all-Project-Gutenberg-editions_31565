    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are houses in certain provincial towns whose aspect inspires
      melancholy, akin to that called forth by sombre cloisters, dreary
      moorlands, or the desolation of ruins. Within these houses there is,
      perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the
      skeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a stranger
      might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters suddenly the
      pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose half-monastic face peers
      beyond the window-casing at the sound of an unaccustomed step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of a
      dwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep street
      leading to the chateau in the upper part of the town. This street&mdash;now
      little frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certain sections&mdash;is
      remarkable for the resonance of its little pebbly pavement, always clean
      and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuous road-way, for the peaceful
      stillness of its houses, which belong to the Old town and are over-topped
      by the ramparts. Houses three centuries old are still solid, though built
      of wood, and their divers aspects add to the originality which commends
      this portion of Saumur to the attention of artists and antiquaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormous oaken
      beams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crown with a black
      bas-relief the lower floor of most of them. In one place these transverse
      timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish line along the frail wall
      of a dwelling covered by a roof <i>en colombage</i> which bends beneath
      the weight of years, and whose rotting shingles are twisted by the
      alternate action of sun and rain. In another place blackened, worn-out
      window-sills, with delicate sculptures now scarcely discernible, seem too
      weak to bear the brown clay pots from which springs the heart&rsquo;s-ease or
      the rose-bush of some poor working-woman. Farther on are doors studded
      with enormous nails, where the genius of our forefathers has traced
      domestic hieroglyphics, of which the meaning is now lost forever. Here a
      Protestant attested his belief; there a Leaguer cursed Henry IV.;
      elsewhere some bourgeois has carved the insignia of his <i>noblesse de
      cloches</i>, symbols of his long-forgotten magisterial glory. The whole
      history of France is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where an artisan
      enshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman, on the
      stone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorial bearings may still
      be seen, battered by the many revolutions that have shaken France since
      1789. In this hilly street the ground-floors of the merchants are neither
      shops nor warehouses; lovers of the Middle Ages will here find the <i>ouvrouere</i>
      of our forefathers in all its naive simplicity. These low rooms, which
      have no shop-frontage, no show-windows, in fact no glass at all, are deep
      and dark and without interior or exterior decoration. Their doors open in
      two parts, each roughly iron-bound; the upper half is fastened back within
      the room, the lower half, fitted with a spring-bell, swings continually to
      and fro. Air and light reach the damp den within, either through the upper
      half of the door, or through an open space between the ceiling and a low
      front wall, breast-high, which is closed by solid shutters that are taken
      down every morning, put up every evening, and held in place by heavy iron
      bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. No delusive display is
      there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to be,&mdash;such,
      for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and salt, a few
      bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from the joists above,
      iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a few pieces of cloth upon
      the shelves. Enter. A neat girl, glowing with youth, wearing a white
      kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops her knitting and calls her father
      or her mother, one of whom comes forward and sells you what you want,
      phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly, according to his or her individual
      character, whether it be a matter of two sous&rsquo; or twenty thousand francs&rsquo; 
      worth of merchandise. You may see a cooper, for instance, sitting in his
      doorway and twirling his thumbs as he talks with a neighbor. To all
      appearance he owns nothing more than a few miserable boat-ribs and two or
      three bundles of laths; but below in the port his teeming wood-yard
      supplies all the cooperage trade of Anjou. He knows to a plank how many
      casks are needed if the vintage is good. A hot season makes him rich, a
      rainy season ruins him; in a single morning puncheons worth eleven francs
      have been known to drop to six. In this country, as in Touraine,
      atmospheric vicissitudes control commercial life. Wine-growers,
      proprietors, wood-merchants, coopers, inn-keepers, mariners, all keep
      watch of the sun. They tremble when they go to bed lest they should hear
      in the morning of a frost in the night; they dread rain, wind, drought,
      and want water, heat, and clouds to suit their fancy. A perpetual duel
      goes on between the heavens and their terrestrial interests. The barometer
      smooths, saddens, or makes merry their countenances, turn and turn about.
      From end to end of this street, formerly the Grand&rsquo;Rue de Saumur, the
      words: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s golden weather,&rdquo; are passed from door to door; or each man
      calls to his neighbor: &ldquo;It rains louis,&rdquo; knowing well what a sunbeam or
      the opportune rainfall is bringing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou&rsquo;s worth of
      merchandise can be bought from these worthy traders. Each has his
      vineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in the country.
      This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profits provided for, the
      merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend in parties of pleasure, in
      making observations, in criticisms, and in continual spying. A housewife
      cannot buy a partridge without the neighbors asking the husband if it were
      cooked to a turn. A young girl never puts her head near a window that she
      is not seen by idling groups in the street. Consciences are held in the
      light; and the houses, dark, silent, impenetrable as they seem, hide no
      mysteries. Life is almost wholly in the open air; every household sits at
      its own threshold, breakfasts, dines, and quarrels there. No one can pass
      along the street without being examined; in fact formerly, when a stranger
      entered a provincial town he was bantered and made game of from door to
      door. From this came many good stories, and the nickname <i>copieux</i>,
      which was applied to the inhabitants of Angers, who excelled in such urban
      sarcasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of this
      hilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of the
      neighborhood. The melancholy dwelling where the events of the following
      history took place is one of these mansions,&mdash;venerable relics of a
      century in which men and things bore the characteristics of simplicity
      which French manners and customs are losing day by day. Follow the
      windings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whose irregularities awaken
      recollections that plunge the mind mechanically into reverie, and you will
      see a somewhat dark recess, in the centre of which is hidden the door of
      the house of Monsieur Grandet. It is impossible to understand the force of
      this provincial expression&mdash;the house of Monsieur Grandet&mdash;without
      giving the biography of Monsieur Grandet himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes and effects
      can never be fully understood by those who have not, at one time or
      another, lived in the provinces. In 1789 Monsieur Grandet&mdash;still
      called by certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number of such old
      persons has perceptibly diminished&mdash;was a master-cooper, able to
      read, write, and cipher. At the period when the French Republic offered
      for sale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur, the cooper,
      then forty years of age, had just married the daughter of a rich
      wood-merchant. Supplied with the ready money of his own fortune and his
      wife&rsquo;s <i>dot</i>, in all about two thousand louis-d&rsquo;or, Grandet went to
      the newly established &ldquo;district,&rdquo; where, with the help of two hundred
      double louis given by his father-in-law to the surly republican who
      presided over the sales of the national domain, he obtained for a song,
      legally if not legitimately, one of the finest vineyards in the
      arrondissement, an old abbey, and several farms. The inhabitants of Saumur
      were so little revolutionary that they thought Pere Grandet a bold man, a
      republican, and a patriot with a mind open to all the new ideas; though in
      point of fact it was open only to vineyards. He was appointed a member of
      the administration of Saumur, and his pacific influence made itself felt
      politically and commercially. Politically, he protected the ci-devant
      nobles, and prevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of the lands
      and property of the <i>emigres</i>; commercially, he furnished the
      Republican armies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine, and
      took his pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women whose
      lands had been reserved for the last lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, and harvested
      still better pickings. Under the Empire he was called Monsieur Grandet.
      Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, and superseded Monsieur
      Grandet (who was supposed to have worn the Phrygian cap) by a man of his
      own surroundings, a future baron of the Empire. Monsieur Grandet quitted
      office without regret. He had constructed in the interests of the town
      certain fine roads which led to his own property; his house and lands,
      very advantageously assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the
      registration of his various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant
      care, had become the &ldquo;head of the country,&rdquo;&mdash;a local term used to
      denote those that produced the finest quality of wine. He might have asked
      for the cross of the Legion of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event occurred in 1806. Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-seven years
      of age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit of their
      legitimate love, was ten years old. Monsieur Grandet, whom Providence no
      doubt desired to compensate for the loss of his municipal honors,
      inherited three fortunes in the course of this year,&mdash;that of Madame
      de la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the mother of Madame Grandet;
      that of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, her grandfather; and, lastly, that
      of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother on the mother&rsquo;s side: three
      inheritances, whose amount was not known to any one. The avarice of the
      deceased persons was so keen that for a long time they had hoarded their
      money for the pleasure of secretly looking at it. Old Monsieur de la
      Bertelliere called an investment an extravagance, and thought he got
      better interest from the sight of his gold than from the profits of usury.
      The inhabitants of Saumur consequently estimated his savings according to
      &ldquo;the revenues of the sun&rsquo;s wealth,&rdquo; as they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which our
      mania for equality can never rub out. He became the most imposing
      personage in the arrondissement. He worked a hundred acres of vineyard,
      which in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundred hogsheads of wine.
      He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whose windows and arches he had
      walled up for the sake of economy,&mdash;a measure which preserved them,&mdash;also
      a hundred and twenty-seven acres of meadow-land, where three thousand
      poplars, planted in 1793, grew and flourished; and finally, the house in
      which he lived. Such was his visible estate; as to his other property,
      only two persons could give even a vague guess at its value: one was
      Monsieur Cruchot, a notary employed in the usurious investments of
      Monsieur Grandet; the other was Monsieur des Grassins, the richest banker
      in Saumur, in whose profits Grandet had a certain covenanted and secret
      share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted with the
      deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces, they
      publicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet that observers
      estimated the amount of his property by the obsequious attention which
      they bestowed upon him. In all Saumur there was no one not persuaded that
      Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, some hiding-place full of louis,
      where he nightly took ineffable delight in gazing upon great masses of
      gold. Avaricious people gathered proof of this when they looked at the
      eyes of the good man, to which the yellow metal seemed to have conveyed
      its tints. The glance of a man accustomed to draw enormous interest from
      his capital acquires, like that of the libertine, the gambler, or the
      sycophant, certain indefinable habits,&mdash;furtive, eager, mysterious
      movements, which never escape the notice of his co-religionists. This
      secret language is in a certain way the freemasonry of the passions.
      Monsieur Grandet inspired the respectful esteem due to one who owed no man
      anything, who, skilful cooper and experienced wine-grower that he was,
      guessed with the precision of an astronomer whether he ought to
      manufacture a thousand puncheons for his vintage, or only five hundred,
      who never failed in any speculation, and always had casks for sale when
      casks were worth more than the commodity that filled them, who could store
      his whole vintage in his cellars and bide his time to put the puncheons on
      the market at two hundred francs, when the little proprietors had been
      forced to sell theirs for five louis. His famous vintage of 1811,
      judiciously stored and slowly disposed of, brought him in more than two
      hundred and forty thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Financially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tiger and a
      boa-constrictor. He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a long while,
      spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis, and then rest
      tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion, impassible, methodical,
      and cold. No one saw him pass without a feeling of admiration mingled with
      respect and fear; had not every man in Saumur felt the rending of those
      polished steel claws? For this one, Maitre Cruchot had procured the money
      required for the purchase of a domain, but at eleven per cent. For that
      one, Monsieur des Grassins discounted bills of exchange, but at a
      frightful deduction of interest. Few days ever passed that Monsieur
      Grandet&rsquo;s name was not mentioned either in the markets or in social
      conversations at the evening gatherings. To some the fortune of the old
      wine-grower was an object of patriotic pride. More than one merchant, more
      than one innkeeper, said to strangers with a certain complacency:
      &ldquo;Monsieur, we have two or three millionaire establishments; but as for
      Monsieur Grandet, he does not himself know how much he is worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property of the
      worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he had made
      yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of that property,
      it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money a sum nearly
      equal to the value of his estate. So that when, after a game of boston or
      an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the talk fell upon Monsieur
      Grandet, knowing people said: &ldquo;Le Pere Grandet? le Pere Grandet must have
      at least five or six millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out the
      amount,&rdquo; answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, when either
      chanced to overhear the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the people of
      Saumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet. When the Parisian,
      with a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, they looked at each
      other and shook their heads with an incredulous air. So large a fortune
      covered with a golden mantle all the actions of this man. If in early days
      some peculiarities of his life gave occasion for laughter or ridicule,
      laughter and ridicule had long since died away. His least important
      actions had the authority of results repeatedly shown. His speech, his
      clothing, his gestures, the blinking of his eyes, were law to the
      country-side, where every one, after studying him as a naturalist studies
      the result of instinct in the lower animals, had come to understand the
      deep mute wisdom of his slightest actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a hard winter,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;Pere Grandet has put on his fur
      gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty of wine
      this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat. His farmers supplied
      him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs, butter, and his
      tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant was bound, over and above
      his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain and return him the flour and
      bran. La Grande Nanon, his only servant, though she was no longer young,
      baked the bread of the household herself every Saturday. Monsieur Grandet
      arranged with kitchen-gardeners who were his tenants to supply him with
      vegetables. As to fruits, he gathered such quantities that he sold the
      greater part in the market. His fire-wood was cut from his own hedgerows
      or taken from the half-rotten old sheds which he built at the corners of
      his fields, and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut
      up, and obligingly stacked in his wood-house, receiving in return his
      thanks. His only known expenditures were for the consecrated bread, the
      clothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of their chairs in church, the
      wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the saucepans, lights, taxes,
      repairs on his buildings, and the costs of his various industries. He had
      six hundred acres of woodland, lately purchased, which he induced a
      neighbor&rsquo;s keeper to watch, under the promise of an indemnity. After the
      acquisition of this property he ate game for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s manners were very simple. He spoke little. He usually
      expressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered in a soft
      voice. After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first came into notice,
      the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as he was required to
      speak at length or to maintain an argument. This stammering, the
      incoherence of his language, the flux of words in which he drowned his
      thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributed to defects of education,
      were in reality assumed, and will be sufficiently explained by certain
      events in the following history. Four sentences, precise as algebraic
      formulas, sufficed him usually to grasp and solve all difficulties of life
      and commerce: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I cannot; I will not; I will see about it.&rdquo;
       He never said yes, or no, and never committed himself to writing. If
      people talked to him he listened coldly, holding his chin in his right
      hand and resting his right elbow in the back of his left hand, forming in
      his own mind opinions on all matters, from which he never receded. He
      reflected long before making any business agreement. When his opponent,
      after careful conversation, avowed the secret of his own purposes,
      confident that he had secured his listener&rsquo;s assent, Grandet answered: &ldquo;I
      can decide nothing without consulting my wife.&rdquo; His wife, whom he had
      reduced to a state of helpless slavery, was a useful screen to him in
      business. He went nowhere among friends; he neither gave nor accepted
      dinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming to economize in everything,
      even movement. He never disturbed or disarranged the things of other
      people, out of respect for the rights of property. Nevertheless, in spite
      of his soft voice, in spite of his circumspect bearing, the language and
      habits of a coarse nature came to the surface, especially in his own home,
      where he controlled himself less than elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built,
      with calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints, and broad
      shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the small-pox; his
      chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth were white; his eyes
      had that calm, devouring expression which people attribute to the
      basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles, was not without
      certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayish hair was said to be
      silver and gold by certain young people who did not realize the
      impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet. His nose, thick at
      the end, bore a veined wen, which the common people said, not without
      reason, was full of malice. The whole countenance showed a dangerous
      cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotism of a man long used to
      concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments of avarice and upon the only
      human being who was anything whatever to him,&mdash;his daughter and sole
      heiress, Eugenie. Attitude, manners, bearing, everything about him, in
      short, testified to that belief in himself which the habit of succeeding
      in all enterprises never fails to give to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, Monsieur
      Grandet&rsquo;s nature was of iron. His dress never varied; and those who saw
      him to-day saw him such as he had been since 1791. His stout shoes were
      tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thick woollen
      stockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silver buckles, a
      velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce, buttoned
      squarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a black cravat, and a
      quaker&rsquo;s hat. His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme, lasted him twenty
      months; to preserve them, he always laid them methodically on the brim of
      his hat in one particular spot. Saumur knew nothing further about this
      personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s house.
      The most important of the first three was a nephew of Monsieur Cruchot.
      Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts of Saumur this
      young man had added the name of Bonfons to that of Cruchot. He now signed
      himself C. de Bonfons. Any litigant so ill-advised as to call him Monsieur
      Cruchot would soon be made to feel his folly in court. The magistrate
      protected those who called him Monsieur le president, but he favored with
      gracious smiles those who addressed him as Monsieur de Bonfons. Monsieur
      le president was thirty-three years old, and possessed the estate of
      Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth seven thousand francs a year; he expected to
      inherit the property of his uncle the notary and that of another uncle,
      the Abbe Cruchot, a dignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours,
      both of whom were thought to be very rich. These three Cruchots, backed by
      a goodly number of cousins, and allied to twenty families in the town,
      formed a party, like the Medici in Florence; like the Medici, the Cruchots
      had their Pazzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, came
      assiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry her dear
      Adolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie. Monsieur des Grassins, the banker,
      vigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secret services
      constantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived in time upon the
      field of battle. The three des Grassins likewise had their adherents,
      their cousins, their faithful allies. On the Cruchot side the abbe, the
      Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by his brother the notary,
      sharply contested every inch of ground with his female adversary, and
      tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephew the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize
      thereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the various
      social circles of Saumur in violent agitation. Would Mademoiselle Grandet
      marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphe des Grassins? To this
      problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet would never give his daughter
      to the one or to the other. The old cooper, eaten up with ambition, was
      looking, they said, for a peer of France, to whom an income of three
      hundred thousand francs would make all the past, present, and future casks
      of the Grandets acceptable. Others replied that Monsieur and Madame des
      Grassins were nobles, and exceedingly rich; that Adolphe was a personable
      young fellow; and that unless the old man had a nephew of the pope at his
      beck and call, such a suitable alliance ought to satisfy a man who came
      from nothing,&mdash;a man whom Saumur remembered with an adze in his hand,
      and who had, moreover, worn the <i>bonnet rouge</i>. Certain wise heads
      called attention to the fact that Monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the
      right of entry to the house at all times, whereas his rival was received
      only on Sundays. Others, however, maintained that Madame des Grassins was
      more intimate with the women of the house of Grandet than the Cruchots
      were, and could put into their minds certain ideas which would lead,
      sooner or later, to success. To this the former retorted that the Abbe
      Cruchot was the most insinuating man in the world: pit a woman against a
      monk, and the struggle was even. &ldquo;It is diamond cut diamond,&rdquo; said a
      Saumur wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that the
      Grandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family, and
      that Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married to the son of
      Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-merchant. To this the
      Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied: &ldquo;In the first place, the two
      brothers have seen each other only twice in thirty years; and next,
      Monsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitious designs for his son. He is mayor
      of an arrondissement, a deputy, colonel of the National Guard, judge in
      the commercial courts; he disowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to
      ally himself with some ducal family,&mdash;ducal under favor of Napoleon.&rdquo;
       In short, was there anything not said of an heiress who was talked of
      through a circumference of fifty miles, and even in the public conveyances
      from Angers to Blois, inclusively!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over the
      Grassinists. The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park, its
      mansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about three
      millions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, who was
      obliged to liquidate his possessions. Maitre Cruchot, the president, and
      the abbe, aided by their adherents, were able to prevent the sale of the
      estate in little lots. The notary concluded a bargain with the young man
      for the whole property, payable in gold, persuading him that suits without
      number would have to be brought against the purchasers of small lots
      before he could get the money for them; it was better, therefore, to sell
      the whole to Monsieur Grandet, who was solvent and able to pay for the
      estate in ready money. The fine marquisate of Froidfond was accordingly
      conveyed down the gullet of Monsieur Grandet, who, to the great
      astonishment of Saumur, paid for it, under proper discount, with the usual
      formalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans. Monsieur Grandet took advantage
      of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see his chateau. Having
      cast a master&rsquo;s eye over the whole property, he returned to Saumur,
      satisfied that he had invested his money at five per cent, and seized by
      the stupendous thought of extending and increasing the marquisate of
      Froidfond by concentrating all his property there. Then, to fill up his
      coffers, now nearly empty, he resolved to thin out his woods and his
      forests, and to sell off the poplars in the meadows.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, &ldquo;the house of
      Monsieur Grandet,&rdquo;&mdash;that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standing
      above the town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts. The two pillars
      and the arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the door opened, were
      built, like the house itself, of tufa,&mdash;a white stone peculiar to the
      shores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardly more than two
      centuries. Numberless irregular holes, capriciously bored or eaten out by
      the inclemency of the weather, gave an appearance of the vermiculated
      stonework of French architecture to the arch and the side walls of this
      entrance, which bore some resemblance to the gateway of a jail. Above the
      arch was a long bas-relief, in hard stone, representing the four seasons,
      the faces already crumbling away and blackened. This bas-relief was
      surmounted by a projecting plinth, upon which a variety of chance growths
      had sprung up,&mdash;yellow pellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles,
      plantain, and even a little cherry-tree, already grown to some height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, and split
      in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly held in place by
      a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns. A small square
      grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up the middle panel and
      made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastened to it by a ring,
      which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail. This knocker, of the
      oblong shape and kind which our ancestors called <i>jaquemart</i>, looked
      like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary who examined it attentively
      might have found indications of the figure, essentially burlesque, which
      it once represented, and which long usage had now effaced. Through this
      little grating&mdash;intended in olden times for the recognition of
      friends in times of civil war&mdash;inquisitive persons could perceive, at
      the farther end of the dark and slimy vault, a few broken steps which led
      to a garden, picturesquely shut in by walls that were thick and damp, and
      through which oozed a moisture that nourished tufts of sickly herbage.
      These walls were the ruins of the ramparts, under which ranged the gardens
      of several neighboring houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a large hall,
      entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere. Few people
      know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou, Touraine, and
      Berry. The hall is at one and the same time antechamber, salon, office,
      boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domestic life, the common
      living-room. There the barber of the neighborhood came, twice a year, to
      cut Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s hair; there the farmers, the cure, the
      under-prefect, and the miller&rsquo;s boy came on business. This room, with two
      windows looking on the street, was entirely of wood. Gray panels with
      ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to bottom; the ceiling showed
      all its beams, which were likewise painted gray, while the space between
      them had been washed over in white, now yellow with age. An old brass
      clock, inlaid with arabesques, adorned the mantel of the ill-cut white
      stone chimney-piece, above which was a greenish mirror, whose edges,
      bevelled to show the thickness of the glass, reflected a thread of light
      the whole length of a gothic frame in damascened steel-work. The two
      copper-gilt candelabra which decorated the corners of the chimney-piece
      served a double purpose: by taking off the side-branches, each of which
      held a socket, the main stem&mdash;which was fastened to a pedestal of
      bluish marble tipped with copper&mdash;made a candlestick for one candle,
      which was sufficient for ordinary occasions. The chairs, antique in shape,
      were covered with tapestry representing the fables of La Fontaine; it was
      necessary, however, to know that writer well to guess at the subjects, for
      the faded colors and the figures, blurred by much darning, were difficult
      to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets,
      surmounted by dirty shelves. An old card-table in marquetry, of which the
      upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the two windows.
      Above this table was an oval barometer with a black border enlivened with
      gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiously disported themselves
      that the gilding had become problematical. On the panel opposite to the
      chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel, supposed to represent the
      grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, as a
      lieutenant in the French guard, and the deceased Madame Gentillet in the
      guise of a shepherdess. The windows were draped with curtains of red <i>gros
      de Tours</i> held back by silken cords with ecclesiastical tassels. This
      luxurious decoration, little in keeping with the habits of Monsieur
      Grandet, had been, together with the steel pier-glass, the tapestries, and
      the buffets, which were of rose-wood, included in the purchase of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs were
      raised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a height from
      which she could see the passers-by. A work-table of stained cherry-wood
      filled up the embrasure, and the little armchair of Eugenie Grandet stood
      beside it. In this spot the lives had flowed peacefully onward for fifteen
      years, in a round of constant work from the month of April to the month of
      November. On the first day of the latter month they took their winter
      station by the chimney. Not until that day did Grandet permit a fire to be
      lighted; and on the thirty-first of March it was extinguished, without
      regard either to the chills of the early spring or to those of a wintry
      autumn. A foot-warmer, filled with embers from the kitchen fire, which la
      Grande Nanon contrived to save for them, enabled Madame and Mademoiselle
      Grandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings of April and October.
      Mother and daughter took charge of the family linen, and spent their days
      so conscientiously upon a labor properly that of working-women, that if
      Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for her mother she was forced to take
      the time from sleep, and deceive her father to obtain the necessary light.
      For a long time the miser had given out the tallow candle to his daughter
      and la Grande Nanon just as he gave out every morning the bread and other
      necessaries for the daily consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of accepting
      willingly the despotism of her master. The whole town envied Monsieur and
      Madame Grandet the possession of her. La Grande Nanon, so called on
      account of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had lived with
      Monsieur Grandet for thirty-five years. Though she received only sixty
      francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the richest
      serving-women in Saumur. Those sixty francs, accumulating through
      thirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest four thousand francs
      in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot. This result of her long and persistent
      economy seemed gigantic. Every servant in the town, seeing that the poor
      sexagenarian was sure of bread for her old age, was jealous of her, and
      never thought of the hard slavery through which it had been won.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a
      situation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one. Yet the feeling
      was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired on the
      shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so they say, should
      be in keeping. Forced to leave a farm where she kept the cows, because the
      dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumur to find a place, full
      of the robust courage that shrinks from no labor. Le Pere Grandet was at
      that time thinking of marriage and about to set up his household. He
      espied the girl, rejected as she was from door to door. A good judge of
      corporeal strength in his trade as a cooper, he guessed the work that
      might be got out of a female creature shaped like a Hercules, as firm on
      her feet as an oak sixty years old on its roots, strong in the hips,
      square in the back, with the hands of a cartman and an honesty as sound as
      her unblemished virtue. Neither the warts which adorned her martial
      visage, nor the red-brick tints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the
      ragged garments of la Grande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that
      time still of an age when the heart shudders. He fed, shod, and clothed
      the poor girl, gave her wages, and put her to work without treating her
      too roughly. Seeing herself thus welcomed, la Grande Nanon wept secretly
      tears of joy, and attached herself in all sincerity to her master, who
      from that day ruled her and worked her with feudal authority. Nanon did
      everything. She cooked, she made the lye, she washed the linen in the
      Loire and brought it home on her shoulders; she got up early, she went to
      bed late; she prepared the food of the vine-dressers during the harvest,
      kept watch upon the market-people, protected the property of her master
      like a faithful dog, and even, full of blind confidence, obeyed without a
      murmur his most absurd exactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered with unheard-of
      difficulty, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old watch,&mdash;the first
      present he had made her during twenty years of service. Though he turned
      over to her his old shoes (which fitted her), it is impossible to consider
      that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the shoes were always thoroughly
      worn-out. Necessity had made the poor girl so niggardly that Grandet had
      grown to love her as we love a dog, and Nanon had let him fasten a spiked
      collar round her throat, whose spikes no longer pricked her. If Grandet
      cut the bread with rather too much parsimony, she made no complaint; she
      gaily shared the hygienic benefits derived from the severe regime of the
      household, in which no one was ever ill. Nanon was, in fact, one of the
      family; she laughed when Grandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed
      herself, and toiled as he did. What pleasant compensations there were in
      such equality! Never did the master have occasion to find fault with the
      servant for pilfering the grapes, nor for the plums and nectarines eaten
      under the trees. &ldquo;Come, fall-to, Nanon!&rdquo; he would say in years when the
      branches bent under the fruit and the farmers were obliged to give it to
      the pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harsh
      treatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet&rsquo;s ambiguous
      laugh was like a sunbeam. Moreover, Nanon&rsquo;s simple heart and narrow head
      could hold only one feeling and one idea. For thirty-five years she had
      never ceased to see herself standing before the wood-yard of Monsieur
      Grandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say: &ldquo;What do you want,
      young one?&rdquo; Her gratitude was ever new. Sometimes Grandet, reflecting that
      the poor creature had never heard a flattering word, that she was ignorant
      of all the tender sentiments inspired by women, that she might some day
      appear before the throne of God even more chaste than the Virgin Mary
      herself,&mdash;Grandet, struck with pity, would say as he looked at her,
      &ldquo;Poor Nanon!&rdquo; The exclamation was always followed by an undefinable look
      cast upon him in return by the old servant. The words, uttered from time
      to time, formed a chain of friendship that nothing ever parted, and to
      which each exclamation added a link. Such compassion arising in the heart
      of the miser, and accepted gratefully by the old spinster, had something
      inconceivably horrible about it. This cruel pity, recalling, as it did, a
      thousand pleasures to the heart of the old cooper, was for Nanon the sum
      total of happiness. Who does not likewise say, &ldquo;Poor Nanon!&rdquo; God will
      recognize his angels by the inflexions of their voices and by their secret
      sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were very many households in Saumur where the servants were better
      treated, but where the masters received far less satisfaction in return.
      Thus it was often said: &ldquo;What have the Grandets ever done to make their
      Grande Nanon so attached to them? She would go through fire and water for
      their sake!&rdquo; Her kitchen, whose barred windows looked into the court, was
      always clean, neat, cold,&mdash;a true miser&rsquo;s kitchen, where nothing went
      to waste. When Nanon had washed her dishes, locked up the remains of the
      dinner, and put out her fire, she left the kitchen, which was separated by
      a passage from the living-room, and went to spin hemp beside her masters.
      One tallow candle sufficed the family for the evening. The servant slept
      at the end of the passage in a species of closet lighted only by a
      fan-light. Her robust health enabled her to live in this hole with
      impunity; there she could hear the slightest noise through the deep
      silence which reigned night and day in that dreary house. Like a
      watch-dog, she slept with one ear open, and took her rest with a mind
      alert.

      A description of the other parts of the dwelling will be found connected
      with the events of this history, though the foregoing sketch of the hall,
      where the whole luxury of the household appears, may enable the reader to
      surmise the nakedness of the upper floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, la
      Grande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time. The autumn had been very
      fine. This particular day was a fete-day well known to the Cruchotines and
      the Grassinists. The six antagonists, armed at all points, were making
      ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass each other in testimonials of
      friendship. That morning all Saumur had seen Madame and Mademoiselle
      Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way to hear Mass at the parish
      church, and every one remembered that the day was the anniversary of
      Mademoiselle Eugenie&rsquo;s birth. Calculating the hour at which the family
      dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, the Abbe Cruchot, and Monsieur C. de
      Bonfons hastened to arrive before the des Grassins, and be the first to
      pay their compliments to Mademoiselle Eugenie. All three brought enormous
      bouquets, gathered in their little green-houses. The stalks of the flowers
      which the president intended to present were ingeniously wound round with
      a white satin ribbon adorned with gold fringe. In the morning Monsieur
      Grandet, following his usual custom on the days that commemorated the
      birth and the fete of Eugenie, went to her bedside and solemnly presented
      her with his paternal gift,&mdash;which for the last thirteen years had
      consisted regularly of a curious gold-piece. Madame Grandet gave her
      daughter a winter dress or a summer dress, as the case might be. These two
      dresses and the gold-pieces, of which she received two others on New
      Year&rsquo;s day and on her father&rsquo;s fete-day, gave Eugenie a little revenue of
      a hundred crowns or thereabouts, which Grandet loved to see her amass. Was
      it not putting his money from one strong-box to another, and, as it were,
      training the parsimony of his heiress? from whom he sometimes demanded an
      account of her treasure (formerly increased by the gifts of the
      Bertellieres), saying: &ldquo;It is to be your marriage dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;marriage dozen&rdquo; is an old custom sacredly preserved and still in
      force in many parts of central France. In Berry and in Anjou, when a young
      girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her a purse,
      in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces, or twelve
      dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. The poorest shepherd-girl
      never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozen coppers. They still
      tell in Issoudun of a certain &ldquo;dozen&rdquo; presented to a rich heiress, which
      contained a hundred and forty-four <i>portugaises d&rsquo;or</i>. Pope Clement
      VII., uncle of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, gave her when he married her to Henri
      II. a dozen antique gold medals of priceless value.
    </p>
    <p>
      During dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well in a
      new gown, exclaimed: &ldquo;As it is Eugenie&rsquo;s birthday let us have a fire; it
      will be a good omen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle will be married this year, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; said la Grande
      Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose,&mdash;the pheasant of
      tradesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any one suitable for her in Saumur,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet,
      glancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering her years,
      revealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor woman languished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is twenty-three years old to-day, the child; we must soon begin to
      think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward,
      slow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden. She had big
      bones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first sight
      a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither savor nor
      succulence. Her teeth were black and few in number, her mouth was
      wrinkled, her chin long and pointed. She was an excellent woman, a true la
      Bertelliere. L&rsquo;abbe Cruchot found occasional opportunity to tell her that
      she had not done ill; and she believed him. Angelic sweetness, the
      resignation of an insect tortured by children, a rare piety, a good heart,
      an unalterable equanimity of soul, made her universally pitied and
      respected. Her husband never gave her more than six francs at a time for
      her personal expenses. Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by her
      own fortune and her various inheritances brought Pere Grandet more than
      three hundred thousand francs, had always felt so profoundly humiliated by
      her dependence and the slavery in which she lived, against which the
      gentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that she had never
      asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds which Maitre
      Cruchot brought for her signature. This foolish secret pride, this
      nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded by Grandet, ruled
      the whole conduct of the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantine
      silk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore a large
      kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited straws sewn
      together, and almost always a black-silk apron. As she seldom left the
      house she wore out very few shoes. She never asked anything for herself.
      Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when he remembered how long a time
      had elapsed since he gave her the last six francs, always stipulated for
      the &ldquo;wife&rsquo;s pin-money&rdquo; when he sold his yearly vintage. The four or five
      louis presented by the Belgian or the Dutchman who purchased the wine were
      the chief visible signs of Madame Grandet&rsquo;s annual revenues. But after she
      had received the five louis, her husband would often say to her, as though
      their purse were held in common: &ldquo;Can you lend me a few sous?&rdquo; and the
      poor woman, glad to be able to do something for a man whom her confessor
      held up to her as her lord and master, returned him in the course of the
      winter several crowns out of the &ldquo;pin-money.&rdquo; When Grandet drew from his
      pocket the five-franc piece which he allowed monthly for the minor
      expenses,&mdash;thread, needles, and toilet,&mdash;of his daughter, he
      never failed to say as he buttoned his breeches&rsquo; pocket: &ldquo;And you, mother,
      do you want anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternal
      dignity, &ldquo;we will see about that later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wasted dignity! Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife.
      Philosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, of Eugenie,
      have surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of the ways of
      Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made to
      Eugenie&rsquo;s marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currant ratafia
      from Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s bed-chamber, and nearly fell as she came down the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You great stupid!&rdquo; said her master; &ldquo;are you going to tumble about like
      other people, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet; &ldquo;it ought to have been mended long
      ago. Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, &ldquo;as it
      is Eugenie&rsquo;s birthday, and you came near falling, take a little glass of
      ratafia to set you right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! I&rsquo;ve earned it,&rdquo; said Nanon; &ldquo;most people would have broken the
      bottle; but I&rsquo;d sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Nanon!&rdquo; said Grandet, filling a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t fall; I threw myself back on my haunches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! as it is Eugenie&rsquo;s birthday,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the step
      mended. You people don&rsquo;t know how to set your foot in the corner where the
      wood is still firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servant without
      any other light than that from the hearth, where the flames were lively,
      and went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, and tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I&rsquo;m an old hand at it,&rdquo; answered the former cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase and
      whistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth, the
      three Cruchots knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?&rdquo; asked Nanon, peeping through the little
      grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the
      ceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you&rsquo;ve come a-greeting,&rdquo; said Nanon, smelling the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, messieurs,&rdquo; cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
      with you in a moment. I&rsquo;m not proud; I am patching up a step on my
      staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man&rsquo;s house is his castle,&rdquo; said the
      president sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose. The president, profiting by the
      darkness, said to Eugenie:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day of your
      birth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the health which you
      now enjoy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare in Saumur;
      then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on each side of her
      neck with a complacency that made her blush. The president, who looked
      like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtship was progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony,&rdquo; said Grandet, entering. &ldquo;How well you do things
      on fete-days, Monsieur le president!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it concerns mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the abbe, armed with his own
      bouquet, &ldquo;every day is a fete-day for my nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbe kissed Eugenie&rsquo;s hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly kissed
      her on both cheeks, remarking: &ldquo;How we sprout up, to be sure! Every year
      is twelve months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who never forgot
      his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thought them funny,
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As this is Eugenie&rsquo;s birthday let us illuminate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket on each
      pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twisted round the
      end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, and then sat down
      beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, his daughter, and the
      two candles. The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy little man, with a red wig
      plastered down and a face like an old female gambler, said as he stretched
      out his feet, well shod in stout shoes with silver buckles: &ldquo;The des
      Grassins have not come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are they coming?&rdquo; asked the old notary, twisting his face, which had
      as many holes as a collander, into a queer grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answered Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your vintages all finished?&rdquo; said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all of them,&rdquo; said the old man, rising to walk up and down the room,
      his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, &ldquo;all of them.&rdquo; Through
      the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he saw la Grande Nanon
      sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing to spin there, so as
      not to intrude among the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon,&rdquo; he said, going into the passage, &ldquo;put out that fire and that
      candle, and come and sit with us. Pardieu! the hall is big enough for
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But monsieur, you are to have the great people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not you as good as they? They are descended from Adam, and so are
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet came back to the president and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sold your vintage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not I; I shall keep it. If the wine is good this year, it will be
      better two years hence. The proprietors, you know, have made an agreement
      to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won&rsquo;t get the better of
      us. Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once, faith! they&rsquo;ll come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but let us mind what we are about,&rdquo; said Grandet in a tone which
      made the president tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he driving some bargain?&rdquo; thought Cruchot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, and their
      arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun between Madame Grandet
      and the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, with
      pink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of the provinces
      and the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth until they are past
      forty. She was like the last rose of autumn,&mdash;pleasant to the eye,
      though the petals have a certain frostiness, and their perfume is slight.
      She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set the tone to Saumur, and
      gave parties. Her husband, formerly a quartermaster in the Imperial guard,
      who had been desperately wounded at Austerlitz, and had since retired,
      still retained, in spite of his respect for Grandet, the seeming frankness
      of an old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Grandet,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand and affecting a
      sort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots.
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to Madame
      Grandet, &ldquo;you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not know what
      to wish you.&rdquo; So saying, he offered her a little box which his servant had
      brought and which contained a Cape heather,&mdash;a flower lately imported
      into Europe and very rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed her hand,
      and said: &ldquo;Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners and
      seemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousand
      francs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to study law,
      now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering her a workbox
      with utensils in silver-gilt,&mdash;mere show-case trumpery, in spite of
      the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved, which belonged
      properly to something in better taste. As she opened it, Eugenie
      experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delights which make a
      young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure. She turned her eyes
      to her father as if to ask permission to accept it, and Monsieur Grandet
      replied: &ldquo;Take it, my daughter,&rdquo; in a tone which would have made an actor
      illustrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated look cast
      upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such riches were
      unheard-of. Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch of snuff, took
      one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on the ribbon of the Legion
      of honor which was attached to the button-hole of his blue surtout; then
      he looked at the Cruchots with an air that seemed to say, &ldquo;Parry that
      thrust if you can!&rdquo; Madame des Grassins cast her eyes on the blue vases
      which held the Cruchot bouquets, looking at the enemy&rsquo;s gifts with the
      pretended interest of a satirical woman. At this delicate juncture the
      Abbe Cruchot left the company seated in a circle round the fire and joined
      Grandet at the lower end of the hall. As the two men reached the embrasure
      of the farthest window the priest said in the miser&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;Those people
      throw money out of the windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?&rdquo; retorted the old
      wine-grower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have the means,&rdquo;
       said the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give her something better than scissors,&rdquo; answered Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew is a blockhead,&rdquo; thought the abbe as he looked at the
      president, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his brown
      countenance. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he have found some little trifle which cost money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet,&rdquo; said Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might have two tables, as we are all here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it is Eugenie&rsquo;s birthday you had better play loto all together,&rdquo; said
      Pere Grandet: &ldquo;the two young ones can join&rdquo;; and the old cooper, who never
      played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe. &ldquo;Come, Nanon, set
      the tables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon,&rdquo; said Madame des Grassins gaily,
      quite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never in my life been so pleased,&rdquo; the heiress said to her; &ldquo;I
      have never seen anything so pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it,&rdquo; Madame des Grassins
      whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! go on! damned intriguing thing!&rdquo; thought the president. &ldquo;If you
      ever have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hard with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, saying to
      himself: &ldquo;The des Grassins may do what they like; my property and my
      brother&rsquo;s and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundred thousand
      francs. The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that; besides, they
      have a daughter. They may give what presents they like; heiress and
      presents too will be ours one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out. Madame
      des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie. The actors in
      this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems, were provided
      with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors and numbered, and with
      counters of blue glass, and they appeared to be listening to the jokes of
      the notary, who never drew a number without making a remark, while in fact
      they were all thinking of Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s millions. The old cooper,
      with inward self-conceit, was contemplating the pink feathers and the
      fresh toilet of Madame des Grassins, the martial head of the banker, the
      faces of Adolphe, the president, the abbe, and the notary, saying to
      himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all after my money. Hey! neither the one nor the other shall
      have my daughter; but they are useful&mdash;useful as harpoons to fish
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallow
      candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon&rsquo;s
      spinning-wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother; this
      triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who, like
      certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was now lured and
      trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe,&mdash;all these
      things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy. Is it not,
      moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though here brought down to
      its simplest expression? The figure of Grandet, playing his own game with
      the false friendship of the two families and getting enormous profits from
      it, dominates the scene and throws light upon it. The modern god,&mdash;the
      only god in whom faith is preserved,&mdash;money, is here, in all its
      power, manifested in a single countenance. The tender sentiments of life
      hold here but a secondary place; only the three pure, simple hearts of
      Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her mother were inspired by them. And how much
      of ignorance there was in the simplicity of these poor women! Eugenie and
      her mother knew nothing of Grandet&rsquo;s wealth; they could only estimate the
      things of life by the glimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued
      nor despised money, because they were accustomed to do without it. Their
      feelings, bruised, though they did not know it, but ever-living, were the
      secret spring of their existence, and made them curious exceptions in the
      midst of these other people whose lives were purely material. Frightful
      condition of the human race! there is no one of its joys that does not
      come from some species of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Madame Grandet had won a loto of sixteen sous,&mdash;the
      largest ever pooled in that house,&mdash;and while la Grande Nanon was
      laughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, the
      knocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the women all
      jumped in their chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can they bang in that way!&rdquo; exclaimed Nanon; &ldquo;do they want to break
      in the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil is it?&rdquo; cried Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Nanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed by her
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandet! Grandet!&rdquo; cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear, and
      running to the door of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the players looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we all go?&rdquo; said Monsieur des Grassins; &ldquo;that knock strikes me as
      evil-intentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a young man,
      accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two large trunks
      and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandet turned roughly
      on his wife and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Grandet, go back to your loto; leave me to speak with monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pulled the door quickly to, and the excited players returned to
      their seats, but did not continue the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?&rdquo; asked his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is a traveller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have come from Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was two inches
      thick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock; the
      diligence of the Grand Bureau is never late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the gentleman young?&rdquo; inquired the Abbe Cruchot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Monsieur des Grassins, &ldquo;and he has brought luggage which
      must weigh nearly three tons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon does not come back,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be one of your relations,&rdquo; remarked the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on with our game,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet gently. &ldquo;I know from
      Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he would not
      like to find us talking of his affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Adolphe to his neighbor, &ldquo;it is no doubt your cousin
      Grandet,&mdash;a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ball of
      Monsieur de Nucingen.&rdquo; Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trod on his
      toes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on her stake, she
      whispered: &ldquo;Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps,
      together with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he was
      followed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filled the
      lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at this dwelling,
      and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, can only be likened
      to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introduction of a peacock into
      some village poultry-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down near the fire,&rdquo; said Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembled company
      very gracefully. The men rose to answer by a courteous inclination, and
      the women made a ceremonious bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cold, no doubt, monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet; &ldquo;you have,
      perhaps, travelled from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like all women!&rdquo; said the old wine-grower, looking up from a letter
      he was reading. &ldquo;Do let monsieur rest himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something,&rdquo; said
      Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got a tongue,&rdquo; said the old man sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all the others
      were well-used to the despotic ways of the master. However, after the two
      questions and the two replies had been exchanged, the newcomer rose,
      turned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so as to warm the sole
      of its boot, and said to Eugenie,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours. And,&rdquo; he added, looking at
      Grandet, &ldquo;I need nothing; I am not even tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has come from the capital?&rdquo; asked Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Charles,&mdash;such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet
      of Paris,&mdash;hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass,
      suspended by a chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine
      what was on the table, and also the persons sitting round it. He ogled
      Madame des Grassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after he had
      observed all he wished,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame. You are playing at loto, aunt,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Do not let me
      interrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was certain it was the cousin,&rdquo; thought Madame des Grassins, casting
      repeated glances at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-seven!&rdquo; cried the old abbe. &ldquo;Mark it down, Madame des Grassins.
      Isn&rsquo;t that your number?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife&rsquo;s card, who sat watching
      first the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, without thinking of her
      loto, a prey to mournful presentiments. From time to time the young heiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and the banker&rsquo;s wife easily
      detected a <i>crescendo</i> of surprise and curiosity in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two, presented at
      this moment a singular contrast to the worthy provincials, who,
      considerably disgusted by his aristocratic manners, were all studying him
      with sarcastic intent. This needs an explanation. At twenty-two, young
      people are still so near childhood that they often conduct themselves
      childishly. In all probability, out of every hundred of them fully
      ninety-nine would have behaved precisely as Monsieur Charles Grandet was
      now behaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spend
      several months with his uncle at Saumur. Perhaps Monsieur Grandet was
      thinking of Eugenie. Charles, sent for the first time in his life into the
      provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with the superiority of a
      man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement to despair by his
      luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing into those country
      regions all the refinements of Parisian life. In short, to explain it in
      one word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur in brushing his nails than
      he ever thought of doing in Paris, and to assume the extra nicety and
      elegance of dress which a young man of fashion often lays aside for a
      certain negligence which in itself is not devoid of grace. Charles
      therefore brought with him a complete hunting-costume, the finest gun, the
      best hunting-knife in the prettiest sheath to be found in all Paris. He
      brought his whole collection of waistcoats. They were of all kinds,&mdash;gray,
      black, white, scarabaeus-colored: some were shot with gold, some spangled,
      some <i>chined</i>; some were double-breasted and crossed like a shawl,
      others were straight in the collar; some had turned-over collars, some
      buttoned up to the top with gilt buttons. He brought every variety of
      collar and cravat in fashion at that epoch. He brought two of Buisson&rsquo;s
      coats and all his finest linen He brought his pretty gold toilet-set,&mdash;a
      present from his mother. He brought all his dandy knick-knacks, not
      forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to him by the most amiable of
      women,&mdash;amiable for him, at least,&mdash;a fine lady whom he called
      Annette and who at this moment was travelling, matrimonially and wearily,
      in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicions which required a passing
      sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was much pretty note-paper on which to
      write to her once a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it was
      possible for him to get together,&mdash;a collection of all the implements
      of husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from the
      little whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chased pistols
      which end it. His father having told him to travel alone and modestly, he
      had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself, rather pleased at not
      having to damage a delightful travelling-carriage ordered for a journey on
      which he was to meet his Annette, the great lady who, etc.,&mdash;whom he
      intended to rejoin at Baden in the following June. Charles expected to
      meet scores of people at his uncle&rsquo;s house, to hunt in his uncle&rsquo;s
      forests,&mdash;to live, in short, the usual chateau life; he did not know
      that his uncle was in Saumur, and had only inquired about him incidentally
      when asking the way to Froidfond. Hearing that he was in town, he supposed
      that he should find him in a suitable mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that he might make a becoming first appearance before his uncle
      either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most elegant
      travelling attire, simple yet exquisite,&mdash;&ldquo;adorable,&rdquo; to use the word
      which in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or a thing.
      At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnut locks; there
      he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat, which, combined with
      a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smiling countenance agreeably. A
      travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up, nipped in his waist and
      disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed in front, beneath which was another
      waistcoat of white material. His watch, negligently slipped into a pocket,
      was fastened by a short gold chain to a buttonhole. His gray trousers,
      buttoned up at the sides, were set off at the seams with patterns of black
      silk embroidery. He gracefully twirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did
      not mar the freshness of his gray gloves. And to complete all, his cap was
      in excellent taste. None but a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upper
      spheres, could thus array himself without appearing ridiculous; none other
      could give the harmony of self-conceit to all these fopperies, which were
      carried off, however, with a dashing air,&mdash;the air of a young man who
      has fine pistols, a sure aim, and Annette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincial party
      and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliance which the
      traveller&rsquo;s elegance cast among the gray shadows of the room and upon the
      faces of this family group,&mdash;endeavor to picture to your minds the
      Cruchots. All three took snuff, and had long ceased to repress the habit
      of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches which strewed the frills of
      their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases of their crumpled collars.
      Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropes as soon as they wound them
      about their throats. The enormous quantity of linen which allowed these
      people to have their clothing washed only once in six months, and to keep
      it during that time in the depths of their closets, also enabled time to
      lay its grimy and decaying stains upon it. There was perfect unison of
      ill-grace and senility about them; their faces, as faded as their
      threadbare coats, as creased as their trousers, were worn-out,
      shrivelled-up, and puckered. As for the others, the general negligence of
      their dress, which was incomplete and wanting in freshness,&mdash;like the
      toilet of all country places, where insensibly people cease to dress for
      others and come to think seriously of the price of a pair of gloves,&mdash;was
      in keeping with the negligence of the Cruchots. A horror of fashion was
      the only point on which the Grassinists and the Cruchotines agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strange accessories
      of this dwelling,&mdash;the joists of the ceiling, the color of the
      woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there in sufficient
      number to punctuate the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia of Sciences,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      loto-players lifted their noses and looked at him with as much curiosity
      as they might have felt about a giraffe. Monsieur des Grassins and his
      son, to whom the appearance of a man of fashion was not wholly unknown,
      were nevertheless as much astonished as their neighbors, whether it was
      that they fell under the indefinable influence of the general feeling, or
      that they really shared it as with satirical glances they seemed to say to
      their compatriots,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you see in Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing to
      displease the master of the house. Grandet was absorbed in the long letter
      which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the only candle
      upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or their pleasure.
      Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dress or of person,
      was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousin a being descended
      from seraphic spheres. She inhaled with delight the fragrance wafted from
      the graceful curls of that brilliant head. She would have liked to touch
      the soft kid of the delicate gloves. She envied Charles his small hands,
      his complexion, the freshness and refinement of his features. In short,&mdash;if
      it is possible to sum up the effect this elegant being produced upon an
      ignorant young girl perpetually employed in darning stockings or in
      mending her father&rsquo;s clothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these
      unclean rafters, seeing none but occasional passers along the silent
      street,&mdash;this vision of her cousin roused in her soul an emotion of
      delicate desire like that inspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures
      of women drawn by Westall for the English &ldquo;Keepsakes,&rdquo; and that engraved
      by the Findens with so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon the
      paper, that the celestial apparitions may be wafted away. Charles drew
      from his pocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady now
      travelling in Scotland. As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, done in
      the vacant hours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousin to see
      if it were possible that he meant to make use of it. The manners of the
      young man, his gestures, the way in which he took up his eye-glass, his
      affected superciliousness, his contemptuous glance at the coffer which had
      just given so much pleasure to the rich heiress, and which he evidently
      regarded as without value, or even as ridiculous,&mdash;all these things,
      which shocked the Cruchots and the des Grassins, pleased Eugenie so deeply
      that before she slept she dreamed long dreams of her phoenix cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game came
      suddenly to an end. La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: &ldquo;Madame, I want
      the sheets for monsieur&rsquo;s bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet followed her out. Madame des Grassins said in a low voice:
      &ldquo;Let us keep our sous and stop playing.&rdquo; Each took his or her two sous
      from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then the party moved
      in a body toward the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished your game?&rdquo; said Grandet, without looking up from his
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl
      when sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and help
      her mother and Nanon. Had an able confessor then questioned her she would,
      no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither of her mother nor of
      Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to look after her cousin&rsquo;s
      room and concern herself with her cousin; to supply what might be needed,
      to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all was done to make it, as far
      as possible, suitable and elegant; and, in fact, she arrived in time to
      prove to her mother and Nanon that everything still remained to be done.
      She put into Nanon&rsquo;s head the notion of passing a warming-pan between the
      sheets. She herself covered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon
      to change it every morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary
      to light a good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood
      into the corridor without saying anything to her father. She ran to get,
      from one of the corner-shelves of the hall, a tray of old lacquer which
      was part of the inheritance of the late Monsieur de la Bertelliere,
      catching up at the same time a six-sided crystal goblet, a little
      tarnished gilt spoon, an antique flask engraved with cupids, all of which
      she put triumphantly on the corner of her cousin&rsquo;s chimney-piece. More
      ideas surged through her head in one quarter of an hour than she had ever
      had since she came into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallow
      candle; suppose we buy a wax one?&rdquo; And she darted, swift as a bird, to get
      the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthly expenses.
      &ldquo;Here, Nanon,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will your father say?&rdquo; This terrible remonstrance was uttered by
      Madame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old Sevres
      sugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau of Froidfond.
      &ldquo;And where will you get the sugar? Are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of <i>eau sucree</i>?
      Besides, he will not notice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father sees everything,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanon hesitated; she knew her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nanon, go,&mdash;because it is my birthday.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Nanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her young
      mistress had ever made, and then obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroom assigned
      by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was the object of
      Madame des Grassins&rsquo; attentions; to all appearances she was setting her
      cap at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very courageous, monsieur,&rdquo; she said to the young dandy, &ldquo;to
      leave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up your abode
      in Saumur. But if we do not frighten you away, you will find there are
      some amusements even here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put so much
      prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them the prudish
      concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom all pleasure is
      either a theft or an error. Charles was so completely out of his element
      in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and the sumptuous life
      with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as he looked at Madame
      des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisian faces. He gracefully
      responded to the species of invitation addressed to him, and began very
      naturally a conversation, in which Madame des Grassins gradually lowered
      her voice so as to bring it into harmony with the nature of the
      confidences she was making. With her, as with Charles, there was the need
      of conference; so after a few moments spent in coquettish phrases and a
      little serious jesting, the clever provincial said, thinking herself
      unheard by the others, who were discussing the sale of wines which at that
      season filled the heads of every one in Saumur,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you will give as
      much pleasure to my husband as to myself. Our salon is the only one in
      Saumur where you will find the higher business circles mingling with the
      nobility. We belong to both societies, who meet at our house simply
      because they find it amusing. My husband&mdash;I say it with pride&mdash;is
      as much valued by the one class as by the other. We will try to relieve
      the monotony of your visit here. If you stay all the time with Monsieur
      Grandet, good heavens! what will become of you? Your uncle is a sordid
      miser who thinks of nothing but his vines; your aunt is a pious soul who
      can&rsquo;t put two ideas together; and your cousin is a little fool, without
      education, perfectly common, no fortune, who will spend her life in
      darning towels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is really very nice, this woman,&rdquo; thought Charles Grandet as he duly
      responded to Madame des Grassins&rsquo; coquetries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,&rdquo; said
      the stout banker, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this remark the notary and the president said a few words that were
      more or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, brought
      their thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as he
      handed round his snuff-box: &ldquo;Who can do the honors of Saumur for monsieur
      so well as madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what do you mean by that, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe?&rdquo; demanded Monsieur des
      Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the town of
      Saumur, and for monsieur,&rdquo; said the wily old man, turning to Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles and Madame
      des Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to make
      free and easy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you remember me, but I had the honor
      of dancing as your <i>vis-a-vis</i> at a ball given by the Baron de
      Nucingen, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur,&rdquo; answered Charles, pleased to
      find himself the object of general attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is your son?&rdquo; he said to Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe looked at her maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were very young when you were in Paris?&rdquo; said Charles,
      addressing Adolphe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know, monsieur,&rdquo; said the abbe, &ldquo;that we send them to Babylon as
      soon as they are weaned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extreme
      penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only in the provinces,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you will find women of
      thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about to take
      his degree. I almost fancy myself back in the days when the young men
      stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame,&rdquo; said the abbe,
      turning to his female adversary. &ldquo;To me, your triumphs are but of
      yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old rogue!&rdquo; thought Madame Grassins; &ldquo;can he have guessed my
      intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur,&rdquo; thought
      Charles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into his waistcoat,
      and cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate the attitude which
      Chantrey has given to Lord Byron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, the
      preoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plunged
      him, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, who
      tried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptible
      motions of the miser&rsquo;s face, which was then under the full light of the
      candle. He maintained the habitual calm of his features with evident
      difficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves the countenance such a
      man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatal letter which here follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My Brother,&mdash;It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen
  each other. My marriage was the occasion of our last interview,
  after which we parted, and both of us were happy. Assuredly I
  could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the
  family whose prosperity you then predicted.

  When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer
  living. In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace
  of bankruptcy. I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the
  last moment, hoping to save myself. The end has come, I must sink
  into it. The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my
  notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing. I
  have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not
  more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them. The wines in
  my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the
  abundance and quality of your vintage. In three days Paris will
  cry out: &ldquo;Monsieur Grandet was a knave!&rdquo; and I, an honest man,
  shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy. I deprive my son of
  a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother,
  which I have lost. He knows nothing of all this,&mdash;my unfortunate
  child whom I idolize! We parted tenderly. He was ignorant,
  happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that
  farewell. Will he not some day curse me? My brother, my brother!
  the curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against
  ours, but theirs are irrevocable. Grandet, you are my elder
  brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles
  may cast no bitter words upon my grave! My brother, if I were
  writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I
  put into this letter,&mdash;nor as great, for then I should weep, I
  should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I
  suffer and look at death with dry eyes.

  From henceforth you are my son&rsquo;s father; he has no relations, as
  you well know, on his mother&rsquo;s side. Why did I not consider social
  prejudices? Why did I yield to love? Why did I marry the natural
  daughter of a great lord? Charles has no family. Oh, my unhappy
  son! my son! Listen, Grandet! I implore nothing for myself,
  &mdash;besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage
  of three millions,&mdash;but for my son! Brother, my suppliant hands
  are clasped as I think of you; behold them! Grandet, I confide my
  son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less
  pain as I think that you will be to him a father. He loved me
  well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will
  not curse me. Ah, you see! he is gentle, he is like his mother, he
  will cause you no grief. Poor boy! accustomed to all the
  enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which
  you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth. And I leave
  him ruined! alone! Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I
  who have brought this humiliation upon him! Would that I had the
  force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother&rsquo;s
  side! Madness! I come back to my disaster&mdash;to his. I send him to
  you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his
  future fate. Be a father to him, but a good father. Do not tear
  him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him. I beg him
  on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother&rsquo;s heir, he
  may have on my estate. But the prayer is superfluous; he is
  honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my
  creditors. Bring him to see this at the right time; reveal to him
  the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he
  still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is
  not lost for him. Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give
  him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he
  listens to his father&rsquo;s voice as it reaches him from the grave, he
  will go the Indies. My brother, Charles is an upright and
  courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his
  venture; he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you
  may lend him. Grandet! if you will not do this, you will lay up
  for yourself remorse. Ah, should my child find neither tenderness
  nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon
  your cruelty!

  If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have
  had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother&rsquo;s
  property; but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything. I
  did not wish to die uncertain of my child&rsquo;s fate; I hoped to feel
  a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed
  my heart: but time fails me. While Charles is journeying to you I
  shall be preparing my assignment. I shall endeavor to show by the
  order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither
  from a faulty life nor from dishonesty. It is for my son&rsquo;s sake
  that I strive to do this.

  Farewell, my brother! May the blessing of God be yours for the
  generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you
  will accept. A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in
  that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read
  these lines.
</pre>
    <p>
      Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are talking?&rdquo; said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded the letter
      in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket. He looked at
      his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hid his feelings and
      his calculations. &ldquo;Have you warmed yourself?&rdquo; he said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoroughly, my dear uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are the women?&rdquo; said his uncle, already forgetting that his
      nephew was to sleep at the house. At this moment Eugenie and Madame
      Grandet returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the room all ready?&rdquo; said Grandet, recovering his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you your room.
      It isn&rsquo;t a dandy&rsquo;s room; but you will excuse a poor wine-grower who never
      has a penny to spare. Taxes swallow up everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not wish to intrude, Grandet,&rdquo; said the banker; &ldquo;you may want to
      talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow in keeping
      with his or her own character. The old notary went to the door to fetch
      his lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompany the des
      Grassins on their way. Madame des Grassins had not foreseen the incident
      which brought the evening prematurely to an end, her servant therefore had
      not arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?&rdquo; said the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe, but I have my son,&rdquo; she answered dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me,&rdquo; said the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Monsieur Cruchot&rsquo;s arm,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they were soon
      some distance in advance of the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good-looking young man, madame,&rdquo; he said, pressing her arm.
      &ldquo;Good-by to the grapes, the vintage is done. It is all over with us. We
      may as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet. Eugenie will belong to the
      dandy. Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman, your son
      Adolphe will find another rival in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe. This young man cannot fail to see that
      Eugenie is a little fool,&mdash;a girl without the least freshness. Did
      you notice her to-night? She was as yellow as a quince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not take the trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never take the
      trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; he will make
      his own comparisons, which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if you only <i>would</i>, madame&mdash;&rdquo; said the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe? Do you mean to offer
      me bad advice? I have not reached the age of thirty-nine, without a stain
      upon my reputation, thank God! to compromise myself now, even for the
      empire of the Great Mogul. You and I are of an age when we both know the
      meaning of words. For an ecclesiastic, you certainly have ideas that are
      very incongruous. Fie! it is worthy of Faublas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read Faublas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe; I meant to say the <i>Liaisons dangereuses</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that book is infinitely more moral,&rdquo; said the abbe, laughing. &ldquo;But
      you make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; I only meant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked things
      into my head? Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly clear? If this young man&mdash;who I
      admit is very good-looking&mdash;were to make love to me, he would not
      think of his cousin. In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves
      in this way to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we live in
      the provinces, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I do not want, and Adolphe himself would not want,
      a hundred millions brought at such a price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptation might be
      too great for either of us to withstand. Only, I do think that an honest
      woman may permit herself, in all honor, certain harmless little
      coquetries, which are, in fact, part of her social duty and which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each other?&mdash;Permit
      me to blow my nose.&mdash;I assure you, madame,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that the
      young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more flattering manner
      than he put on when he looked at me; but I forgive him for doing homage to
      beauty in preference to old age&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite apparent,&rdquo; said the president in his loud voice, &ldquo;that
      Monsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremely
      matrimonial intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in that case the cousin wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen among us like a
      cannon-ball,&rdquo; answered the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t prove anything,&rdquo; said Monsieur des Grassins; &ldquo;the old miser
      is always making mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner. You must
      go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys, with the
      beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course. I hope she will be properly
      dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a fright of her!
      Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,&rdquo; she added,
      stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are at home, madame,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returned home,
      applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, under all its
      aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedly changed the
      respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines. The admirable
      common-sense which guided all the actions of these great machinators made
      each side feel the necessity of a momentary alliance against a common
      enemy. Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie from loving her cousin, and
      the cousin from thinking of Eugenie? Could the Parisian resist the
      influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spoken calumnies, slanders
      full of faint praise and artless denials, which should be made to circle
      incessantly about him and deceive him?

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to his
      nephew,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go to bed. It is too late to talk about the matters which have
      brought you here; to-morrow we will take a suitable moment. We breakfast
      at eight o&rsquo;clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bit of bread, and
      drink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like the Parisians, at five
      o&rsquo;clock. That&rsquo;s the order of the day. If you like to go and see the town
      and the environs you are free to do so. You will excuse me if my
      occupations do not permit me to accompany you. You may perhaps hear people
      say that I am rich,&mdash;Monsieur Grandet this, Monsieur Grandet that. I
      let them talk; their gossip does not hurt my credit. But I have not a
      penny; I work in my old age like an apprentice whose worldly goods are a
      bad plane and two good arms. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll soon know yourself what a
      franc costs when you have got to sweat for it. Nanon, where are the
      candles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want,&rdquo; said Madame
      Grandet; &ldquo;but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, brought everything
      with me. Permit me to bid you good-night, and my young cousin also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon&rsquo;s hand,&mdash;an Anjou
      candle, very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow
      and deceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence
      under his roof, did not perceive this magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you the way,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under the archway,
      Grandet ceremoniously went through the passage which divided the hall from
      the kitchen. A swing-door, furnished with a large oval pane of glass, shut
      this passage from the staircase, so as to fend off the cold air which
      rushed through it. But the north wind whistled none the less keenly in
      winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at the bottom of the doors of the
      living-room, the temperature within could scarcely be kept at a proper
      height. Nanon went to bolt the outer door; then she closed the hall and
      let loose a wolf-dog, whose bark was so strangled that he seemed to have
      laryngitis. This animal, noted for his ferocity, recognized no one but
      Nanon; the two untutored children of the fields understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of the
      staircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fall of
      his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. He fancied
      himself in a hen-roost. His aunt and cousin, to whom he turned an
      inquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did not guess the
      cause of his amazement, and took the glance for an expression of
      friendliness, which they answered by a smile that made him desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>

      When they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted in Etruscan
      red and without casings,&mdash;doors sunk in the dusty walls and provided
      with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending with the pattern of
      a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of the lock. The first door
      at the top of the staircase, which opened into a room directly above the
      kitchen, was evidently walled up. In fact, the only entrance to that room
      was through Grandet&rsquo;s bedchamber; the room itself was his office. The
      single window which lighted it, on the side of the court, was protected by
      a lattice of strong iron bars. No one, not even Madame Grandet, had
      permission to enter it. The old man chose to be alone, like an alchemist
      in his laboratory. There, no doubt, some hiding-place had been ingeniously
      constructed; there the title-deeds of property were stored; there hung the
      scales on which to weigh the louis; there were devised, by night and
      secretly, the estimates, the profits, the receipts, so that business men,
      finding Grandet prepared at all points, imagined that he got his cue from
      fairies or demons; there, no doubt, while Nanon&rsquo;s loud snoring shook the
      rafters, while the wolf-dog watched and yawned in the courtyard, while
      Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper
      to cuddle, to con over, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold. The walls
      were thick, the screens sure. He alone had the key of this laboratory,
      where&mdash;so people declared&mdash;he studied the maps on which his
      fruit-trees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, and almost
      to a twig.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of Eugenie&rsquo;s chamber was opposite to the walled-up entrance to
      this room. At the other end of the landing were the appartements of the
      married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house. Madame Grandet
      had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through a glass
      door. The master&rsquo;s chamber was separated from that of his wife by a
      partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall. Pere
      Grandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the high mansarde attic
      which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hear him if the young
      man took it into his head to go and come. When Eugenie and her mother
      reached the middle of the landing they kissed each other for good-night;
      then with a few words of adieu to Charles, cold upon the lips, but
      certainly very warm in the heart of the young girl, they withdrew into
      their own chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are in your room, my nephew,&rdquo; said Pere Grandet as he opened the
      door. &ldquo;If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! the dog
      would eat you up without a word. Sleep well. Good-night. Ha! why, they
      have made you a fire!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something more!&rdquo; said Monsieur Grandet. &ldquo;Do you take my nephew for
      a lying-in woman? Carry off your brazier, Nanon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate as
      a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on, as you&rsquo;ve taken it into your head,&rdquo; said Grandet, pushing
      her by the shoulders; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t set things on fire.&rdquo; So saying, the miser
      went down-stairs, grumbling indistinct sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks. After casting his eyes on
      the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled with bouquets so
      well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbed stone whose very
      look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood with varnished cane seats
      that seemed to have more than the usual four angles, on the open
      night-table capacious enough to hold a small sergeant-at-arms, on the
      meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, on the tester whose cloth valance
      shook as if, devoured by moths, it was about to fall, he turned gravely to
      la Grande Nanon and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! my dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of Monsieur
      Grandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet of
      Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfect gentleman.
      Shall I help you to unpack your trunks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! yes, if you will, my old trooper. Didn&rsquo;t you serve in the marines
      of the Imperial Guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; laughed Nanon. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,&mdash;the marines of the guard?
      Is it salt? Does it go in the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of green
      silk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin! what a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for the parish
      church! My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, and you&rsquo;ll save
      your soul; if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll lose it. Oh, how nice you look in it! I
      must call mademoiselle to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed. I&rsquo;ll
      arrange my things to-morrow. If my dressing-gown pleases you so much, you
      shall save your soul. I&rsquo;m too good a Christian not to give it to you when
      I go away, and you can do what you like with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to put
      faith into his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Nanon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world have I come here for?&rdquo; thought Charles as he went to
      sleep. &ldquo;My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object. Pshaw!
      put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiot said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed Virgin! how charming he is, my cousin!&rdquo; Eugenie was saying,
      interrupting her prayers, which that night at least were never finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed. She heard the
      miser walking up and down his room through the door of communication which
      was in the middle of the partition. Like all timid women, she had studied
      the character of her lord. Just as the petrel foresees the storm, she knew
      by imperceptible signs when an inward tempest shook her husband; and at
      such times, to use an expression of her own, she &ldquo;feigned dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put to his
      sanctum, and said to himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! A fine legacy!
      I have not fifty francs to give him. What are fifty francs to a dandy who
      looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandet was
      perhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment of writing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have that golden robe,&rdquo; thought Nanon, who went to sleep tricked
      out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in her life of
      flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreaming of love.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicious
      hour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowers express
      their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upward to the brain
      their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into a vague desire,&mdash;day
      of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys! When babes begin to see, they
      smile; when a young girl first perceives the sentiment of nature, she
      smiles as she smiled when an infant. If light is the first love of life,
      is not love a light to the heart? The moment to see within the veil of
      earthly things had come for Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      An early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and said her
      prayers, and then began the business of dressing,&mdash;a business which
      henceforth was to have a meaning. First she brushed and smoothed her
      chestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her head with the
      utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, and giving to her
      head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of her face; for the
      simplicity of these accessories accorded well with the innocent sincerity
      of its lines. As she washed her hands again and again in the cold water
      which hardened and reddened the skin, she looked at her handsome round
      arms and asked herself what her cousin did to make his hands so softly
      white, his nails so delicately curved. She put on new stockings and her
      prettiest shoes. She laced her corset straight, without skipping a single
      eyelet. And then, wishing for the first time in her life to appear to
      advantage, she felt the joy of having a new gown, well made, which
      rendered her attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck the hour;
      to her astonishment, it was only seven. The desire of having plenty of
      time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early. Ignorant of
      the art of retouching every curl and studying every effect, Eugenie simply
      crossed her arms, sat down by the window, and looked at the court-yard,
      the narrow garden, and the high terraced walls that over-topped it: a
      dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet not wholly devoid of those mysterious
      beauties which belong to solitary or uncultivated nature. Near the kitchen
      was a well surrounded by a curb, with a pulley fastened to a bent iron rod
      clasped by a vine whose leaves were withered, reddened, and shrivelled by
      the season. From thence the tortuous shoots straggled to the wall,
      clutched it, and ran the whole length of the house, ending near the
      wood-pile, where the logs were ranged with as much precision as the books
      in a library. The pavement of the court-yard showed the black stains
      produced in time by lichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or
      friction. The thick walls wore a coating of green moss streaked with
      waving brown lines, and the eight stone steps at the bottom of the
      court-yard which led up to the gate of the garden were disjointed and
      hidden beneath tall plants, like the tomb of a knight buried by his widow
      in the days of the Crusades. Above a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling
      stones was a trellis of rotten wood, half fallen from decay; over them
      clambered and intertwined at will a mass of clustering creepers. On each
      side of the latticed gate stretched the crooked arms of two stunted
      apple-trees. Three parallel walks, gravelled and separated from each other
      by square beds, where the earth was held in by box-borders, made the
      garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of the old walls, in a group
      of lindens. At the farther end were raspberry-bushes; at the other, near
      the house, an immense walnut-tree drooped its branches almost into the
      window of the miser&rsquo;s sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of the
      Loire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid on
      these picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants which swathed
      the court-yard. Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect of things lately
      so insignificant to her. A thousand confused thoughts came to birth in her
      mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without along the wall. She felt
      that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable, which wraps the moral being
      as a cloud wraps the physical body. Her thoughts were all in keeping with
      the details of this strange landscape, and the harmonies of her heart
      blended with the harmonies of nature. When the sun reached an angle of the
      wall where the &ldquo;Venus-hair&rdquo; of southern climes drooped its thick leaves,
      lit with the changing colors of a pigeon&rsquo;s breast, celestial rays of hope
      illumined the future to her eyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon
      that piece of wall, on its pale flowers, its blue harebells, its wilting
      herbage, with which she mingled memories as tender as those of childhood.
      The noise made by each leaf as it fell from its twig in the void of that
      echoing court gave answer to the secret questionings of the young girl,
      who could have stayed there the livelong day without perceiving the flight
      of time. Then came tumultuous heavings of the soul. She rose often, went
      to her glass, and looked at herself, as an author in good faith looks at
      his work to criticise it and blame it in his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not beautiful enough for him!&rdquo; Such was Eugenie&rsquo;s thought,&mdash;a
      humble thought, fertile in suffering. The poor girl did not do herself
      justice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love&rsquo;s
      virtues. Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdy
      constitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whose beauties
      always seem a little vulgar; and yet, though she resembled the Venus of
      Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softer Christian
      sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it a distinction unknown to
      the sculptors of antiquity. She had an enormous head, with the masculine
      yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter of Phidias, and gray eyes, to which
      her chaste life, penetrating fully into them, carried a flood of light.
      The features of her round face, formerly fresh and rosy, were at one time
      swollen by the small-pox, which destroyed the velvet texture of the skin,
      though it kindly left no other traces, and her cheek was still so soft and
      delicate that her mother&rsquo;s kiss made a momentary red mark upon it. Her
      nose was somewhat too thick, but it harmonized well with the vermilion
      mouth, whose lips, creased in many lines, were full of love and kindness.
      The throat was exquisitely round. The bust, well curved and carefully
      covered, attracted the eye and inspired reverie. It lacked, no doubt, the
      grace which a fitting dress can bestow; but to a connoisseur the
      non-flexibility of her figure had its own charm. Eugenie, tall and
      strongly made, had none of the prettiness which pleases the masses; but
      she was beautiful with a beauty which the spirit recognizes, and none but
      artists truly love. A painter seeking here below for a type of Mary&rsquo;s
      celestial purity, searching womankind for those proud modest eyes which
      Raphael divined, for those virgin lines, often due to chances of
      conception, which the modesty of Christian life alone can bestow or keep
      unchanged,&mdash;such a painter, in love with his ideal, would have found
      in the face of Eugenie the innate nobleness that is ignorant of itself; he
      would have seen beneath the calmness of that brow a world of love; he
      would have felt, in the shape of the eyes, in the fall of the eyelids, the
      presence of the nameless something that we call divine. Her features, the
      contour of her head, which no expression of pleasure had ever altered or
      wearied, were like the lines of the horizon softly traced in the far
      distance across the tranquil lakes. That calm and rosy countenance,
      margined with light like a lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held
      the eye, and imparted the charm of the conscience that was there
      reflected. Eugenie was standing on the shore of life where young illusions
      flower, where daisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown;
      and thus she said, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet
      of love: &ldquo;I am too ugly; he will not notice me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase, and
      stretched out her neck to listen for the household noises. &ldquo;He is not up,&rdquo;
       she thought, hearing Nanon&rsquo;s morning cough as the good soul went and came,
      sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the dog, and speaking
      to the beasts in the stable. Eugenie at once went down and ran to Nanon,
      who was milking the cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin&rsquo;s breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday,&rdquo; said
      Nanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make cream. Your
      cousin is a darling, a darling! oh, that he is! You should have seen him
      in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold! I saw him, I did! He wears linen
      as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, please make us a <i>galette</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;ll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for the
      cakes?&rdquo; said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandet
      assumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and her
      mother. &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him for
      butter and flour and wood: he&rsquo;s your father, perhaps he&rsquo;ll give you some.
      See! there he is now, coming to give out the provisions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard the
      staircase shaking under her father&rsquo;s step. Already she felt the effects of
      that virgin modesty and that special consciousness of happiness which lead
      us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that our thoughts are graven on
      our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all. Perceiving for the first
      time the cold nakedness of her father&rsquo;s house, the poor girl felt a sort
      of rage that she could not put it in harmony with her cousin&rsquo;s elegance.
      She felt the need of doing something for him,&mdash;what, she did not
      know. Ingenuous and truthful, she followed her angelic nature without
      mistrusting her impressions or her feelings. The mere sight of her cousin
      had wakened within her the natural yearnings of a woman,&mdash;yearnings
      that were the more likely to develop ardently because, having reached her
      twenty-third year, she was in the plenitude of her intelligence and her
      desires. For the first time in her life her heart was full of terror at
      the sight of her father; in him she saw the master of the fate, and she
      fancied herself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding from his knowledge certain
      thoughts. She walked with hasty steps, surprised to breathe a purer air,
      to feel the sun&rsquo;s rays quickening her pulses, to absorb from their heat a
      moral warmth and a new life. As she turned over in her mind some stratagem
      by which to get the cake, a quarrel&mdash;an event as rare as the sight of
      swallows in winter&mdash;broke out between la Grande Nanon and Grandet.
      Armed with his keys, the master had come to dole out provisions for the
      day&rsquo;s consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any bread left from yesterday?&rdquo; he said to Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a crumb, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one of the
      flat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about to cut it,
      when Nanon said to him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are five, to-day, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;but your loaves weigh six pounds; there&rsquo;ll
      be some left. Besides, these young fellows from Paris don&rsquo;t eat bread,
      you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they must eat <i>frippe</i>?&rdquo; said Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Frippe</i> is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means any
      accompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, the commonest
      kind of <i>frippe</i>, to peach preserve, the most distinguished of all
      the <i>frippes</i>; those who in their childhood have licked the <i>frippe</i>
      and left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Grandet, &ldquo;they eat neither bread nor <i>frippe</i>; they
      are something like marriageable girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, the
      goodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was about to
      go towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I&rsquo;ll make a <i>galette</i>
      for the young ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog,&mdash;not
      more than you think yourself; for, look here, you&rsquo;ve only forked out six
      bits of sugar. I want eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Nanon? I have never seen you like this before. What have
      you got in your head? Are you the mistress here? You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have more
      than six pieces of sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With two pieces; I&rsquo;ll go without myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go without sugar at your age! I&rsquo;d rather buy you some out of my own
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind your own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet&rsquo;s eyes
      the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was always six
      francs a pound. The necessity of economizing it, acquired under the
      Empire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits. All women, even
      the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge to get their ends; Nanon
      abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the <i>galette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo; she called through the window, &ldquo;do you want some <i>galette</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nanon,&rdquo; said Grandet, hearing his daughter&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;See here.&rdquo; He
      opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful, and added
      a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall want wood for the oven,&rdquo; said the implacable Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take what you want,&rdquo; he answered sadly; &ldquo;but in that case you must
      make us a fruit-tart, and you&rsquo;ll cook the whole dinner in the oven. In
      that way you won&rsquo;t need two fires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; cried Nanon, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithful deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; she cried, when his back was turned, &ldquo;we shall have the <i>galette</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged a
      plateful on the kitchen-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just see, monsieur,&rdquo; said Nanon, &ldquo;what pretty boots your nephew has. What
      leather! why it smells good! What does he clean it with, I wonder? Am I to
      put your egg-polish on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather. Tell him you don&rsquo;t
      know how to black morocco; yes, that&rsquo;s morocco. He will get you something
      himself in Saumur to polish those boots with. I have heard that they put
      sugar into the blacking to make it shine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They look good to eat,&rdquo; said the cook, putting the boots to her nose.
      &ldquo;Bless me! if they don&rsquo;t smell like madame&rsquo;s eau-de-cologne. Ah! how
      funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; said her master. &ldquo;Do you call it funny to put more money into
      boots than the man who stands in them is worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, when Grandet returned the second time, after locking
      the fruit-garden, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you have the <i>pot-au-feu</i> put on once or
      twice a week on account of your nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to go to the butcher&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers will bring
      them. I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make the best soup
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool, Nanon. They eat what they can get, like the rest of the
      world. Don&rsquo;t we all live on the dead? What are legacies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out his watch,
      and seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of before breakfast, he
      took his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire? I have
      something to do there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then the father
      and daughter went down the winding street to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going at this early hour?&rdquo; said Cruchot, the notary,
      meeting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see something,&rdquo; answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinal
      appearance of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pere Grandet went to &ldquo;see something,&rdquo; the notary knew by experience
      there was something to be got by going with him; so he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Cruchot,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;you are one of my friends. I&rsquo;ll show you
      what folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for those that
      were in your fields down by the Loire, folly?&rdquo; said Maitre Cruchot,
      opening his eyes with amazement. &ldquo;What luck you have had! To cut down your
      trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood at Nantes, and to sell
      them at thirty francs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemn
      moment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring down upon
      her head a paternal and supreme sentence. Grandet had now reached the
      magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, where thirty
      workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, and levelling the
      spots formerly occupied by the poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean,&rdquo; he
      cried to a laborer, &ldquo;m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four times eight feet,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-two feet lost,&rdquo; said Grandet to Cruchot. &ldquo;I had three hundred
      poplars in this one line, isn&rsquo;t that so? Well, then, three h-h-hundred
      times thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay; add twice as
      much for the side rows,&mdash;fifteen hundred; the middle rows as much
      more. So we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Cruchot, to help out his friend; &ldquo;a thousand bales are
      worth about six hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there&rsquo;s three or four hundred francs
      on the second crop. Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelve thousand
      francs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comes to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say sixty thousand francs,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,&rdquo;
       continued Grandet, without stuttering: &ldquo;two thousand poplars forty years
      old will only yield me fifty thousand francs. There&rsquo;s a loss. I have found
      that myself,&rdquo; said Grandet, getting on his high horse. &ldquo;Jean, fill up all
      the holes except those at the bank of the river; there you are to plant
      the poplars I have bought. Plant &lsquo;em there, and they&rsquo;ll get nourishment
      from the government,&rdquo; he said, turning to Cruchot, and giving a slight
      motion to the wen on his nose, which expressed more than the most ironical
      of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil,&rdquo; said Cruchot,
      amazed at Grandet&rsquo;s calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-y-yes, monsieur,&rdquo; answered the old man satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, and paying no
      attention to her father&rsquo;s reckonings, presently turned an ear to the
      remarks of Cruchot when she heard him say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris. All Saumur is talking about
      your nephew. I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up, hey! Pere
      Grandet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that,&rdquo; said Grandet,
      accompanying the remark with a motion of his wen. &ldquo;Well, old c-c-comrade,
      I&rsquo;ll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-to know. I would rather,
      do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loire than g-g-give her to her
      c-c-cousin. You may t-t-tell that everywhere,&mdash;no, never mind; let
      the world t-t-talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light. The
      distant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real,
      tangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down and wilting
      on the earth. Since the previous evening she had attached herself to
      Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul to soul; from
      henceforth suffering was to rivet them. Is it not the noble destiny of
      women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of grief than by the
      splendors of fortune? How was it that fatherly feeling had died out of her
      father&rsquo;s heart? Of what crime had Charles been guilty? Mysterious
      questions! Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound, was wrapping
      itself in mystery. She walked back trembling in all her limbs; and when
      she reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous to her, she felt its
      sadness, she breathed the melancholy which time and events had printed
      there. None of love&rsquo;s lessons lacked. A few steps from their own door she
      went on before her father and waited at the threshold. But Grandet, who
      saw a newspaper in the notary&rsquo;s hand, stopped short and asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the Funds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never listen to my advice, Grandet,&rdquo; answered Cruchot. &ldquo;Buy soon; you
      will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting an excellent
      rate of interest,&mdash;five thousand a year for eighty thousand francs
      fifty centimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; answered Grandet, rubbing his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put the
      newspaper under his eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris,
  blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance
  at the Bourse. He had sent his resignation to the president of the
  Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a
  judge of the commercial courts. The failures of Monsieur Roguin
  and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.
  The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed
  were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary
  assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted
  that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,&rdquo;
   etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said the old wine-grower to the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who,
      notwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold running down
      his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possibly implored in
      vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his son, so joyous yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows nothing as yet,&rdquo; answered Grandet, with the same composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu! Monsieur Grandet,&rdquo; said Cruchot, who now understood the state of
      the case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering, Grandet found breakfast ready. Madame Grandet, round whose
      neck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quick effusion of
      feeling often caused by secret grief, was already seated in her chair on
      castors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can begin to eat,&rdquo; said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at a
      time; &ldquo;the young one is sleeping like a cherub. Isn&rsquo;t he a darling with
      his eyes shut? I went in and I called him: no answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him sleep,&rdquo; said Grandet; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll wake soon enough to hear
      ill-tidings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two little bits
      of sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miser amused
      himself by cutting up in his leisure hours. Madame Grandet, who did not
      dare to put the question, gazed at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father has blown his brains out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle?&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor indeed!&rdquo; said Grandet; &ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t worth a sou!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! poor boy, and he&rsquo;s sleeping like the king of the world!&rdquo; said Nanon
      in a gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie stopped eating. Her heart was wrung, as the young heart is wrung
      when pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for the first
      time, the whole being of a woman. The poor girl wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying about? You didn&rsquo;t know your uncle,&rdquo; said her father,
      giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtless threw upon his
      piles of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; said Nanon, &ldquo;who wouldn&rsquo;t feel pity for the poor young
      man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak to you, Nanon. Hold your tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be able to
      hide her feelings. She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will say nothing to him about it, Ma&rsquo;ame Grandet, till I return,&rdquo;
       said the old man. &ldquo;I have to go and straighten the line of my hedge along
      the high-road. I shall be back at noon, in time for the second breakfast,
      and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs. As for you,
      Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying, that&rsquo;s
      enough, child. He&rsquo;s going off like a shot to the Indies. You will never
      see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on with his
      usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers of both hands
      together, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I am suffocating!&rdquo; cried Eugenie when she was alone with her
      mother; &ldquo;I have never suffered like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let her
      breathe fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel better!&rdquo; said Eugenie after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calm and
      cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter with the
      sympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for the objects of
      their tenderness, and guessed all. In truth the life of the Hungarian
      sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely have been
      more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,&mdash;always together
      in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the same
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie&rsquo;s head and laying it
      upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother by a
      look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why send him to the Indies?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If he is unhappy, ought he not to
      stay with us? Is he not our nearest relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: we must
      respect them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon her raised
      seat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up their work.
      Swelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding her mother had
      given her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are, my kind mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn and blighted
      as it was by many sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like him?&rdquo; asked Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet only smiled in reply. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, she
      said in a low voice: &ldquo;Do you love him already? That is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; said Eugenie. &ldquo;Why is it wrong? You are pleased with him, Nanon
      is pleased with him; why should he not please me? Come, mamma, let us set
      the table for his breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying, &ldquo;Foolish
      child!&rdquo; But she sanctioned the child&rsquo;s folly by sharing it. Eugenie called
      Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want now, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, can we have cream by midday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! midday, to be sure you can,&rdquo; answered the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur des Grassins
      say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris. Put in a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I to get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose monsieur meets me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to his fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run, then. But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magi had
      come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle. All the town will know
      our goings-on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your father finds it out,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, &ldquo;he is capable of
      beating us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven. Nanon put on her
      hood and went off. Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, and went to
      fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself by hanging on a
      string across the attic; she walked softly along the corridor, so as not
      to waken her cousin, and she could not help listening at the door to his
      quiet breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorrow is watching while he sleeps,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes as
      coquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placed it
      triumphantly on the table. She laid hands on the pears counted out by her
      father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves. She went and came,
      and skipped and ran. She would have liked to lay under contribution
      everything in her father&rsquo;s house; but the keys were in his pocket. Nanon
      came back with two fresh eggs. At sight of them Eugenie almost hugged her
      round the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The farmer from Lande had them in his basket. I asked him for them, and
      he gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0006" id="link2H_4_0006">

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      After two hours&rsquo; thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped up twenty
      times from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to go and listen
      to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded in preparing a
      simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which, nevertheless,
      departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of the house. The midday
      breakfast was always taken standing. Each took a slice of bread, a little
      fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine. As Eugenie looked at the table
      drawn up near the fire with an arm-chair placed before her cousin&rsquo;s plate,
      at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-cup, the bottle of white wine, the
      bread, and the sugar heaped up in a saucer, she trembled in all her limbs
      at the mere thought of the look her father would give her if he should
      come in at that moment. She glanced often at the clock to see if her
      cousin could breakfast before the master&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take it all
      upon myself,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie could not repress a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good mother!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I have never loved you enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singing to
      himself, now came down. Happily, it was only eleven o&rsquo;clock. The true
      Parisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he were in the
      chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. He came into the
      room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming to youth, which made
      Eugenie&rsquo;s heart beat with mournful joy. He had taken the destruction of
      his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to his aunt gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you slept well, dear aunt? and you, too, my cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, monsieur; did you?&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be hungry, cousin,&rdquo; said Eugenie; &ldquo;will you take your seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then. However, I
      fared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once.
      Besides&mdash;&rdquo; here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made.
      &ldquo;Dear me! I am early, it is only eleven o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early?&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order. Well, I shall be glad to
      have anything to eat,&mdash;anything, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what, a chicken, a
      partridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A partridge!&rdquo; whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly have given
      the whole of her little hoard for a partridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down,&rdquo; said his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a pretty
      woman falls gracefully upon a sofa. Eugenie and her mother took ordinary
      chairs and sat beside him, near the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always live here?&rdquo; said Charles, thinking the room uglier by
      daylight than it had seemed the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; answered Eugenie, looking at him, &ldquo;except during the vintage.
      Then we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye des Noyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever take walks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine,&rdquo; said Madame
      Grandet, &ldquo;we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch the haymakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the theatre!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Grandet, &ldquo;see a play! Why, monsieur,
      don&rsquo;t you know it is a mortal sin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, monsieur,&rdquo; said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, &ldquo;here are your
      chickens,&mdash;in the shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! fresh eggs,&rdquo; said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to luxury,
      had already forgotten about his partridge, &ldquo;that is delicious: now, if you
      will give me the butter, my good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Butter! then you can&rsquo;t have the <i>galette</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, bring the butter,&rdquo; cried Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as much
      pleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtue
      triumph. Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, and trained
      by a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppish movements of a
      coxcomb. The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of a young girl possess
      a power that is actually magnetic; so that Charles, finding himself the
      object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin, could not escape the
      influence of feelings which flowed towards him, as it were, and inundated
      him. He gave Eugenie a bright, caressing look full of kindness,&mdash;a
      look which seemed itself a smile. He perceived, as his eyes lingered upon
      her, the exquisite harmony of features in the pure face, the grace of her
      innocent attitude, the magic clearness of the eyes, where young love
      sparkled and desire shone unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assure you
      my aunt&rsquo;s words would come true,&mdash;you would make the men commit the
      mortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The compliment went to Eugenie&rsquo;s heart and set it beating, though she did
      not understand its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! cousin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are laughing at a poor little country girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; it
      withers the heart and jars upon all my feelings.&rdquo; Here he swallowed his
      buttered sippet very gracefully. &ldquo;No, I really have not enough mind to
      make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. In Paris, when
      they want to disparage a man, they say: &lsquo;He has a good heart.&rsquo; The phrase
      means: &lsquo;The poor fellow is as stupid as a rhinoceros.&rsquo; But as I am rich,
      and known to hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye at thirty paces with any kind of pistol,
      and even in the open fields, ridicule respects me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a very pretty ring,&rdquo; said Eugenie; &ldquo;is there any harm in asking
      to see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenie blushed as
      she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! there&rsquo;s a lot of gold!&rdquo; said Nanon, bringing in the coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to an oblong
      pot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged with a fringe of
      ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds were bubbling up and
      falling in the boiling liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is boiled coffee,&rdquo; said Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of my visit
      here. You are indeed behind the age! I must teach you to make good coffee
      in a Chaptal coffee-pot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious! if there are so many things as all that to do,&rdquo; said Nanon, &ldquo;we
      may as well give up our lives to it. I shall never make coffee that way; I
      know that! Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cow while I make the
      coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make it,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fall upon
      the unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, and looked at him
      with an air of commiseration that caught his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything the matter, my cousin?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer; &ldquo;you
      know, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak to monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say Charles,&rdquo; said young Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are called Charles? What a beautiful name!&rdquo; cried Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presentiments of evil are almost always justified. At this moment Nanon,
      Madame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinking with a
      shudder of the old man&rsquo;s return, heard the knock whose echoes they knew
      but too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s papa!&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on the
      table-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up like a
      frightened hare. It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, who was
      wholly unable to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what is the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has come,&rdquo; answered Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table, upon
      Charles, and saw the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! so you have been making a feast for your nephew; very good, very
      good, very good indeed!&rdquo; he said, without stuttering. &ldquo;When the cat&rsquo;s
      away, the mice will play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feast!&rdquo; thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining the rules
      and customs of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my glass, Nanon,&rdquo; said the master
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie brought the glass. Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with a big
      blade from his breeches&rsquo; pocket, cut a slice of bread, took a small bit of
      butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate it standing. At this
      moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee. Pere Grandet saw the bits of
      sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale, and made three steps forward;
      he leaned down to the poor woman&rsquo;s ear and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get all that sugar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon fetched it from Fessard&rsquo;s; there was none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women took in
      this mute scene. Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking into the
      room to see what would happen. Charles, having tasted his coffee, found it
      bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet had already put
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put in more milk,&rdquo; answered the master of the house; &ldquo;your coffee will
      taste sweeter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it on the
      table, looking calmly at her father as she did so. Most assuredly, the
      Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms to facilitate
      the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage than Eugenie displayed
      when she replaced the sugar upon the table. The lover rewarded his
      mistress when she proudly showed him her beautiful bruised arm, and bathed
      every swollen vein with tears and kisses till it was cured with happiness.
      Charles, on the other hand, never so much as knew the secret of the cruel
      agitation that shook and bruised the heart of his cousin, crushed as it
      was by the look of the old miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not eating your breakfast, wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a piece of
      bread, and took a pear. Eugenie boldly offered her father some grapes,
      saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taste my preserves, papa. My cousin, you will eat some, will you not? I
      went to get these pretty grapes expressly for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew. When you
      have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something to tell you
      which can&rsquo;t be sweetened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the young man
      could not mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you mean, uncle? Since the death of my poor mother&rdquo;&mdash;at
      these words his voice softened&mdash;&ldquo;no other sorrow can touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?&rdquo; said
      his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your nonsense beginning. I am
      sorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew&rdquo;; and he showed the
      shoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his own arms.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces. You&rsquo;ve been
      brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make the purses we
      keep our money in. A bad look-out! Very bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, uncle? I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I understand a single word of
      what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last of his
      wine, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin, take courage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles&rsquo;s heart, and he
      followed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts. Eugenie, her
      mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible curiosity
      to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take place in the
      garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of the nephew.
      Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charles of the death of
      his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion in knowing him to be
      without a penny, and he sought for some phrase or formula by which to
      soften the communication of that cruel truth. &ldquo;You have lost your father,&rdquo;
       seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers die before their children.
      But &ldquo;you are absolutely without means,&rdquo;&mdash;all the misfortunes of life
      were summed up in those words! Grandet walked round the garden three
      times, the gravel crunching under his heavy step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the locality where
      joys or sorrows overwhelm us. Charles noticed with minute attention the
      box-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves as they fluttered
      down, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees,&mdash;picturesque
      details which were destined to remain forever in his memory, blending
      eternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusively to the passions, with
      the recollections of this solemn hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very fine weather, very warm,&rdquo; said Grandet, drawing a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle; but why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lad,&rdquo; answered his uncle, &ldquo;I have some bad news to give you.
      Your father is ill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why am I here?&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;Nanon,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;order post-horses!
      I can get a carriage somewhere?&rdquo; he added, turning to his uncle, who stood
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horses and carriages are useless,&rdquo; answered Grandet, looking at Charles,
      who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed. &ldquo;Yes, my poor boy, you guess
      the truth,&mdash;he is dead. But that&rsquo;s nothing; there is something worse:
      he blew out his brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s not the worst; the newspapers are all talking about it.
      Here, read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust the paper
      under his nephew&rsquo;s eyes. The poor young man, still a child, still at an
      age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; thought Grandet; &ldquo;his eyes frightened me. He&rsquo;ll be all
      right if he weeps,&mdash;That is not the worst, my poor nephew,&rdquo; he said
      aloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, &ldquo;that is nothing; you will
      get over it: but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never! My father! Oh, my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has ruined you, you haven&rsquo;t a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter? My father! Where is my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls and reverberated in
      the echoes. The three women, filled with pity, wept also; for tears are
      often as contagious as laughter. Charles, without listening further to his
      uncle, ran through the court and up the staircase to his chamber, where he
      threw himself across the bed and hid his face in the sheets, to weep in
      peace for his lost parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first burst must have its way,&rdquo; said Grandet, entering the
      living-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed their seats
      and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes. &ldquo;But that
      young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up with the dead
      than with his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie shuddered as she heard her father&rsquo;s comment on the most sacred of
      all griefs. From that moment she began to judge him. Charles&rsquo;s sobs,
      though muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; and his deep
      groans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, only ceased towards
      evening, after growing gradually feebler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatal exclamation! Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and at the
      sugar-bowl. He recollected the extraordinary breakfast prepared for the
      unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he said, with his usual composure. &ldquo;I hope that you will
      not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet. I don&rsquo;t give you MY money
      to stuff that young fellow with sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; said Eugenie; &ldquo;it was I who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because you are of age,&rdquo; said Grandet, interrupting his daughter,
      &ldquo;that you choose to contradict me? Remember, Eugenie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta!&rdquo; exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones; &ldquo;the son
      of my brother this, my nephew that! Charles is nothing at all to us; he
      hasn&rsquo;t a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandy has cried
      his fill, off he goes from here. I won&rsquo;t have him revolutionize my
      household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is &lsquo;failing,&rsquo; father?&rdquo; asked Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fail,&rdquo; answered her father, &ldquo;is to commit the most dishonorable action
      that can disgrace a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a great sin,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, &ldquo;and our brother may be
      damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t begin with your litanies!&rdquo; said Grandet, shrugging
      his shoulders. &ldquo;To fail, Eugenie,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;is to commit a theft which
      the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection. People have given
      their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to his reputation for honor
      and integrity; he has made away with it all, and left them nothing but
      their eyes to weep with. A highway robber is better than a bankrupt: the
      one attacks you and you can defend yourself, he risks his own life; but
      the other&mdash;in short, Charles is dishonored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words rang in the poor girl&rsquo;s heart and weighed it down with their
      heavy meaning. Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths of a
      forest, she knew nothing of the world&rsquo;s maxims, of its deceitful arguments
      and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrocious explanation
      which her father gave her designedly, concealing the distinction which
      exists between an involuntary failure and an intentional one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother did not consult me. Besides, he owes four millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a &lsquo;million,&rsquo; father?&rdquo; she asked, with the simplicity of a child
      which thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million?&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;why, it is a million pieces of twenty sous
      each, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Eugenie, &ldquo;how could my uncle possibly have had four
      millions? Is there any one else in France who ever had so many millions?&rdquo;
       Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemed to dilate. &ldquo;But
      what will become of my cousin Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going off to the West Indies by his father&rsquo;s request, and he will
      try to make his fortune there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he got the money to go with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall pay for his journey as far as&mdash;yes, as far as Nantes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie sprang into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, how good you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed of himself,
      for his conscience galled him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it take much time to amass a million?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said the old miser, &ldquo;you know what a napoleon is? Well, it
      takes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, we must say a great many <i>neuvaines</i> for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking so,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way, always spending my money!&rdquo; cried the father. &ldquo;Do you
      think there are francs on every bush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others, echoed
      through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenie and her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself,&rdquo; said Grandet.
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he added, looking at his wife and daughter, who had turned
      pale at his words, &ldquo;no nonsense, you two! I must leave you; I have got to
      see about the Dutchmen who are going away to-day. And then I must find
      Cruchot, and talk with him about all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed. As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her mother
      breathed more freely. Until this morning the young girl had never felt
      constrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hours
      every moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs,
      sometimes two hundred,&mdash;at least, so I&rsquo;ve heard say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then papa must be rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is. But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond two years
      ago; that may have pinched him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father&rsquo;s
      fortune, stopped short in her calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even see me, the darling!&rdquo; said Nanon, coming back from her
      errand. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like the
      Madeleine, and that&rsquo;s a blessing! What&rsquo;s the matter with the poor dear
      young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of her
      daughter&rsquo;s voice. Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman. The two,
      with beating hearts, went up to Charles&rsquo;s room. The door was open. The
      young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he only uttered
      inarticulate cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he loves his father!&rdquo; said Eugenie in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopes of
      a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate. Madame
      Grandet cast a mother&rsquo;s look upon her daughter, and then whispered in her
      ear,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, you will love him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him!&rdquo; answered Eugenie. &ldquo;Ah! if you did but know what my father said
      to Monsieur Cruchot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost my father, my poor father! If he had told me his secret
      troubles we might have worked together to repair them. My God! my poor
      father! I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed him
      quite coldly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobs cut short the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will pray for him,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet. &ldquo;Resign yourself to the will
      of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Eugenie, &ldquo;take courage! Your loss is irreparable; therefore
      think only of saving your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mind into
      all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation, Eugenie sought
      to cheat her cousin&rsquo;s grief by turning his thoughts inward upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My honor?&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with an
      impatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms. &ldquo;Ah! that
      is true. My uncle said my father had failed.&rdquo; He uttered a heart-rending
      cry, and hid his face in his hands. &ldquo;Leave me, leave me, cousin! My God!
      my God! forgive my father, for he must have suffered sorely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something terribly attractive in the sight of this young sorrow,
      sincere without reasoning or afterthought. It was a virgin grief which the
      simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted to comprehend, and
      they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him to himself. They went
      downstairs in silence and took their accustomed places by the window and
      sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging a word. Eugenie had seen in
      the furtive glance that she cast about the young man&rsquo;s room&mdash;that
      girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling of an eye&mdash;the pretty
      trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, his razors embossed with gold.
      This gleam of luxury across her cousin&rsquo;s grief only made him the more
      interesting to her, possibly by way of contrast. Never before had so
      serious an event, so dramatic a sight, touched the imaginations of these
      two passive beings, hitherto sunk in the stillness and calm of solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Eugenie, &ldquo;we must wear mourning for my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father will decide that,&rdquo; answered Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They relapsed into silence. Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniform
      motion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of her
      meditation. The first desire of the girl&rsquo;s heart was to share her cousin&rsquo;s
      mourning.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      About four o&rsquo;clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on the heart
      of Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can have happened to your father?&rdquo; she said to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet entered joyously. After taking off his gloves, he rubbed his hands
      hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis had not been
      tanned and cured like Russia leather,&mdash;saving, of course, the perfume
      of larch-trees and incense. Presently his secret escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said, without stuttering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve trapped them all! Our wine is
      sold! The Dutch and the Belgians have gone. I walked about the
      market-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing. That
      Belgian fellow&mdash;you know who I mean&mdash;came up to me. The owners
      of all the good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending to
      wait; well, I didn&rsquo;t hinder them. The Belgian was in despair; I saw that.
      In a minute the bargain was made. He takes my vintage at two hundred
      francs the puncheon, half down. He paid me in gold; the notes are drawn.
      Here are six louis for you. In three months wines will have fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless so
      bitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at this moment
      in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the sale Grandet had
      just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them. Their panic would
      have brought the price of wines down fifty per cent at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression of the
      old miser&rsquo;s joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, you can easily help Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he saw the
      <i>Mene-Tekel-Upharsin</i> before his eyes is not to be compared with the
      cold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now found him
      enshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Ever since that dandy put foot in <i>my</i> house everything
      goes wrong! You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums and make
      feasts and weddings. I won&rsquo;t have that sort of thing. I hope I know my
      duty at my time of life! I certainly sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t take lessons from my
      daughter, or from anybody else. I shall do for my nephew what it is proper
      to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it. As for you,
      Eugenie,&rdquo; he added, facing her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak of this again, or I&rsquo;ll send
      you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don&rsquo;t; and no later than
      to-morrow either, if you disobey me! Where is that fellow, has he come
      down yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; answered Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is weeping for his father,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say; after all,
      he was a father. He made a couple of turns up and down the room, and then
      went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investment he was
      meditating in the public Funds. The thinning out of his two thousand acres
      of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand francs: putting this
      sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars and to his other gains
      for the last year and for the current year, he had amassed a total of nine
      hundred thousand francs, without counting the two hundred thousand he had
      got by the sale just concluded. The twenty per cent which Cruchot assured
      him would gain in a short time from the Funds, then quoted at seventy,
      tempted him. He figured out his calculation on the margin of the newspaper
      which gave the account of his brother&rsquo;s death, all the while hearing the
      moans of his nephew, but without listening to them. Nanon came and knocked
      on the wall to summon him to dinner. On the last step of the staircase he
      was saying to himself as he came down,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest. In two years I shall
      have fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in good
      gold,&mdash;Well, where&rsquo;s my nephew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to eat,&rdquo; answered Nanon; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not
      good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much saved,&rdquo; retorted her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! he won&rsquo;t cry long. Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was eaten in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, &ldquo;we
      must put on mourning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spend money
      on? Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commands us
      to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy your mourning out of your six louis. Give me a hat-band; that&rsquo;s
      enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word. Her generous
      instincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly and for the
      first time awakened, were galled at every turn. The evening passed to all
      appearance like a thousand other evenings of their monotonous life, yet it
      was certainly the most horrible. Eugenie sewed without raising her head,
      and did not use the workbox which Charles had despised the night before.
      Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves. Grandet twirled his thumbs for four
      hours, absorbed in calculations whose results were on the morrow to
      astonish Saumur. No one came to visit the family that day. The whole town
      was ringing with the news of the business trick just played by Grandet,
      the failure of his brother, and the arrival of his nephew. Obeying the
      desire to gossip over their mutual interests, all the upper and
      middle-class wine-growers in Saumur met at Monsieur des Grassins, where
      terrible imprecations were being fulminated against the ex-mayor. Nanon
      was spinning, and the whirr of her wheel was the only sound heard beneath
      the gray rafters of that silent hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t waste our tongues,&rdquo; she said, showing her teeth, as large and
      white as peeled almonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing should be wasted,&rdquo; answered Grandet, rousing himself from his
      reverie. He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and he was
      sailing along that sheet of gold. &ldquo;Let us go to bed. I will bid my nephew
      good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will take anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear the
      conversation that was about to take place between the goodman and his
      nephew. Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nephew, you are in trouble. Yes, weep, that&rsquo;s natural. A father is
      a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently. I am a good uncle to
      you, remember that. Come, take courage! Will you have a little glass of
      wine?&rdquo; (Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offer it as tea is offered
      in China.) &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; added Grandet, &ldquo;you have got no light! That&rsquo;s bad, very
      bad; you ought to see what you are about,&rdquo; and he walked to the
      chimney-piece. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A wax candle! How the devil did
      they filch a wax candle? The spendthrifts would tear down the ceilings of
      my house to boil the fellow&rsquo;s eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms and
      burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice getting back
      to their holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?&rdquo; said the man, coming into the
      chamber of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers,&rdquo; said the poor mother in a
      trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take your good God!&rdquo; growled Grandet in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Misers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all in all.
      This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in which, far
      more than at any former period, money sways the laws and politics and
      morals. Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, all conspire to undermine
      belief in a future life,&mdash;a belief upon which the social edifice has
      rested for eighteen hundred years. The grave, as a means of transition, is
      little feared in our day. The future, which once opened to us beyond the
      requiems, has now been imported into the present. To obtain <i>per fas et
      nefas</i> a terrestrial paradise of luxury and earthly enjoyment, to
      harden the heart and macerate the body for the sake of fleeting
      possessions, as the martyrs once suffered all things to reach eternal
      joys, this is now the universal thought&mdash;a thought written
      everywhere, even in the very laws which ask of the legislator, &ldquo;What do
      you pay?&rdquo; instead of asking him, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; When this doctrine
      has passed down from the bourgeoisie to the populace, where will this
      country be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Grandet, have you done?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, I am praying for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good! Good-night; to-morrow morning we will have a talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learned his
      lessons, knows he will see his master&rsquo;s angry face on the morrow. At the
      moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet above her head
      that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown and with naked
      feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my good mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to-morrow I will tell him it was I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he would send you to Noyers. Leave me to manage it; he cannot eat
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> is weeping still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor is
      damp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Thus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the whole
      life of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be so
      calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment. It often happens
      that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking, improbable,
      though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit to turn the stream
      of psychological light upon our impulsive determinations, and fail to
      explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously conceived in our minds, which
      impelled them? Perhaps Eugenie&rsquo;s deep passion should be analyzed in its
      most delicate fibres; for it became, scoffers might say, a malady which
      influenced her whole existence. Many people prefer to deny results rather
      than estimate the force of ties and links and bonds, which secretly join
      one fact to another in the moral order. Here, therefore, Eugenie&rsquo;s past
      life will offer to observers of human nature an explanation of her naive
      want of reflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed her
      soul. The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was her womanly
      pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developed in her
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to listen to
      her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed in her heart.
      Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes she dreamed that he
      fainted from hunger. Towards morning she was certain that she heard a
      startling cry. She dressed at once and ran, in the dawning light, with a
      swift foot to her cousin&rsquo;s chamber, the door of which he had left open.
      The candle had burned down to the socket. Charles, overcome by nature, was
      sleeping, dressed and sitting in an armchair beside the bed, on which his
      head rested; he dreamed as men dream on an empty stomach. Eugenie might
      weep at her ease; she might admire the young and handsome face blotted
      with grief, the eyes swollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they
      were, to well forth tears. Charles felt sympathetically the young girl&rsquo;s
      presence; he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my cousin,&rdquo; he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor the
      place in which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and <i>we</i> thought you might
      need something. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alone can
      dare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes her calculations as
      well as vice. Eugenie, who had not trembled beside her cousin, could
      scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her chamber. Her ignorant
      life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned, she rebuked herself with
      many reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was what she most wished him to think. An honest love has its own
      prescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for this poor
      solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man! Are there
      not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to certain souls bear
      the full meaning of the holiest espousals? An hour later she went to her
      mother and dressed her as usual. Then they both came down and sat in their
      places before the window waiting for Grandet, with that cruel anxiety
      which, according to the individual character, freezes the heart or warms
      it, shrivels or dilates it, when a scene is feared, a punishment expected,&mdash;a
      feeling so natural that even domestic animals possess it, and whine at the
      slightest pain of punishment, though they make no outcry when they
      inadvertently hurt themselves. The goodman came down; but he spoke to his
      wife with an absent manner, kissed Eugenie, and sat down to table without
      appearing to remember his threats of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of my nephew? The lad gives no trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, he is asleep,&rdquo; answered Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better; he won&rsquo;t want a wax candle,&rdquo; said Grandet in a
      jeering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet with
      amazement, and she looked at her husband attentively. The goodman&mdash;here
      it may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, and Bretagne the
      word &ldquo;goodman,&rdquo; already used to designate Grandet, is bestowed as often
      upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindly temperament, when either
      have reached a certain age; the title means nothing on the score of
      individual gentleness&mdash;the goodman took his hat and gloves, saying as
      he went out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in the
      preliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to his views
      and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailing success at
      sight of which his townsmen stood amazed. All human power is a compound of
      time and patience. Powerful beings will and wait. The life of a miser is
      the constant exercise of human power put to the service of self. It rests
      on two sentiments only,&mdash;self-love and self-interest; but
      self-interest being to a certain extent compact and intelligent self-love,
      the visible sign of real superiority, it follows that self-love and
      self-interest are two parts of the same whole,&mdash;egotism. From this
      arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosity shown in the habits of a miser&rsquo;s
      life whenever they are put before the world. Every nature holds by a
      thread to those beings who challenge all human sentiments by concentrating
      all in one passion. Where is the man without desire? and what social
      desire can be satisfied without money?
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet unquestionably &ldquo;had something on his mind,&rdquo; to use his wife&rsquo;s
      expression. There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent craving to
      play a commercial game with other men and win their money legally. To
      impose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetual proof
      that he had won the right to despise those feeble beings who suffer
      themselves to be preyed upon in this world. Oh! who has ever truly
      understood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?&mdash;touching
      emblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future, suffering and
      weakness glorified! This lamb it is which the miser fattens, puts in his
      fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises. The pasture of misers is
      compounded of money and disdain. During the night Grandet&rsquo;s ideas had
      taken another course, which was the reason of his sudden clemency. He had
      hatched a plot by which to trick the Parisians, to decoy and dupe and
      snare them, to drive them into a trap, and make them go and come and sweat
      and hope and turn pale,&mdash;a plot by which to amuse himself, the old
      provincial cooper, sitting there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up
      and down the rotten staircase of his house in Saumur. His nephew filled
      his mind. He wished to save the honor of his dead brother without the cost
      of a penny to the son or to himself. His own funds he was about to invest
      for three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than to manage his
      property in Saumur. He needed some nutriment for his malicious activity,
      and he found it suddenly in his brother&rsquo;s failure. Feeling nothing to
      squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush the Parisians in behalf
      of Charles, and to play the part of a good brother on the cheapest terms.
      The honor of the family counted for so little in this scheme that his good
      intentions might be likened to the interest a gambler takes in seeing a
      game well played in which he has no stake. The Cruchots were a necessary
      part of his plan; but he would not seek them,&mdash;he resolved to make
      them come to him, and to lead up that very evening to a comedy whose plot
      he had just conceived, which should make him on the morrow an object of
      admiration to the whole town without its costing him a single penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her father&rsquo;s absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herself
      openly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly the
      treasures of her pity,&mdash;woman&rsquo;s sublime superiority, the sole she
      desires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting her
      assume. Three or four times the young girl went to listen to her cousin&rsquo;s
      breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake; then, when he had risen,
      she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, the fruits, the plates,
      the glasses,&mdash;all that was a part of his breakfast became the object
      of some special care. At length she ran lightly up the old staircase to
      listen to the noise her cousin made. Was he dressing? Did he still weep?
      She reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episode in a
      poem to Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as not to
      annoy my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, go and do his room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest noise,
      now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. It grew luminous; it
      had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself,&mdash;young like
      the love it was now serving. Her mother, her kind, indulgent mother, lent
      herself to the caprices of the child&rsquo;s love, and after the room was put in
      order, both went to sit with the unhappy youth and keep him company. Does
      not Christian charity make consolation a duty? The two women drew a goodly
      number of little sophistries from their religion wherewith to justify
      their conduct. Charles was made the object of the tenderest and most
      loving care. His saddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle
      friendship, the exquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under
      perpetual restraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant,
      they were left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linen and
      put in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought; thus she could
      marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and the various knick-knacks
      of silver or chased gold, which she held long in her hand under a pretext
      of examining them. Charles could not see without emotion the generous
      interest his aunt and cousin felt in him; he knew society in Paris well
      enough to feel assured that, placed as he now was, he would find all
      hearts indifferent or cold. Eugenie thus appeared to him in the splendor
      of a special beauty, and from thenceforth he admired the innocence of life
      and manners which the previous evening he had been inclined to ridicule.
      So when Eugenie took from Nanon the bowl of coffee and cream, and began to
      pour it out for her cousin with the simplicity of real feeling, giving him
      a kindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian filled with tears; he took her
      hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What troubles you?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! these are tears of gratitude,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Nanon, carry them away!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but her
      looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy which
      innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same sentiment as
      their souls flowed together in one thought,&mdash;the future was theirs.
      This soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles in the midst of his
      heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected. The sound of the knocker
      recalled the women to their usual station. Happily they were able to run
      downstairs with sufficient rapidity to be seated at their work when
      Grandet entered; had he met them under the archway it would have been
      enough to rouse his suspicions. After breakfast, which the goodman took
      standing, the keeper from Froidfond, to whom the promised indemnity had
      never yet been paid, made his appearance, bearing a hare and some
      partridges shot in the park, with eels and two pike sent as tribute by the
      millers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent. Is all that
      fit to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Nanon, bestir yourself,&rdquo; said Grandet; &ldquo;take these things, they&rsquo;ll
      do for dinner. I have invited the two Cruchots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybody in
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and how am I to get the lard and the spices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;give Nanon six francs, and remind me to get some of
      the good wine out of the cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Monsieur Grandet,&rdquo; said the keeper, who had come prepared
      with an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of the
      indemnity, &ldquo;Monsieur Grandet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta!&rdquo; said Grandet; &ldquo;I know what you want to say. You are a
      good fellow; we will see about it to-morrow, I&rsquo;m too busy to-day. Wife,
      give him five francs,&rdquo; he added to Madame Grandet as he decamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of eleven
      francs. She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnight after he
      had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Cornoiller,&rdquo; she said, slipping ten francs into the man&rsquo;s hand,
      &ldquo;some day we will reward your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornoiller could say nothing, so he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken her basket,
      &ldquo;I want only three francs. You keep the rest; it&rsquo;ll go fast enough
      somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it,&rdquo; said
      Madame Grandet. &ldquo;This is only the third time since our marriage that your
      father has given a dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      About four o&rsquo;clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finished setting
      the table for six persons, and after the master of the house had brought
      up a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincials cherish with true
      affection, Charles came down into the hall. The young fellow was pale; his
      gestures, the expression of his face, his glance, and the tones of his
      voice, all had a sadness which was full of grace. He was not pretending
      grief, he truly suffered; and the veil of pain cast over his features gave
      him an interesting air dear to the heart of women. Eugenie loved him the
      more for it. Perhaps she felt that sorrow drew him nearer to her. Charles
      was no longer the rich and distinguished young man placed in a sphere far
      above her, but a relation plunged into frightful misery. Misery begets
      equality. Women have this in common with the angels,&mdash;suffering
      humanity belongs to them. Charles and Eugenie understood each other and
      spoke only with their eyes; for the poor fallen dandy, orphaned and
      impoverished, sat apart in a corner of the room, and was proudly calm and
      silent. Yet, from time to time, the gentle and caressing glance of the
      young girl shone upon him and constrained him away from his sad thoughts,
      drawing him with her into the fields of hope and of futurity, where she
      loved to hold him at her side.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinner given
      by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before at the sale
      of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-treason against
      the whole wine-growing community. If the politic old miser had given his
      dinner from the same idea that cost the dog of Alcibiades his tail, he
      might perhaps have been called a great man; but the fact is, considering
      himself superior to a community which he could trick on all occasions, he
      paid very little heed to what Saumur might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violent
      death of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to their client&rsquo;s
      house that very evening to commiserate his misfortune and show him some
      marks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining the motives which had led
      him to invite the Cruchots to dinner. At precisely five o&rsquo;clock Monsieur
      C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notary arrived in their Sunday clothes.
      The party sat down to table and began to dine with good appetites. Grandet
      was grave, Charles silent, Eugenie dumb, and Madame Grandet did not say
      more than usual; so that the dinner was, very properly, a repast of
      condolence. When they rose from table Charles said to his aunt and uncle,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you permit me to retire? I am obliged to undertake a long and
      painful correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing and was
      probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulating glance
      at his wife,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; it is
      half-past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts.
      Good-night, my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed. A scene now took place in
      which Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other moment of his
      life, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercourse with men,
      and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimes bit too sharply
      the nickname of &ldquo;the old dog.&rdquo; If the mayor of Saumur had carried his
      ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances, drawing him towards the
      higher social spheres, had sent him into congresses where the affairs of
      nations were discussed, and had he there employed the genius with which
      his personal interests had endowed him, he would undoubtedly have proved
      nobly useful to his native land. Yet it is perhaps equally certain that
      outside of Saumur the goodman would have cut a very sorry figure. Possibly
      there are minds like certain animals which cease to breed when
      transplanted from the climates in which they are born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-m-mon-sieur le p-p-president, you said t-t-that b-b-bankruptcy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suited him,
      and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimes complained in
      rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a natural defect, became at
      this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots that while they listened they
      unconsciously made faces and moved their lips, as if pronouncing the words
      over which he was hesitating and stuttering at will. Here it may be well
      to give the history of this impediment of the speech and hearing of
      Monsieur Grandet. No one in Anjou heard better, or could pronounce more
      crisply the French language (with an Angevin accent) than the wily old
      cooper. Some years earlier, in spite of his shrewdness, he had been taken
      in by an Israelite, who in the course of the discussion held his hand
      behind his ear to catch sounds, and mangled his meaning so thoroughly in
      trying to utter his words that Grandet fell a victim to his humanity and
      was compelled to prompt the wily Jew with the words and ideas he seemed to
      seek, to complete himself the arguments of the said Jew, to say what that
      cursed Jew ought to have said for himself; in short, to be the Jew instead
      of being Grandet. When the cooper came out of this curious encounter he
      had concluded the only bargain of which in the course of a long commercial
      life he ever had occasion to complain. But if he lost at the time
      pecuniarily, he gained morally a valuable lesson; later, he gathered its
      fruits. Indeed, the goodman ended by blessing that Jew for having taught
      him the art of irritating his commercial antagonist and leading him to
      forget his own thoughts in his impatience to suggest those over which his
      tormentor was stuttering. No affair had ever needed the assistance of
      deafness, impediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible
      circumlocutions with which Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the
      affair now in hand. In the first place, he did not mean to shoulder the
      responsibility of his own scheme; in the next, he was determined to remain
      master of the conversation and to leave his real intentions in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-m-monsieur de B-B-Bonfons,&rdquo;&mdash;for the second time in three years
      Grandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the president felt
      he might consider himself the artful old fellow&rsquo;s son-in-law,&mdash;&ldquo;you-ou
      said th-th-that b-b-bankruptcy c-c-could, in some c-c-cases, b-b-be
      p-p-prevented b-b-by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the courts of commerce themselves. It is done constantly,&rdquo; said
      Monsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet&rsquo;s meaning, or thinking he
      guessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boy who
      is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatest
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-my b-b-brother, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;is threatened with insolvency&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They c-c-call it in-ins-s-solvency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which he is
      amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by a decree, to
      appoint a receiver. Liquidation, you understand, is not the same as
      failure. When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when he merely
      liquidates, he remains an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-t-that&rsquo;s very d-d-different, if it d-d-doesn&rsquo;t c-c-cost m-m-more,&rdquo; said
      Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to the courts at
      all. For,&rdquo; said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know
      how failures are declared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-n-no, I n-n-never t-t-thought,&rdquo; answered Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; resumed the magistrate, &ldquo;by filing the schedule in
      the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself, or his
      representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified. In the
      second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion from the
      creditors. Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and if no
      creditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvency
      against the merchant, what happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-w-what h-h-happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, or the
      merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is only hiding,
      liquidate his business. Perhaps you would like to liquidate your brother&rsquo;s
      affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Grandet,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;that would be the right thing to do.
      There is honor down here in the provinces. If you save your name&mdash;for
      it is your name&mdash;you will be a man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble man!&rdquo; cried the president, interrupting his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered the old man, &ldquo;my b-b-brother&rsquo;s name was G-G-Grandet,
      like m-m-mine. Th-that&rsquo;s c-c-certain; I d-d-don&rsquo;t d-d-deny it. And
      th-th-this l-l-liquidation might be, in m-m-many ways, v-v-very
      advan-t-t-tageous t-t-to the interests of m-m-my n-n-nephew, whom I
      l-l-love. But I must consider. I don&rsquo;t k-k-know the t-t-tricks of
      P-P-Paris. I b-b-belong to Sau-m-mur, d-d-don&rsquo;t you see? M-m-my vines, my
      d-d-drains&mdash;in short, I&rsquo;ve my own b-b-business. I never g-g-give
      n-n-notes. What are n-n-notes? I t-t-take a good m-m-many, but I have
      never s-s-signed one. I d-d-don&rsquo;t understand such things. I have h-h-heard
      say that n-n-notes c-c-can be b-b-bought up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Notes can be bought in the market, less
      so much per cent. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet made an ear-trumpet of his hand, and the president repeated his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s s-s-something to be g-g-got out of
      it? I k-know n-nothing at my age about such th-th-things. I l-l-live here
      and l-l-look after the v-v-vines. The vines g-g-grow, and it&rsquo;s the
      w-w-wine that p-p-pays. L-l-look after the v-v-vintage, t-t-that&rsquo;s my
      r-r-rule. My c-c-chief interests are at Froidfond. I c-c-can&rsquo;t l-l-leave
      my h-h-house to m-m-muddle myself with a d-d-devilish b-b-business I
      kn-know n-n-nothing about. You say I ought to l-l-liquidate my
      b-b-brother&rsquo;s af-f-fairs, to p-p-prevent the f-f-failure. I c-c-can&rsquo;t be
      in two p-p-places at once, unless I were a little b-b-bird, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; cried the notary. &ldquo;Well, my old friend, you have friends,
      old friends, capable of devoting themselves to your interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; thought Grandet, &ldquo;make haste and come to the point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume&rsquo;s chief
      creditor and said to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One m-m-moment,&rdquo; interrupted the goodman, &ldquo;said wh-wh-what? Something
      l-l-like this. Monsieur Gr-Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet of
      Saumur that. He l-loves his b-b-brother, he loves his n-nephew. Grandet is
      a g-g-good uncle; he m-m-means well. He has sold his v-v-vintage.
      D-d-don&rsquo;t declare a f-f-failure; c-c-call a meeting; l-l-liquidate; and
      then Gr-Gr-Grandet will see what he c-c-can do. B-b-better liquidate than
      l-let the l-l-law st-st-stick its n-n-nose in. Hein? isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-because, don&rsquo;t you see, Monsieur de B-Bonfons, a man must l-l-look
      b-b-before he l-leaps. If you c-c-can&rsquo;t, you c-c-can&rsquo;t. M-m-must know all
      about the m-m-matter, all the resources and the debts, if you d-d-don&rsquo;t
      want to be r-r-ruined. Hein? isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of opinion that in a few months the
      debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in full by an
      agreement. Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show him a bit of
      lard. If there has been no declaration of failure, and you hold a lien on
      the debts, you come out of the business as white as the driven snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sn-n-now,&rdquo; said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, &ldquo;wh-wh-what about
      s-now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the president, &ldquo;do pray attend to what I am saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at-t-tending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A note is merchandise,&mdash;an article of barter which rises and falls
      in prices. That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s theory about usury.
      That writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers to
      reprobation was mere folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; ejaculated the goodman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article of merchandise,
      and that whatever represents money is equally merchandise,&rdquo; resumed the
      president; &ldquo;allowing also that it is notorious that the commercial note,
      bearing this or that signature, is liable to the fluctuation of all
      commercial values, rises or falls in the market, is dear at one moment,
      and is worth nothing at another, the courts decide&mdash;ah! how stupid I
      am, I beg your pardon&mdash;I am inclined to think you could buy up your
      brother&rsquo;s debts for twenty-five per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-d-did you c-c-call him Je-Je-Jeremy B-Ben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bentham, an Englishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,&rdquo;
       said the notary, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those Englishmen s-sometimes t-t-talk sense,&rdquo; said Grandet. &ldquo;So,
      ac-c-cording to Ben-Bentham, if my b-b-brother&rsquo;s n-notes are worth
      n-n-nothing; if Je-Je&mdash;I&rsquo;m c-c-correct, am I not? That seems
      c-c-clear to my m-m-mind&mdash;the c-c-creditors would be&mdash;No, would
      not be; I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me explain it all,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Legally, if you acquire a
      title to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or his heirs
      will owe nothing to any one. Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very g-good,&rdquo; repeated Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In equity, if your brother&rsquo;s notes are negotiated&mdash;negotiated, do
      you clearly understand the term?&mdash;negotiated in the market at a
      reduction of so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends
      happening to be present should buy them in, the creditors having sold them
      of their own free-will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet
      is honorably released.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s t-true; b-b-business is b-business,&rdquo; said the cooper. &ldquo;B-b-but,
      st-still, you know, it is d-d-difficult. I h-have n-no m-m-money and n-no
      t-t-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you need not undertake it. I am quite ready to go to Paris (you
      may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle). I will see the creditors
      and talk with them and get an extension of time, and everything can be
      arranged if you will add something to the assets so as to buy up all title
      to the debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-we&rsquo;ll see about th-that. I c-c-can&rsquo;t and I w-w-won&rsquo;t bind myself
      without&mdash;He who c-c-can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t; don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all p-p-put ab-b-bout by what you&rsquo;ve t-t-told me. This is the f-first
      t-t-time in my life I have b-been obliged to th-th-think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are not a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a p-p-poor wine-g-grower, and know n-nothing about wh-what you
      have just t-told me; I m-m-must th-think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the president, preparing to resume his argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, uncle?&rdquo; answered the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions. The matter in question
      is of the first importance. Our good friend ought to define his meaning
      clearly, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family,
      succeeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot from
      concluding his sentence. The notary was glad of the interruption, for
      Grandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gave signs
      of a brewing storm. In the first place, the notary did not think it
      becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris and manipulate
      creditors and lend himself to an underhand job which clashed with the laws
      of strict integrity; moreover, never having known old Grandet to express
      the slightest desire to pay anything, no matter what, he instinctively
      feared to see his nephew taking part in the affair. He therefore profited
      by the entrance of the des Grassins to take the nephew by the arm and lead
      him into the embrasure of the window,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said enough, nephew; you&rsquo;ve shown enough devotion. Your desire
      to win the girl blinds you. The devil! you mustn&rsquo;t go at it tooth and
      nail. Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces. Do you think
      it right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate in such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the old cooper as
      they shook hands,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have just
      befallen your family,&mdash;the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandet
      and the death of your brother. We have come to express our grief at these
      sad events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one sad event,&rdquo; said the notary, interrupting the banker,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would never have killed himself
      had he thought in time of applying to his brother for help. Our old
      friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails, intends to liquidate the
      debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris. To save him the worry of legal
      proceedings, my nephew, the president, has just offered to go to Paris and
      negotiate with the creditors for a satisfactory settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, corroborated by Grandet&rsquo;s attitude as he stood silently
      nursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had been
      leisurely discussing the old man&rsquo;s avarice as they came along, very nearly
      accusing him of fratricide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I was sure of it,&rdquo; cried the banker, looking at his wife. &ldquo;What did I
      tell you just now, Madame des Grassins? Grandet is honorable to the
      backbone, and would never allow his name to remain under the slightest
      cloud! Money without honor is a disease. There is honor in the provinces!
      Right, very right, Grandet. I&rsquo;m an old soldier, and I can&rsquo;t disguise my
      thoughts; I speak roughly. Thunder! it is sublime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-then s-s-sublime th-things c-c-cost d-dear,&rdquo; answered the goodman, as
      the banker warmly wrung his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this, my dear Grandet,&mdash;if the president will excuse me,&mdash;is
      a purely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. Your
      agent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets,&mdash;with
      disbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth. I am going to
      Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about t-t-trying to m-m-manage it b-b-between us, under the
      p-p-peculiar c-c-circumstances, b-b-but without b-b-binding m-m-myself to
      anything th-that I c-c-could not do,&rdquo; said Grandet, stuttering; &ldquo;because,
      you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to pay the expenses of
      his journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The goodman did not stammer over the last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; cried Madame des Grassins, &ldquo;why it is a pleasure to go to Paris. I
      would willingly pay to go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting the
      enemy out of the commission, <i>coute que coute</i>; then she glanced
      ironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap-fallen. Grandet seized the
      banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;besides, I&rsquo;ve other fish to fry,&rdquo; he added, wriggling his wen. &ldquo;I
      want to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are at eighty.
      They fall, I&rsquo;m told, at the end of each month. You know all about these
      things, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousand francs a
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much to begin with. Hush! I don&rsquo;t want any one to know I am
      going to play that game. You can make the investment by the end of the
      month. Say nothing to the Cruchots; that&rsquo;ll annoy them. If you are really
      going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done for my poor
      nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all settled. I&rsquo;ll start to-morrow by the mail-post,&rdquo; said des
      Grassins aloud, &ldquo;and I will come and take your last directions at&mdash;what
      hour will suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock, just before dinner,&rdquo; said Grandet, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two parties stayed on for a short time. Des Grassins said, after a
      pause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good thing to have a relation like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; without making a show,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;I am a g-good relation.
      I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless it c-c-costs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave you, Grandet,&rdquo; said the banker, interrupting him
      fortunately before he got to the end of his sentence. &ldquo;If I hurry my
      departure, I must attend to some matters at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, very good! I myself&mdash;in c-consequence of what I t-told
      you&mdash;I must retire to my own room and &lsquo;d-d-deliberate,&rsquo; as President
      Cruchot says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague take him! I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons,&rdquo; thought the
      magistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge bored by
      an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heads of the two factions walked off together. Neither gave any
      further thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in the morning
      against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathom what the
      other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily old man in this
      new affair, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said des Grassins to the
      notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go there later,&rdquo; answered the president. &ldquo;I have promised to say
      good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go there first,
      if my uncle is willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell for the present!&rdquo; said Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to his father,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not they fuming, hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, my son!&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;they might hear you.
      Besides, what you say is not in good taste,&mdash;law-school language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, uncle,&rdquo; cried the president when he saw the des Grassins
      disappearing, &ldquo;I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended as nothing
      but Cruchot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the des
      Grassins. What a fool you are, with all your cleverness! Let them sail off
      on Grandet&rsquo;s &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it,&rsquo; and keep yourself quiet, young man.
      Eugenie will none the less be your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the news of Grandet&rsquo;s magnanimous resolve was
      disseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole town began
      to talk of his fraternal devotion. Every one forgave Grandet for the sale
      made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community; they admired
      his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity of which they had never
      thought him capable. It is part of the French nature to grow enthusiastic,
      or angry, or fervent about some meteor of the moment. Can it be that
      collective beings, nationalities, peoples, are devoid of memory?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the dog loose, and don&rsquo;t go to bed; we have work to do
      together. At eleven o&rsquo;clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the
      chariot from Froidfond. Listen for him and prevent his knocking; tell him
      to come in softly. Police regulations don&rsquo;t allow nocturnal racket.
      Besides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I am starting on a
      journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard him
      moving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with much
      precaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife and daughter,
      and above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whom he had begun
      to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under his door. About the
      middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin, fancied she heard a cry
      like that of a dying person. It must be Charles, she thought; he was so
      pale, so full of despair when she had seen him last,&mdash;could he have
      killed himself? She wrapped herself quickly in a loose garment,&mdash;a
      sort of pelisse with a hood,&mdash;and was about to leave the room when a
      bright light coming through the chinks of her door made her think of fire.
      But she recovered herself as she heard Nanon&rsquo;s heavy steps and gruff voice
      mingling with the snorting of several horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can my father be carrying off my cousin?&rdquo; she said to herself, opening
      her door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yet enough to let
      her see into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague and
      unnoticing as it was, terrified her. The goodman and Nanon were yoked
      together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on their shoulders; a
      stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a small barrel or keg
      like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse as an amusement for
      his leisure hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!&rdquo; said the voice of Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity that it is only copper sous!&rdquo; answered Grandet. &ldquo;Take care
      you don&rsquo;t knock over the candlestick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails of the
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornoiller,&rdquo; said Grandet to his keeper <i>in partibus</i>, &ldquo;have you
      brought your pistols?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur. Mercy! what&rsquo;s there to fear for your copper sous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing,&rdquo; said Pere Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, we shall go fast,&rdquo; added the man; &ldquo;your farmers have picked out
      their best horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. You did not tell them where I was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Is the carriage strong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong? hear to that, now! Why, it can carry three thousand weight. How
      much does that old keg weigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Nanon. &ldquo;I ought to know! There&rsquo;s pretty nigh
      eighteen hundred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hold your tongue, Nanon! You are to tell my wife I have gone
      into the country. I shall be back to dinner. Drive fast, Cornoiller; I
      must get to Angers before nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage drove off. Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the dog,
      and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the neighborhood
      suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object of his journey.
      The precautions of the old miser and his reticence were never relaxed. No
      one had ever seen a penny in that house, filled as it was with gold.
      Hearing in the morning, through the gossip of the port, that exchange on
      gold had doubled in price in consequence of certain military preparations
      undertaken at Nantes, and that speculators had arrived at Angers to buy
      coin, the old wine-grower, by the simple process of borrowing horses from
      his farmers, seized the chance of selling his gold and of bringing back in
      the form of treasury notes the sum he intended to put into the Funds,
      having swelled it considerably by the exchange.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has gone,&rdquo; thought Eugenie, who heard all that took place from
      the head of the stairs. Silence was restored in the house, and the distant
      rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longer echoed through the
      sleeping town. At this moment Eugenie heard in her heart, before the sound
      caught her ears, a cry which pierced the partitions and came from her
      cousin&rsquo;s chamber. A line of light, thin as the blade of a sabre, shone
      through a chink in the door and fell horizontally on the balusters of the
      rotten staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suffers!&rdquo; she said, springing up the stairs. A second moan brought her
      to the landing near his room. The door was ajar, she pushed it open.
      Charles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the old armchair, and
      his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touched the floor. The
      oppressed breathing caused by the strained posture suddenly frightened
      Eugenie, who entered the room hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be very tired,&rdquo; she said to herself, glancing at a dozen letters
      lying sealed upon the table. She read their addresses: &ldquo;To Messrs. Farry,
      Breilmann, &amp; Co., carriage-makers&rdquo;; &ldquo;To Monsieur Buisson, tailor,&rdquo;
       etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,&rdquo; she
      thought. Her eyes fell upon two open letters. The words, &ldquo;My dear
      Annette,&rdquo; at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment. Her heart
      beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His dear Annette! He loves! he is loved! No hope! What does he say to
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts rushed through her head and heart. She saw the words
      everywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resign him already? No, no! I will not read the letter. I ought to go
      away&mdash;What if I do read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed it against
      the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which, though
      asleep, knows its mother&rsquo;s touch and receives, without awaking, her kisses
      and watchful care. Like a mother Eugenie raised the drooping hand, and
      like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Annette!&rdquo; a
      demon shrieked the words in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter,&rdquo; she said. She turned
      away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her. For the first
      time in her life good and evil struggled together in her heart. Up to that
      moment she had never had to blush for any action. Passion and curiosity
      triumphed. As she read each sentence her heart swelled more and more, and
      the keen glow which filled her being as she did so, only made the joys of
      first love still more precious.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Annette,&mdash;Nothing could ever have separated us but the
  great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human
  foresight could have prevented. My father has killed himself; his
  fortune and mine are irretrievably lost. I am orphaned at an age
  when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and
  yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am
  plunged. I have just spent half the night in facing my position.
  If I wish to leave France an honest man,&mdash;and there is no doubt of
  that,&mdash;I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my
  fate in the Indies or in America. Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek
  my fortune in those deadly climates. Under those skies, they tell
  me, I am sure to make it. As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do
  so. Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts,
  the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a
  bankrupt! Good God! think of owing two millions! I should be
  killed in a duel the first week; therefore I shall not return
  there. Your love&mdash;the most tender and devoted love which ever
  ennobled the heart of man&mdash;cannot draw me back. Alas! my beloved,
  I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a
  last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn
  enterprise.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. I have gold; I will give it
      to him,&rdquo; thought Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wiped her eyes, and went on reading.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. If I have the
  hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have
  not a sou for an outfit. But no, I have not the hundred louis, not
  even one louis. I don&rsquo;t know that anything will be left after I
  have paid my debts in Paris. If I have nothing, I shall go quietly
  to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new
  world like other men who have started young without a sou and
  brought back the wealth of the Indies. During this long day I have
  faced my future coolly. It seems more horrible for me than for
  another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me,
  so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on
  my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna! The flowers of
  life are all I have ever known. Such happiness could not last.
  Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless
  young man is supposed to feel,&mdash;above all a young man used to the
  caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in
  family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes
  were a law to his father&mdash;oh, my father! Annette, he is dead!

  Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well. I have
  grown old in twenty-four hours. Dear Anna, if in order to keep me
  with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress,
  your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the
  expenses of my extravagant ways of living. Besides, I would never
  accept such sacrifices. No, we must part now and forever&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives her up! Blessed Virgin! What happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie quivered with joy. Charles made a movement, and a chill of terror
      ran through her. Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumed her
      reading.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When shall I return? I do not know. The climate of the West Indies
  ages a European, so they say; especially a European who works
  hard. Let us think what may happen ten years hence. In ten years
  your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your
  spy. To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more
  cruel still. We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and
  ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them. Keep in the
  depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years
  of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your
  poor friend. I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you
  see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new
  life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I
  can. Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the
  necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I
  have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle&rsquo;s house, a cousin whose
  face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides,
  seems to me&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her,&rdquo; thought
      Eugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in the middle
      of the last sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already she defended him. How was it possible that an innocent girl should
      perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter? To young girls
      religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, all is love
      from the moment they set their feet within the enchanted regions of that
      passion. They walk there bathed in a celestial light shed from their own
      souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover; they color all with the
      flame of their own emotion and attribute to him their highest thoughts. A
      woman&rsquo;s errors come almost always from her belief in good or her
      confidence in truth. In Eugenie&rsquo;s simple heart the words, &ldquo;My dear
      Annette, my loved one,&rdquo; echoed like the sweetest language of love; they
      caressed her soul as, in childhood, the divine notes of the <i>Venite
      adoremus</i>, repeated by the organ, caressed her ear. Moreover, the tears
      which still lingered on the young man&rsquo;s lashes gave signs of that nobility
      of heart by which young girls are rightly won. How could she know that
      Charles, though he loved his father and mourned him truly, was moved far
      more by paternal goodness than by the goodness of his own heart? Monsieur
      and Madame Guillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy of their son, and
      lavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune, had kept him from
      making the horrible calculations of which so many sons in Paris become
      more or less guilty when, face to face with the enjoyments of the world,
      they form desires and conceive schemes which they see with bitterness must
      be put off or laid aside during the lifetime of their parents. The
      liberality of the father in this instance had shed into the heart of the
      son a real love, in which there was no afterthought of self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customs of
      society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already an old man
      under the mask of youth. He had gone through the frightful education of
      social life, of that world where in one evening more crimes are committed
      in thought and speech than justice ever punishes at the assizes; where
      jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblest ideas; where no one is
      counted strong unless his mind sees clear: and to see clear in that world
      is to believe in nothing, neither in feelings, nor in men, nor even in
      events,&mdash;for events are falsified. There, to &ldquo;see clear&rdquo; we must
      weigh a friend&rsquo;s purse daily, learn how to keep ourselves adroitly on the
      top of the wave, cautiously admire nothing, neither works of art nor
      glorious actions, and remember that self-interest is the mainspring of all
      things here below. After committing many follies, the great lady&mdash;the
      beautiful Annette&mdash;compelled Charles to think seriously; with her
      perfumed hand among his curls, she talked to him of his future position;
      as she rearranged his locks, she taught him lessons of worldly prudence;
      she made him effeminate and materialized him,&mdash;a double corruption,
      but a delicate and elegant corruption, in the best taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very foolish, Charles,&rdquo; she would say to him. &ldquo;I shall have a
      great deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world. You behaved
      extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx. I know very well he is not an
      honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then you may
      despise him as much as you like. Do you know what Madame Campan used to
      tell us?&mdash;&lsquo;My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore him; when
      he falls, help to drag him in the gutter. Powerful, he is a sort of god;
      fallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because he is living, and
      Marat is dead. Life is a series of combinations, and you must study them
      and understand them if you want to keep yourselves always in good
      position.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him too
      happy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessed of
      noble sentiments. The grain of gold dropped by his mother into his heart
      was beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spread it
      superficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life. Charles was
      only twenty-one years old. At that age the freshness of youth seems
      inseparable from candor and sincerity of soul. The voice, the glance, the
      face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; and thus it happens that
      the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer, the least complying of
      usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitude of heart or the corruption
      of worldly calculation while the eyes are still bathed in purity and no
      wrinkles seam the brow. Charles, so far, had had no occasion to apply the
      maxims of Parisian morality; up to this time he was still endowed with the
      beauty of inexperience. And yet, unknown to himself, he had been
      inoculated with selfishness. The germs of Parisian political economy,
      latent in his heart, would assuredly burst forth, sooner or later,
      whenever the careless spectator became an actor in the drama of real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outward
      appearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent and
      observing as provincial girls are often found to be, she was not likely to
      distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actions were still in
      unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart. A mere chance&mdash;a
      fatal chance&mdash;threw in her way the last effusions of real feeling
      which stirred the young man&rsquo;s soul; she heard as it were the last
      breathings of his conscience. She laid down the letter&mdash;to her so
      full of love&mdash;and began smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; the
      fresh illusions of life were still, for her at least, upon his face; she
      vowed to herself to love him always. Then she cast her eyes on the other
      letter, without attaching much importance to this second indiscretion; and
      though she read it, it was only to obtain new proofs of the noble
      qualities which, like all women, she attributed to the man her heart had
      chosen.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Alphonse,&mdash;When you receive this letter I shall be without
  friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship
  of the world, I have never doubted yours. I beg you therefore to
  settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you
  can out of my possessions. By this time you know my situation. I
  have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies. I
  have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money,
  and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I
  can make it from memory. My books, my furniture, my pictures, my
  horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts. I do not wish to
  keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as
  the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise. My dear Alphonse, I
  will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make
  these sales. Send me all my weapons. Keep Briton for yourself;
  nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather
  give him to you&mdash;like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to
  his executor. Farry, Breilmann, &amp; Co. built me a very comfortable
  travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade
  them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it. If they refuse,
  do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might
  seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances. I owe the
  British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don&rsquo;t fail to
  pay him&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear cousin!&rdquo; whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and running
      softly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles. A thrill of
      pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oak cabinet, a
      fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, on which could still
      be seen, partly effaced, the famous royal salamander. She took from the
      drawer a large purse of red velvet with gold tassels, edged with a
      tarnished fringe of gold wire,&mdash;a relic inherited from her
      grandmother. She weighed it proudly in her hand, and began with delight to
      count over the forgotten items of her little hoard. First she took out
      twenty <i>portugaises</i>, still new, struck in the reign of John V.,
      1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her, five <i>lisbonnines</i>,
      or a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-four centimes each; their
      conventional value, however, was a hundred and eighty francs apiece, on
      account of the rarity and beauty of the coins, which shone like little
      suns. Item, five <i>genovines</i>, or five hundred-franc pieces of Genoa;
      another very rare coin worth eighty-seven francs on exchange, but a
      hundred francs to collectors. These had formerly belonged to old Monsieur
      de la Bertelliere. Item, three gold <i>quadruples</i>, Spanish, of Philip
      V., struck in 1729, given to her one by one by Madame Gentillet, who never
      failed to say, using the same words, when she made the gift, &ldquo;This dear
      little canary, this little yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight francs! Keep
      it, my pretty one, it will be the flower of your treasure.&rdquo; Item (that
      which her father valued most of all, the gold of these coins being
      twenty-three carats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats, made in the
      year 1756, and worth thirteen francs apiece. Item, a great curiosity, a
      species of medal precious to the soul of misers,&mdash;three rupees with
      the sign of the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the Virgin, all
      in pure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money of the Great
      Mogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven francs, forty
      centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs who love to
      handle gold. Item, the napoleon of forty francs received the day before,
      which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse. This treasure was
      all in virgin coins, true works of art, which Grandet from time to time
      inquired after and asked to see, pointing out to his daughter their
      intrinsic merits,&mdash;such as the beauty of the milled edge, the
      clearness of the flat surface, the richness of the lettering, whose angles
      were not yet rubbed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father&rsquo;s mania for
      them, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of a treasure so
      dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soon made out, after
      a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessed about five thousand
      eight hundred francs in actual value, which might be sold for their
      additional value to collectors for nearly six thousand. She looked at her
      wealth and clapped her hands like a happy child forced to spend its
      overflowing joy in artless movements of the body. Father and daughter had
      each counted up their fortune this night,&mdash;he, to sell his gold;
      Eugenie to fling hers into the ocean of affection. She put the pieces back
      into the old purse, took it in her hand, and ran upstairs without
      hesitation. The secret misery of her cousin made her forget the hour and
      conventional propriety; she was strong in her conscience, in her devotion,
      in her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in one
      hand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her, and
      remained speechless with surprise. Eugenie came forward, put the candle on
      the table, and said in a quivering voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you; but God will
      pardon me&mdash;if you&mdash;will help me to wipe it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Charles, rubbing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read those letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;how came I here? Truly, I do not
      know. I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; they have
      made me know your heart, your soul, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo; asked Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plans, your need of a sum&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear cousin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush! my cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others. See,&rdquo; she
      said, opening her purse, &ldquo;here are the savings of a poor girl who wants
      nothing. Charles, accept them! This morning I was ignorant of the value of
      money; you have taught it to me. It is but a means, after all. A cousin is
      almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse of your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal; but
      her cousin remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you will not refuse?&rdquo; cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heart
      could be heard in the deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cousin&rsquo;s hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of his position
      came clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never rise till you have taken that gold!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My cousin, I
      implore you, answer me! let me know if you respect me, if you are
      generous, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he heard this cry of noble distress the young man&rsquo;s tears fell upon his
      cousin&rsquo;s hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her from kneeling.
      As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purse and poured its
      contents upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, yes, you consent?&rdquo; she said, weeping with joy. &ldquo;Fear nothing, my
      cousin, you will be rich. This gold will bring you happiness; some day you
      shall bring it back to me,&mdash;are we not partners? I will obey all
      conditions. But you should not attach such value to the gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles was at last able to express his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Eugenie; my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept. And yet,&mdash;gift
      for gift, confidence for confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dear cousin; I have here&mdash;&rdquo; He interrupted himself to point
      out a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was on the
      drawers. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is something as precious to me as life
      itself. This box was a present from my mother. All day I have been
      thinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herself sell the
      gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case; but were I to
      do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege.&rdquo; Eugenie pressed his hand as
      she heard these last words. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added, after a slight pause, during
      which a liquid glance of tenderness passed between them, &ldquo;no, I will
      neither sell it nor risk its safety on my journey. Dear Eugenie, you shall
      be its guardian. Never did friend commit anything more sacred to another.
      Let me show it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, and
      showed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanship
      gave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you admire there is nothing,&rdquo; he said, pushing a secret spring which
      opened a hidden drawer. &ldquo;Here is something which to me is worth the whole
      world.&rdquo; He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of Madame Mirbel, richly
      set with pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful! Is it the lady to whom you wrote that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, smiling; &ldquo;this is my mother, and here is my father, your
      aunt and uncle. Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasure safely.
      If I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and these pearls will
      repay you. To you alone could I leave these portraits; you are worthy to
      keep them. But destroy them at last, so that they may pass into no other
      hands.&rdquo; Eugenie was silent. &ldquo;Ah, yes, say yes! You consent?&rdquo; he added with
      winning grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressed to
      herself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look of loving
      womanhood,&mdash;a glance in which there is nearly as much of coquetry as
      of inmost depth. He took her hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angel of purity! between us two money is nothing, never can be anything.
      Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like your mother,&mdash;was her voice as soft as yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! much softer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for you,&rdquo; she said, dropping her eyelids. &ldquo;Come, Charles, go to bed;
      I wish it; you must be tired. Good-night.&rdquo; She gently disengaged her hand
      from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room, lighting the way.
      When they were both upon the threshold,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why am I ruined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter?&mdash;my father is rich; I think so,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Charles, making a step into her room and leaning his
      back against the wall, &ldquo;if that were so, he would never have let my father
      die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he would live otherwise
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he owns Froidfond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Froidfond worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but he has Noyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but a poor farm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has vineyards and fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere nothing,&rdquo; said Charles disdainfully. &ldquo;If your father had only
      twenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live in this
      cold, barren room?&rdquo; he added, making a step in advance. &ldquo;Ah! there you
      will keep my treasures,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the old cabinet, as if to
      hide his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and sleep,&rdquo; she said, hindering his entrance into the disordered room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles stepped back, and they bid each other good-night with a mutual
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youth began
      to wear roses with his mourning. The next day, before breakfast, Madame
      Grandet found her daughter in the garden in company with Charles. The
      young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who, plunged in
      misfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which he has fallen, and
      sees the terrible burden of his whole future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father will not be home till dinner-time,&rdquo; said Eugenie, perceiving
      the anxious look on her mother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and in the
      singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between her and her
      cousin. Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps before they even felt
      the force of the feelings which bound them together. Charles spent the
      morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected. Each of the three
      women had occupations of her own. Grandet had left all his affairs
      unattended to, and a number of persons came on business,&mdash;the
      plumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, the diggers, the dressers,
      the farmers; some to drive a bargain about repairs, others to pay their
      rent or to be paid themselves for services. Madame Grandet and Eugenie
      were obliged to go and come and listen to the interminable talk of all
      these workmen and country folk. Nanon put away in her kitchen the produce
      which they brought as tribute. She always waited for her master&rsquo;s orders
      before she knew what portion was to be used in the house and what was to
      be sold in the market. It was the goodman&rsquo;s custom, like that of a great
      many country gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat his spoiled fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, having made
      fourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringing home in his
      wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until the day he should
      invest them in the Funds. He had left Cornoiller at Angers to look after
      the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, with orders to bring them home
      slowly after they were rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got back from Angers, wife,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon called out to him from the kitchen: &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you eaten anything
      since yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanon brought in the soup. Des Grassins came to take his client&rsquo;s orders
      just as the family sat down to dinner. Grandet had not even observed his
      nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on eating, Grandet,&rdquo; said the banker; &ldquo;we can talk. Do you know what
      gold is worth in Angers? They have come from Nantes after it? I shall send
      some of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send any,&rdquo; said Grandet; &ldquo;they have got enough. We are such old
      friends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say <i>was</i> worth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the devil have they got any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Angers last night,&rdquo; answered Grandet in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker shook with surprise. Then a whispered conversation began
      between the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequently looked
      at Charles. Presently des Grassins gave a start of astonishment; probably
      Grandet was then instructing him to invest the sum which was to give him a
      hundred thousand francs a year in the Funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Grandet,&rdquo; said the banker to Charles, &ldquo;I am starting for Paris;
      if you have any commissions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, monsieur, I thank you,&rdquo; answered Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank him better than that, nephew. Monsieur is going to settle the
      affairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any hope?&rdquo; said Charles eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, &ldquo;are you not my
      nephew? Your honor is ours. Is not your name Grandet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and left the
      room. Eugenie looked at her father with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-by, des Grassins; it is all in your hands. Decoy those people
      as best you can; lead &lsquo;em by the nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two diplomatists shook hands. The old cooper accompanied the banker to
      the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back and plunged into his
      armchair, saying to Nanon,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some black-currant ratafia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked at
      the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing, doing what
      Nanon called his dancing steps,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Dans les gardes francaises
  J&rsquo;avais un bon papa.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence. The
      hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached its climax.
      The evening was soon over. Pere Grandet chose to go to bed early, and when
      he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too; like as when
      Augustus drank, Poland was drunk. On this occasion Nanon, Charles, and
      Eugenie were not less tired than the master. As for Madame Grandet, she
      slept, ate, drank, and walked according to the will of her husband.
      However, during the two hours consecrated to digestion, the cooper, more
      facetious than he had ever been in his life, uttered a number of his own
      particular apothegms,&mdash;a single one of which will give the measure of
      his mind. When he had drunk his ratafia, he looked at his glass and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty! Such is
      life. You can&rsquo;t have and hold. Gold won&rsquo;t circulate and stay in your
      purse. If it were not for that, life would be too fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was jovial and benevolent. When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel,
      &ldquo;You must be tired,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;put away your hemp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah! then I shall get sleepy,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Nanon! Will you have some ratafia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than the
      apothecaries. What they sell is all drugs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They put too much sugar,&rdquo; said the master; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t taste anything
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day the family, meeting at eight o&rsquo;clock for the early
      breakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy. Grief had drawn
      Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles <i>en rapport</i>; even Nanon
      sympathized, without knowing why. The four now made one family. As to the
      old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon getting rid of
      the dandy without having to pay more than his journey to Nantes, made him
      nearly indifferent to his presence in the house. He left the two children,
      as he called Charles and Eugenie, free to conduct themselves as they
      pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet, in whom he had implicit
      confidence as to all that concerned public and religious morality. He
      busied himself in straightening the boundaries of his fields and ditches
      along the high-road, in his poplar-plantations beside the Loire, in the
      winter work of his vineyards, and at Froidfond. All these things occupied
      his whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Eugenie the springtime of love had come. Since the scene at night when
      she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart had followed the
      treasure. Confederates in the same secret, they looked at each other with
      a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of their consciousness,
      giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation to their feelings, and
      putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale of ordinary life. Did not their
      near relationship warrant the gentleness in their tones, the tenderness in
      their glances? Eugenie took delight in lulling her cousin&rsquo;s pain with the
      pretty childish joys of a new-born love. Are there no sweet similitudes
      between the birth of love and the birth of life? Do we not rock the babe
      with gentle songs and softest glances? Do we not tell it marvellous tales
      of the golden future? Hope herself, does she not spread her radiant wings
      above its head? Does it not shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of
      sorrow and its tears of joy? Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the
      pretty pebbles with which to build its shifting palaces, for the flowers
      forgotten as soon as plucked? Is it not eager to grasp the coming time, to
      spring forward into life? Love is our second transformation. Childhood and
      love were one and the same thing to Eugenie and to Charles; it was a first
      passion, with all its child-like play,&mdash;the more caressing to their
      hearts because they now were wrapped in sadness. Struggling at birth
      against the gloom of mourning, their love was only the more in harmony
      with the provincial plainness of that gray and ruined house. As they
      exchanged a few words beside the well in the silent court, or lingered in
      the garden for the sunset hour, sitting on a mossy seat saying to each
      other the infinite nothings of love, or mused in the silent calm which
      reigned between the house and the ramparts like that beneath the arches of
      a church, Charles comprehended the sanctity of love; for his great lady,
      his dear Annette, had taught him only its stormy troubles. At this moment
      he left the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy as it was, and
      turned to the true, pure love. He loved even the house, whose customs no
      longer seemed to him ridiculous. He got up early in the mornings that he
      might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father came to dole out
      the provisions; when the steps of the old man sounded on the staircase he
      escaped into the garden. The small criminality of this morning <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to their innocent love the lively
      charm of a forbidden joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his other
      occupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding an
      unknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, in
      listening to their quiet prattle. The simplicity of this half-monastic
      life, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown and
      unknowing of the world, touched him keenly. He had believed such morals
      impossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere but in Germany;
      even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in the novels of Auguste
      Lafontaine. Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaret of Goethe&mdash;before
      her fall. Day by day his words, his looks enraptured the poor girl, who
      yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance to the current of love;
      she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes the overhanging branch of a
      willow to draw himself from the river and lie at rest upon its shore. Did
      no dread of a coming absence sadden the happy hours of those fleeting
      days? Daily some little circumstance reminded them of the parting that was
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took his nephew to
      the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country people attach to all
      legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering his rights in his
      father&rsquo;s estate. Terrible renunciation! species of domestic apostasy!
      Charles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make two powers of attorney,&mdash;one
      for des Grassins, the other for the friend whom he had charged with the
      sale of his belongings. After that he attended to all the formalities
      necessary to obtain a passport for foreign countries; and finally, when he
      received his simple mourning clothes from Paris, he sent for the tailor of
      Saumur and sold to him his useless wardrobe. This last act pleased Grandet
      exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now you look like a man prepared to embark and make your fortune,&rdquo; he
      said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain black cloth. &ldquo;Good! very
      good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will believe, monsieur,&rdquo; answered his nephew, &ldquo;that I shall
      always try to conform to my situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful of gold
      which Charles was carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and other
      superfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one in
      Saumur, I wanted to ask you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To buy them?&rdquo; said Grandet, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; I will
      come back and tell you what it is to a fraction. Jeweller&rsquo;s gold,&rdquo;
       examining a long chain, &ldquo;eighteen or nineteen carats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold, which he
      carried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;may I offer you these two buttons? They can
      fasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much the
      fashion just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept without hesitation,&rdquo; she answered, giving him an understanding
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt, here is my mother&rsquo;s thimble; I have always kept it carefully in my
      dressing-case,&rdquo; said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble to Madame
      Grandet, who for many years had longed for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew,&rdquo; said the poor
      mother, whose eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Night and morning in my prayers I
      shall add one for you, the most earnest of all&mdash;for those who travel.
      If I die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-five
      centimes,&rdquo; said Grandet, opening the door. &ldquo;To save you the pain of
      selling them, I will advance the money&mdash;in <i>livres</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word <i>livres</i> on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crown
      prices of six <i>livres</i> are to be accepted as six francs without
      deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dared not propose it to you,&rdquo; answered Charles; &ldquo;but it was most
      repugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in your own
      town. People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleon said. I
      thank you for your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear uncle,&rdquo; resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air, as if
      he feared to wound his feelings, &ldquo;my aunt and cousin have been kind enough
      to accept a trifling remembrance of me. Will you allow me to give you
      these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now? They will remind you of
      a poor fellow who, far away, will always think of those who are henceforth
      all his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lad, my lad, you mustn&rsquo;t rob yourself this way! Let me see, wife, what
      have you got?&rdquo; he added, turning eagerly to her. &ldquo;Ah! a gold thimble. And
      you, little girl? What! diamond buttons? Yes, I&rsquo;ll accept your present,
      nephew,&rdquo; he answered, shaking Charles by the hand. &ldquo;But&mdash;you must let
      me&mdash;pay&mdash;your&mdash;yes, your passage to the Indies. Yes, I wish
      to pay your passage because&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see, my boy?&mdash;in valuing your
      jewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely the
      workmanship is worth something. So let us settle it that I am to give you
      fifteen hundred francs&mdash;in <i>livres</i>; Cruchot will lend them to
      me. I haven&rsquo;t got a copper farthing here,&mdash;unless Perrotet, who is
      behindhand with his rent, should pay up. By the bye, I&rsquo;ll go and see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are really going?&rdquo; said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sad look,
      mingled with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; he said, bowing his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days past, Charles&rsquo;s whole bearing, manners, and speech had
      become those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feels the
      weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gather courage from
      misfortune. He no longer repined, he became a man. Eugenie never augured
      better of her cousin&rsquo;s character than when she saw him come down in the
      plain black clothes which suited well with his pale face and sombre
      countenance. On that day the two women put on their own mourning, and all
      three assisted at a Requiem celebrated in the parish church for the soul
      of the late Guillaume Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and began to
      read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?&rdquo;
       said Eugenie in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never ask such questions, my daughter,&rdquo; said Grandet. &ldquo;What the devil! do
      I tell you my affairs? Why do you poke your nose into your cousin&rsquo;s? Let
      the lad alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I haven&rsquo;t any secrets,&rdquo; said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you&rsquo;ll soon find out that you must hold your
      tongue in business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie,
      drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managed my
      affairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris. All my
      things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the advice of an
      old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a commercial outfit of
      European curiosities which will be sure to be in demand in the Indies. He
      has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is loading for San Domingo. In
      five days, Eugenie, we must bid each other farewell&mdash;perhaps forever,
      at least for years. My outfit and ten thousand francs, which two of my
      friends send me, are a very small beginning. I cannot look to return for
      many years. My dear cousin, do not weight your life in the scales with
      mine; I may perish; some good marriage may be offered to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! indeed, yes!&rdquo; he answered, with a depth of tone that revealed an
      equal depth of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait, Charles&mdash;Good heavens! there is my father at his
      window,&rdquo; she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she saw him,
      she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swing-door;
      then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached the corner
      near Nanon&rsquo;s den, in the darkest end of the passage. There Charles caught
      her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his arm about her waist, he
      made her lean gently upon him. Eugenie no longer resisted; she received
      and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet, withal, the most unreserved of
      kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry you,&rdquo;
       said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up her
      work and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in Madame
      Grandet&rsquo;s prayer-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried Nanon, &ldquo;now they&rsquo;re saying their prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandet bestirred
      himself to testify much interest in his nephew. He became very liberal of
      all that cost him nothing; took pains to find a packer; declared the man
      asked too much for his cases; insisted on making them himself out of old
      planks; got up early in the morning to fit and plane and nail together the
      strips, out of which he made, to his own satisfaction, some strong cases,
      in which he packed all Charles&rsquo;s effects; he also took upon himself to
      send them by boat down the Loire, to insure them, and get them to Nantes
      in proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie with
      frightful rapidity. Sometimes she thought of following her cousin. Those
      who have known that most endearing of all passions,&mdash;the one whose
      duration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortal illness, by
      human chances and fatalities,&mdash;they will understand the poor girl&rsquo;s
      tortures. She wept as she walked in the garden, now so narrow to her, as
      indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed. She launched in thought
      upon the wide expanse of the ocean he was about to traverse. At last the
      eve of his departure came. That morning, in the absence of Grandet and of
      Nanon, the precious case which contained the two portraits was solemnly
      installed in the only drawer of the old cabinet which could be locked,
      where the now empty velvet purse was lying. This deposit was not made
      without a goodly number of tears and kisses. When Eugenie placed the key
      within her bosom she had no courage to forbid the kiss with which Charles
      sealed the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall never leave that place, my friend,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my heart will be always there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Charles, it is not right,&rdquo; she said, as though she blamed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not married?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have thy promise,&mdash;then take mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thine; I am thine forever!&rdquo; they each said, repeating the words twice
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      No promise made upon this earth was ever purer. The innocent sincerity of
      Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow the breakfast was sad. Nanon herself, in spite of the
      gold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, had
      tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas&mdash;oh, may God guide
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to the
      diligence for Nantes. Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, and
      insisted on carrying the young man&rsquo;s carpet-bag. All the tradesmen in the
      tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watch the
      procession, which was joined in the market-place by Maitre Cruchot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie, be sure you don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach
      started, kissing Charles on both cheeks, &ldquo;depart poor, return rich; you
      will find the honor of your father safe. I answer for that myself, I&mdash;Grandet;
      for it will only depend on you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure. Is it not the
      best gift that you could make me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not understanding his uncle&rsquo;s words which he had thus interrupted, Charles
      shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the old miser, while
      Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of her father with all her
      strength. The notary smiled, admiring the sly speech of the old man, which
      he alone had understood. The family stood about the coach until it
      started; then as it disappeared upon the bridge, and its rumble grew
      fainter in the distance, Grandet said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation. Eugenie and her
      mother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they could still see
      the diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to which Charles made
      answer by displaying his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,&rdquo; said
      Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover&rsquo;s handkerchief.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Not to interrupt the current of events which are about to take place in
      the bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast a forestalling
      eye upon the various operations which the goodman carried on in Paris by
      means of Monsieur des Grassins. A month after the latter&rsquo;s departure from
      Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of a certificate of a hundred thousand
      francs a year from his investment in the Funds, bought at eighty francs
      net. The particulars revealed at his death by the inventory of his
      property threw no light upon the means which his suspicious nature took to
      remit the price of the investment and receive the certificate thereof.
      Maitre Cruchot was of opinion that Nanon, unknown to herself, was the
      trusty instrument by which the money was transported; for about this time
      she was absent five days, under a pretext of putting things to rights at
      Froidfond,&mdash;as if the goodman were capable of leaving anything lying
      about or out of order!
    </p>
    <p>
      In all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandet the
      old cooper&rsquo;s intentions were fulfilled to the letter. The Bank of France,
      as everybody knows, affords exact information about all the large fortunes
      in Paris and the provinces. The names of des Grassins and Felix Grandet of
      Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyed the esteem bestowed on
      financial celebrities whose wealth comes from immense and unencumbered
      territorial possessions. The arrival of the Saumur banker for the purpose,
      it was said, of honorably liquidating the affairs of Grandet of Paris, was
      enough to avert the shame of protested notes from the memory of the
      defunct merchant. The seals on the property were taken off in presence of
      the creditors, and the notary employed by Grandet went to work at once on
      the inventory of the assets. Soon after this, des Grassins called a
      meeting of the creditors, who unanimously elected him, conjointly with
      Francois Keller, the head of a rich banking-house and one of those
      principally interested in the affair, as liquidators, with full power to
      protect both the honor of the family and the interests of the claimants.
      The credit of Grandet of Saumur, the hopes he diffused by means of des
      Grassins in the minds of all concerned, facilitated the transactions. Not
      a single creditor proved recalcitrant; no one thought of passing his claim
      to his profit-and-loss account; each and all said confidently, &ldquo;Grandet of
      Saumur will pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six months went by. The Parisians had redeemed the notes in circulation as
      they fell due, and held them under lock and key in their desks. First
      result aimed at by the old cooper! Nine months after this preliminary
      meeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-seven per cent to each
      creditor on his claim. This amount was obtained by the sale of the
      securities, property, and possessions of all kinds belonging to the late
      Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over with scrupulous fidelity.
      Unimpeachable integrity was shown in the transaction. The creditors
      gratefully acknowledged the remarkable and incontestable honor displayed
      by the Grandets. When these praises had circulated for a certain length of
      time, the creditors asked for the rest of their money. It became necessary
      to write a collective letter to Grandet of Saumur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it comes!&rdquo; said the old man as he threw the letter into the fire.
      &ldquo;Patience, my good friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur
      demanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his brother
      should be deposited with a notary, together with acquittances for the
      forty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand under pretence of
      sifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition of the estate. It
      roused at once a variety of difficulties. Generally speaking, the creditor
      is a species of maniac, ready to agree to anything one day, on the next
      breathing fire and slaughter; later on, he grows amicable and easy-going.
      To-day his wife is good-humored, his last baby has cut its first tooth,
      all is well at home, and he is determined not to lose a sou; on the morrow
      it rains, he can&rsquo;t go out, he is gloomy, he says yes to any proposal that
      is made to him, so long as it will put an end to the affair; on the third
      day he declares he must have guarantees; by the end of the month he wants
      his debtor&rsquo;s head, and becomes at heart an executioner. The creditor is a
      good deal like the sparrow on whose tail confiding children are invited to
      put salt,&mdash;with this difference, that he applies the image to his
      claim, the proceeds of which he is never able to lay hold of. Grandet had
      studied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors of his
      brother justified all his calculations. Some were angry, and flatly
      refused to give in their vouchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; so much the better,&rdquo; said Grandet, rubbing his hands over the
      letter in which des Grassins announced the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rights
      should be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved the
      power of ultimately compelling a failure. On this began a long
      correspondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to all
      conditions. By means of this concession the placable creditors were able
      to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason. The deposit was then made,
      but not without sundry complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your goodman,&rdquo; they said to des Grassins, &ldquo;is tricking us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of the
      creditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets of Paris,
      had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever get out
      of that affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used to
      say, is a pretty good devil after all. By the end of the third year des
      Grassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors to agree to
      give up their claims for ten per cent on the two million four hundred
      thousand francs still due by the house of Grandet. Grandet answered that
      the notary and the broker whose shameful failures had caused the death of
      his brother were still living, that they might now have recovered their
      credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to get something out of them
      towards lessening the total of the deficit.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitely estimated at
      a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs. Many negotiations, lasting over
      six months, took place between the creditors and the liquidators, and
      between the liquidators and Grandet. To make a long story short, Grandet
      of Saumur, anxious by this time to get out of the affair, told the
      liquidators, about the ninth month of the fourth year, that his nephew had
      made a fortune in the Indies and was disposed to pay his father&rsquo;s debts in
      full; he therefore could not take upon himself to make any settlement
      without previously consulting him; he had written to him, and was
      expecting an answer. The creditors were held in check until the middle of
      the fifth year by the words, &ldquo;payment in full,&rdquo; which the wily old miser
      threw out from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying with a
      smile and an oath, &ldquo;Those Parisians!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals of
      commerce. When the events of this history bring them once more into
      notice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolved to
      force them into from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet sold out
      his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousand francs in
      gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundred thousand francs
      compound interest which he had derived from the capital. Des Grassins now
      lived in Paris. In the first place he had been made a deputy; then he
      became infatuated (father of a family as he was, though horribly bored by
      the provincial life of Saumur) with a pretty actress at the Theatre de
      Madame, known as Florine, and he presently relapsed into the old habits of
      his army life. It is useless to speak of his conduct; Saumur considered it
      profoundly immoral. His wife was fortunate in the fact of her property
      being settled upon herself, and in having sufficient ability to keep up
      the banking-house in Saumur, which was managed in her name and repaired
      the breach in her fortune caused by the extravagance of her husband. The
      Cruchotines made so much talk about the false position of the quasi-widow
      that she married her daughter very badly, and was forced to give up all
      hope of an alliance between Eugenie Grandet and her son. Adolphe joined
      his father in Paris and became, it was said, a worthless fellow. The
      Cruchots triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband hasn&rsquo;t common sense,&rdquo; said Grandet as he lent Madame des
      Grassins some money on a note securely endorsed. &ldquo;I am very sorry for you,
      for you are a good little woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur,&rdquo; said the poor lady, &ldquo;who could have believed that when he
      left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to his ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all I
      could to prevent him from going. Monsieur le president was most anxious to
      take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we all see why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under no obligation to
      des Grassins.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, and they
      suffer more. Man has strength and the power of exercising it; he acts,
      moves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and sees consolation in
      the future. It was thus with Charles. But the woman stays at home; she is
      always face to face with the grief from which nothing distracts her; she
      goes down to the depths of the abyss which yawns before her, measures it,
      and often fills it with her tears and prayers. Thus did Eugenie. She
      initiated herself into her destiny. To feel, to love, to suffer, to devote
      herself,&mdash;is not this the sum of woman&rsquo;s life? Eugenie was to be in
      all things a woman, except in the one thing that consoles for all. Her
      happiness, picked up like nails scattered on a wall&mdash;to use the fine
      simile of Bossuet&mdash;would never so much as fill even the hollow of her
      hand. Sorrows are never long in coming; for her they came soon. The day
      after Charles&rsquo;s departure the house of Monsieur Grandet resumed its
      ordinary aspect in the eyes of all, except in those of Eugenie, to whom it
      grew suddenly empty. She wished, if it could be done unknown to her
      father, that Charles&rsquo;s room might be kept as he had left it. Madame
      Grandet and Nanon were willing accomplices in this <i>statu quo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t I wish I could see him back!&rdquo; answered Nanon. &ldquo;I took to him!
      He was such a dear, sweet young man,&mdash;pretty too, with his curly
      hair.&rdquo; Eugenie looked at Nanon. &ldquo;Holy Virgin! don&rsquo;t look at me that way,
      mademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character. The
      solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and the dignity of
      the woman beloved, gave to her features an illumination such as painters
      render by a halo. Before the coming of her cousin, Eugenie might be
      compared to the Virgin before the conception; after he had gone, she was
      like the Virgin Mother,&mdash;she had given birth to love. These two Marys
      so different, so well represented by Spanish art, embody one of those
      shining symbols with which Christianity abounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning from Mass on the morning after Charles&rsquo;s departure,&mdash;having
      made a vow to hear it daily,&mdash;Eugenie bought a map of the world,
      which she nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow her
      cousin on his westward way, that she might put herself, were it ever so
      little, day by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and ask him a
      thousand questions,&mdash;&ldquo;Art thou well? Dost thou suffer? Dost thou
      think of me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hast taught me
      to know, shines upon thee?&rdquo; In the mornings she sat pensive beneath the
      walnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with gray lichens, where they
      had said to each other so many precious things, so many trifles, where
      they had built the pretty castles of their future home. She thought of the
      future now as she looked upward to the bit of sky which was all the high
      walls suffered her to see; then she turned her eyes to the angle where the
      sun crept on, and to the roof above the room in which he had slept. Hers
      was the solitary love, the persistent love, which glides into every
      thought and becomes the substance, or, as our fathers might have said, the
      tissue of life. When the would-be friends of Pere Grandet came in the
      evening for their game at cards, she was gay and dissimulating; but all
      the morning she talked of Charles with her mother and Nanon. Nanon had
      brought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her young
      mistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she would say
      to Eugenie,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had a man for myself I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d follow him to hell, yes, I&rsquo;d
      exterminate myself for him; but I&rsquo;ve none. I shall die and never know what
      life is. Would you believe, mamz&rsquo;elle, that old Cornoiller (a good fellow
      all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sake of my money,&mdash;just
      for all the world like the rats who come smelling after the master&rsquo;s
      cheese and paying court to you? I see it all; I&rsquo;ve got a shrewd eye,
      though I am as big as a steeple. Well, mamz&rsquo;elle, it pleases me, but it
      isn&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Two months went by. This domestic life, once so monotonous, was now
      quickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these women
      intimately together. For them Charles lived and moved beneath the grim
      gray rafters of the hall. Night and morning Eugenie opened the
      dressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt. One Sunday morning
      her mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding her cousin&rsquo;s
      features in his mother&rsquo;s face. Madame Grandet was then for the first time
      admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange made by Charles against
      her daughter&rsquo;s treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave him all!&rdquo; cried the poor mother, terrified. &ldquo;What will you say
      to your father on New Year&rsquo;s Day when he asks to see your gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie&rsquo;s eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortal terror
      for more than half the morning. They were so troubled in mind that they
      missed high Mass, and only went to the military service. In three days the
      year 1819 would come to an end. In three days a terrible drama would
      begin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, or dagger, or the spilling of
      blood; but&mdash;as regards the actors in it&mdash;more cruel than all the
      fabled horrors in the family of the Atrides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of us?&rdquo; said Madame Grandet to her daughter, letting her
      knitting fall upon her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two months that
      the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter were not yet
      finished. This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, bore sad results.
      For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in the midst of a sweat
      caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the part of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided your secret
      to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassins in Paris.
      He might have sent us gold pieces like yours; though Grandet knows them
      all, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could we have got the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have pledged my own property. Besides, Monsieur des Grassins
      would have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice. &ldquo;To-morrow
      morning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselves in
      their power. Besides, I have chosen my course. I have done right, I repent
      of nothing. God will protect me. His will be done! Ah! mother, if you had
      read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which mother and
      daughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse by which to
      escape the solemn entrance into Grandet&rsquo;s chamber. The winter of 1819-1820
      was one of the coldest of that epoch. The snow encumbered the roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirring in
      his chamber, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me? The cold is so
      sharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes. At my age I need some
      comforts. Besides,&rdquo; she added, after a slight pause, &ldquo;Eugenie shall come
      and dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressing in her
      cold room in such weather. Then we will go and wish you a happy New Year
      beside the fire in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! a pretty way to begin the new year, Madame
      Grandet! You never talked so much before; but you haven&rsquo;t been sopping
      your bread in wine, I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his own for
      agreeing to his wife&rsquo;s request, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what you ask, Madame Grandet. You
      are a good woman, and I don&rsquo;t want any harm to happen to you at your time
      of life,&mdash;though as a general thing the Bertellieres are as sound as
      a roach. Hein! isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; he added after a pause. &ldquo;Well, I forgive
      them; we got their property in the end.&rdquo; And he coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very gay this morning, monsieur,&rdquo; said the poor woman gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always gay,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,
  Raccommodez votre cuvier!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      he answered, entering his wife&rsquo;s room fully dressed. &ldquo;Yes, on my word, it
      is cold enough to freeze you solid. We shall have a fine breakfast, wife.
      Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled! I am going now to
      get it at the coach-office. There&rsquo;ll be a double napoleon for Eugenie in
      the package,&rdquo; he whispered in Madame Grandet&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I have no gold left,
      wife. I had a few stray pieces&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that&mdash;but
      I had to let them go in business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie,&rdquo; cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      which side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-tempered this
      morning. Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to the master?&rdquo; said Nanon, entering her mistress&rsquo;s room
      to light the fire. &ldquo;First place, he said, &lsquo;Good-morning; happy New Year,
      you big fool! Go and light my wife&rsquo;s fire, she&rsquo;s cold&rsquo;; and then, didn&rsquo;t I
      feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-franc piece, which
      isn&rsquo;t worn one bit? Just look at it, madame! Oh, the kind man! He is a
      good man, that&rsquo;s a fact. There are some people who the older they get the
      harder they grow; but he,&mdash;why he&rsquo;s getting soft and improving with
      time, like your ratafia! He is a good, good man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secret of Grandet&rsquo;s joy lay in the complete success of his
      speculation. Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount which the
      old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fifty thousand
      francs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he had advanced to make
      up the sum required for the investment in the Funds which was to produce a
      hundred thousand francs a year, had now sent him, by the diligence, thirty
      thousand francs in silver coin, the remainder of his first half-year&rsquo;s
      interest, informing him at the same time that the Funds had already gone
      up in value. They were then quoted at eighty-nine; the shrewdest
      capitalists bought in, towards the last of January, at ninety-three.
      Grandet had thus gained in two months twelve per cent on his capital; he
      had simplified his accounts, and would in future receive fifty thousand
      francs interest every six months, without incurring any taxes or costs for
      repairs. He understood at last what it was to invest money in the public
      securities,&mdash;a system for which provincials have always shown a
      marked repugnance,&mdash;and at the end of five years he found himself
      master of a capital of six millions, which increased without much effort
      of his own, and which, joined to the value and proceeds of his territorial
      possessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely colossal. The six
      francs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of some great service
      which the poor servant had rendered to her master unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! where&rsquo;s Pere Grandet going? He has been scurrying about since
      sunrise as if to a fire,&rdquo; said the tradespeople to each other as they
      opened their shops for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porter from
      the coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks, they all
      had their comments to make:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,&rdquo;
       said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll end by buying up Saumur,&rdquo; cried a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mind the cold, he&rsquo;s so wrapped up in his gains,&rdquo; said a wife
      to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! hey! Monsieur Grandet, if that&rsquo;s too heavy for you,&rdquo; said a
      cloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it off your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavy?&rdquo; said the cooper, &ldquo;I should think so; it&rsquo;s all sous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silver sous,&rdquo; said the porter in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between your teeth,&rdquo;
       said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old fox! I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough in
      frosty weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s twenty sous for your New Year, and <i>mum</i>!&rdquo; said Grandet. &ldquo;Be
      off with you! Nanon shall take back your barrow. Nanon, are the linnets at
      church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then lend a hand! go to work!&rdquo; he cried, piling the sacks upon her. In a
      few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shut himself
      in with them. &ldquo;When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall,&rdquo; he said as he
      disappeared. &ldquo;Take the barrow back to the coach-office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The family did not breakfast that day until ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs,&rdquo; said Madame
      Grandet as they got back from Mass. &ldquo;You must pretend to be very chilly.
      We may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculation in
      government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose his
      Parisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to invest in
      this way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds should reach a
      par value. Fatal reverie for Eugenie! As soon as he came in, the two women
      wished him a happy New Year,&mdash;his daughter by putting her arms round
      his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely and with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! my child,&rdquo; he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks. &ldquo;I work
      for you, don&rsquo;t you see? I think of your happiness. Must have money to be
      happy. Without money there&rsquo;s not a particle of happiness. Here! there&rsquo;s a
      new napoleon for you. I sent to Paris for it. On my word of honor, it&rsquo;s
      all the gold I have; you are the only one that has got any gold. I want to
      see your gold, little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is too cold; let us have breakfast,&rdquo; answered Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion. That fat des
      Grassins sent me the pate. Eat as much as you like, my children, it costs
      nothing. Des Grassins is getting along very well. I am satisfied with him.
      The old fish is doing Charles a good service, and gratis too. He is making
      a very good settlement of that poor deceased Grandet&rsquo;s business. Hoo!
      hoo!&rdquo; he muttered, with his mouth full, after a pause, &ldquo;how good it is!
      Eat some, wife; that will feed you for at least two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hungry. I am very poorly; you know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah! you can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger,
      you&rsquo;re a Bertelliere; they are all hearty. You are a bit yellow, that&rsquo;s
      true; but I like yellow, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps less horrible
      to a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what was coming after
      breakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie. The more gleefully the old man
      talked and ate, the more their hearts shrank within them. The daughter,
      however, had an inward prop at this crisis,&mdash;she gathered strength
      through love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For him! for him!&rdquo; she cried within her, &ldquo;I would die a thousand deaths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed with
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear away,&rdquo; said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, breakfast
      was over, &ldquo;but leave the table. We can spread your little treasure upon
      it,&rdquo; he said, looking at Eugenie. &ldquo;Little? Faith! no; it isn&rsquo;t little. You
      possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine francs
      and the forty I gave you just now. That makes six thousand francs, less
      one. Well, now see here, little one! I&rsquo;ll give you that one franc to make
      up the round number. Hey! what are you listening for, Nanon? Mind your own
      business; go and do your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold. You won&rsquo;t refuse
      your father, my little girl, hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two women were dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no gold myself. I had some, but it is all gone. I&rsquo;ll give you in
      return six thousand francs in <i>livres</i>, and you are to put them just
      where I tell you. You mustn&rsquo;t think anything more about your &lsquo;dozen.&rsquo; When
      I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a husband who can give
      you the finest &lsquo;dozen&rsquo; ever seen in the provinces. Now attend to me,
      little girl. There&rsquo;s a fine chance for you; you can put your six thousand
      francs into government funds, and you will receive every six months nearly
      two hundred francs interest, without taxes, or repairs, or frost, or hail,
      or floods, or anything else to swallow up the money. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t
      like to part with your gold, hey, my girl? Never mind, bring it to me all
      the same. I&rsquo;ll get you some more like it,&mdash;like those Dutch coins and
      the <i>portugaises</i>, the rupees of Mogul, and the <i>genovines</i>,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      give you some more on your fete-days, and in three years you&rsquo;ll have got
      back half your little treasure. What&rsquo;s that you say? Look up, now. Come,
      go and get it, the precious metal. You ought to kiss me on the eyelids for
      telling you the secrets and the mysteries of the life and death of money.
      Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, and go, and
      sweat, and multiply&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned
      abruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got <i>my</i> gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not got your gold!&rdquo; cried Grandet, starting up erect, like a
      horse that hears a cannon fired beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Eugenie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the shears of my father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin! Madame is turning pale,&rdquo; cried Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandet, your anger will kill me,&rdquo; said the poor mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta! nonsense; you never die in your family! Eugenie, what
      have you done with your gold?&rdquo; he cried, rushing upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet&rsquo;s knees, &ldquo;my
      mother is ill. Look at her; do not kill her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife&rsquo;s face,
      usually so yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, help me to bed,&rdquo; said the poor woman in a feeble voice; &ldquo;I am
      dying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it was only
      with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, she fell with
      exhaustion at every step. Grandet remained alone. However, in a few
      moments he went up six or eight stairs and called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She soon came, after reassuring her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;you will now tell me what you have done with
      your gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the sole mistress,
      take them back,&rdquo; she answered coldly, picking up the napoleon from the
      chimney-piece and offering it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches&rsquo; pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly never give you anything again. Not so much as that!&rdquo; he
      said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth. &ldquo;Do you dare to
      despise your father? have you no confidence in him? Don&rsquo;t you know what a
      father is? If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all. Where is your
      gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humbly ask
      you to remember that I am twenty-three years old. You have told me often
      that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it. I have used my
      money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it was put to a good
      use&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an inviolable secret,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Have you no secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be something bad if you can&rsquo;t tell it to your father,
      Mademoiselle Grandet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie made a negative motion with her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had it on your birthday, hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and
      reiterated the negative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever such obstinacy! It&rsquo;s a theft,&rdquo; cried Grandet, his voice
      going up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through the house. &ldquo;What!
      here, in my own home, under my very eyes, somebody has taken your gold!&mdash;the
      only gold we have!&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not to know who has got it! Gold is a
      precious thing. Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes, and give&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know what; they do it among the great people, and even among the
      bourgeoisie. But give their gold!&mdash;for you have given it to some one,
      hein?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie was silent and impassive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever such a daughter? Is it possible that I am your father? If
      you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I free&mdash;yes or no&mdash;to do what I would with my own? Was it
      not mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumbfounded by his daughter&rsquo;s logic, Grandet turned pale and stamped and
      swore. When at last he found words, he cried: &ldquo;Serpent! Cursed girl! Ah,
      deceitful creature! You know I love you, and you take advantage of it.
      She&rsquo;d cut her father&rsquo;s throat! Good God! you&rsquo;ve given our fortune to that
      ne&rsquo;er-do-well,&mdash;that dandy with morocco boots! By the shears of my
      father! I can&rsquo;t disinherit you, but I curse you,&mdash;you and your cousin
      and your children! Nothing good will come of it! Do you hear? If it was to
      Charles&mdash;but, no; it&rsquo;s impossible. What! has that wretched fellow
      robbed me?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stir; she won&rsquo;t flinch! She&rsquo;s more Grandet than I&rsquo;m Grandet!
      Ha! you have not given your gold for nothing? Come, speak the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stung him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie, you are here, in my house,&mdash;in your father&rsquo;s house. If you
      wish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me. The priests tell you to
      obey me.&rdquo; Eugenie bowed her head. &ldquo;You affront me in all I hold most dear.
      I will not see you again until you submit. Go to your chamber. You will
      stay there till I give you permission to leave it. Nanon will bring you
      bread and water. You hear me&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother. Grandet, after
      marching two or three times round the garden in the snow without heeding
      the cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to her mother;
      only too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, he climbed the
      stairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in Madame Grandet&rsquo;s room
      just as she was stroking Eugenie&rsquo;s hair, while the girl&rsquo;s face was hidden
      in her motherly bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be comforted, my poor child,&rdquo; she was saying; &ldquo;your father will get over
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no father!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Can it be you and I, Madame
      Grandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child? A fine
      education,&mdash;religious, too! Well! why are you not in your chamber?
      Come, to prison, to prison, mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?&rdquo; said Madame Grandet,
      turning towards him a face that was now red with fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to keep her, carry her off! Clear out&mdash;out of my house,
      both of you! Thunder! where is the gold? what&rsquo;s become of the gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room.
      Grandet turned the key of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;put out the fire in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down in an armchair beside his wife&rsquo;s fire and said to her,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer, Charles,
      who only wanted our money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing about it,&rdquo; she answered, turning to the other side of the
      bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband. &ldquo;I suffer so
      much from your violence that I shall never leave this room, if I trust my
      own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in my coffin. You ought to
      have spared me this suffering, monsieur,&mdash;you, to whom I have caused
      no pain; that is, I think so. Your daughter loves you. I believe her to be
      as innocent as the babe unborn. Do not make her wretched. Revoke your
      sentence. The cold is very severe; you may give her some serious illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not see her, neither will I speak to her. She shall stay in her
      room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father. What the devil!
      shouldn&rsquo;t a father know where the gold in his house has gone to? She owned
      the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutch ducats and the <i>genovines</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown them into
      the water&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the water!&rdquo; cried her husband; &ldquo;into the water! You are crazy,
      Madame Grandet! What I have said is said; you know that well enough. If
      you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump it out
      of her. Women understand how to do that better than we do. Whatever she
      has done, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t eat her. Is she afraid of me? Even if she has
      plastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on the high seas, and
      nobody can get at him, hein!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; Excited by the nervous crisis through which she had
      passed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all her
      tenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenly observed a
      frightful movement of her husband&rsquo;s wen, and, in the very act of replying,
      she changed her speech without changing the tones of her voice,&mdash;&ldquo;But,
      monsieur, I have not more influence over her than you have. She has said
      nothing to me; she takes after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut! Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning. Ta, ta, ta, ta!
      You are setting me at defiance, I do believe. I daresay you are in league
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked fixedly at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on like
      this. I tell you, monsieur,&mdash;and if it were to cost me my life, I
      would say it,&mdash;you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the
      right than you are. That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making
      any but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good
      deeds. Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive her.
      If you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger has done me;
      perhaps you will save my life. My daughter! oh, monsieur, give me back my
      daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall decamp,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the house is not habitable. A mother and
      daughter talking and arguing like that! Broooouh! Pouah! A fine New Year&rsquo;s
      present you&rsquo;ve made me, Eugenie,&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Yes, yes, cry away! What
      you&rsquo;ve done will bring you remorse, do you hear? What&rsquo;s the good of taking
      the sacrament six times every three months, if you give away your father&rsquo;s
      gold secretly to an idle fellow who&rsquo;ll eat your heart out when you&rsquo;ve
      nothing else to give him? You&rsquo;ll find out some day what your Charles is
      worth, with his morocco boots and supercilious airs. He has got neither
      heart nor soul if he dared to carry off a young girl&rsquo;s treasure without
      the consent of her parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and went to
      her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What courage you have had for your daughter&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my child, see where forbidden things may lead us. You forced me to
      tell a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask God to punish only me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, &ldquo;that mademoiselle is to be
      kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that signify, Nanon?&rdquo; said Eugenie tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness! do you suppose I&rsquo;ll eat <i>frippe</i> when the daughter of the
      house is eating dry bread? No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word about all this, Nanon,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as mute as a fish; but you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Grandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a widower, monsieur,&rdquo; said Nanon; &ldquo;it must be disagreeable to
      be a widower with two women in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not speak to you. Hold your jaw, or I&rsquo;ll turn you off! What is that
      I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is grease I&rsquo;m trying out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be some company to-night. Light the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usual hour
      of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet nor her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her,&rdquo; said the old
      wine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins, who
      had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every one inquired,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Madame Grandet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all well,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;her condition seems to me really
      alarming. At her age you ought to take every precaution, Papa Grandet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; said the old man in an absent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all wished him good-night. When the Cruchots got into the street
      Madame des Grassins said to them,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something going on at the Grandets. The mother is very ill
      without her knowing it. The girl&rsquo;s eyes are red, as if she had been crying
      all day. Can they be trying to marry her against her will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie&rsquo;s room in her
      stockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the good soul, &ldquo;Cornoiller gave me a hare. You
      eat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in such frosty
      weather it won&rsquo;t spoil. You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t live on dry bread, I&rsquo;m determined; it
      isn&rsquo;t wholesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Nanon!&rdquo; said Eugenie, pressing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made it downright good and dainty, and <i>he</i> never found it out.
      I bought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I&rsquo;m the mistress of
      my own money&rdquo;; and she disappeared rapidly, fancying she heard Grandet.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife&rsquo;s room
      at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter&rsquo;s name, or
      seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her. Madame Grandet did not
      leave her chamber, and daily grew worse. Nothing softened the old man; he
      remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as a granite rock. He continued to go
      and come about his business as usual; but ceased to stutter, talked less,
      and was more obdurate in business transactions than ever before. Often he
      made mistakes in adding up his figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is going on at the Grandets,&rdquo; said the Grassinists and the
      Cruchotines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened in the Grandet family?&rdquo; became a fixed question which
      everybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties of Saumur.
      Eugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon. If Madame des Grassins said a few
      words to her on coming out of church, she answered in an evasive manner,
      without satisfying any curiosity. However, at the end of two months, it
      became impossible to hide, either from the three Cruchots or from Madame
      des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was in confinement. There came a
      moment when all pretexts failed to explain her perpetual absence. Then,
      though it was impossible to discover by whom the secret had been betrayed,
      all the town became aware that ever since New Year&rsquo;s day Mademoiselle
      Grandet had been kept in her room without fire, on bread and water, by her
      father&rsquo;s orders, and that Nanon cooked little dainties and took them to
      her secretly at night. It was even known that the young woman was not able
      to see or take care of her mother, except at certain times when her father
      was out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet&rsquo;s conduct was severely condemned. The whole town outlawed him, so
      to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness, and they
      excommunicated him. When he passed along the streets, people pointed him
      out and muttered at him. When his daughter came down the winding street,
      accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers, the inhabitants ran
      to the windows and examined with intense curiosity the bearing of the rich
      heiress and her countenance, which bore the impress of angelic gentleness
      and melancholy. Her imprisonment and the condemnation of her father were
      as nothing to her. Had she not a map of the world, the little bench, the
      garden, the angle of the wall? Did she not taste upon her lips the honey
      that love&rsquo;s kisses left there? She was ignorant for a time that the town
      talked about her, just as Grandet himself was ignorant of it. Pious and
      pure in heart before God, her conscience and her love helped her to suffer
      patiently the wrath and vengeance of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      One deep grief silenced all others. Her mother, that gentle, tender
      creature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner to the
      outer as she approached the tomb,&mdash;her mother was perishing from day
      to day. Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause of the
      slow, cruel malady that was wasting her away. This remorse, though her
      mother soothed it, bound her still closer to her love. Every morning, as
      soon as her father left the house, she went to the bedside of her mother,
      and there Nanon brought her breakfast. The poor girl, sad, and suffering
      through the sufferings of her mother, would turn her face to the old
      servant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet not daring to speak of her
      cousin. It was Madame Grandet who first found courage to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is <i>he</i>? Why does <i>he</i> not write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him. You are ill&mdash;you,
      before all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rdquo; meant &ldquo;him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet, &ldquo;I do not wish to live. God protects me
      and enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian.
      Sometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband came to
      breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would say to him
      a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness, yet with the
      firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends a courage she had
      lacked in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health,&rdquo; she would
      answer when he made some commonplace inquiry; &ldquo;but if you really desire to
      render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief, take back your
      daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with the air
      of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under the shelter of a
      gateway till it is over. When these touching, tender, and religious
      supplications had all been made, he would say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather pale to-day, my poor wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stony brow, on
      his closed lips. He was unmoved by the tears which flowed down the white
      cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to his meaningless answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God pardon you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;even as I pardon you! You will some day
      stand in need of mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Madame Grandet&rsquo;s illness he had not dared to make use of his
      terrible &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta!&rdquo; Yet, for all that, his despotic nature was not
      disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by day decreased,
      driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualities which shone upon
      her face. She was all soul. The spirit of prayer seemed to purify her and
      refine those homely features and make them luminous. Who has not seen the
      phenomenon of a like transfiguration on sacred faces where the habits of
      the soul have triumphed over the plainest features, giving them that
      spiritual illumination whose light comes from the purity and nobility of
      the inward thought? The spectacle of this transformation wrought by the
      struggle which consumed the last shreds of the human life of this woman,
      did somewhat affect the old cooper, though feebly, for his nature was of
      iron; if his language ceased to be contemptuous, an imperturbable silence,
      which saved his dignity as master of the household, took its place and
      ruled his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirks and
      complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but however loudly
      public opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servant defended him,
      for the honor of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she would say to his detractors, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t we all get hard as we grow
      old? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he get horny too? Stop telling lies. Mademoiselle lives
      like a queen. She&rsquo;s alone, that&rsquo;s true; but she likes it. Besides, my
      masters have good reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by grief even
      more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, to reconcile
      the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to the Cruchots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!&rdquo; cried Monsieur de
      Bonfons; &ldquo;without any reason, too! Why, that constitutes wrongful cruelty;
      she can contest, as much in as upon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon,&rdquo; said the notary. &ldquo;Set your
      mind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; she said, coming forward with a proud step, &ldquo;I beg you not to
      interfere in this matter. My father is master in his own house. As long as
      I live under his roof I am bound to obey him. His conduct is not subject
      to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world; he is accountable
      to God only. I appeal to your friendship to keep total silence in this
      affair. To blame my father is to attack our family honor. I am much
      obliged to you for the interest you have shown in me; you will do me an
      additional service if you will put a stop to the offensive rumors which
      are current in the town, of which I am accidentally informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; said Madame Grandet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure your
      liberty,&rdquo; answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beauty
      which seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so
      sure of success. He understands your father, and how to manage him. If you
      wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at any cost, be
      reconciled to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun since
      Eugenie&rsquo;s imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down the
      little garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed and arranged
      her hair. When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hid behind its trunk
      and remained for a few moments watching his daughter&rsquo;s movements,
      hesitating, perhaps, between the course to which the obstinacy of his
      character impelled him and his natural desire to embrace his child.
      Sometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench where Charles and Eugenie
      had vowed eternal love; and then she, too, looked at her father secretly
      in the mirror before which she stood. If he rose and continued his walk,
      she sat down obligingly at the window and looked at the angle of the wall
      where the pale flowers hung, where the Venus-hair grew from the crevices
      with the bindweed and the sedum,&mdash;a white or yellow stone-crop very
      abundant in the vineyards of Saumur and at Tours. Maitre Cruchot came
      early, and found the old wine-grower sitting in the fine June weather on
      the little bench, his back against the division wall of the garden,
      engaged in watching his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?&rdquo; he said, perceiving the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to speak to you on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughter Eugenie.
      All the town is talking of her and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the town meddle for? A man&rsquo;s house is his castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse, he
      may fling his money into the gutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your wife is very ill, my friend. You ought to consult Monsieur
      Bergerin; she is likely to die. If she does die without receiving proper
      care, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta! you know a deal about my wife! These doctors, if they
      once get their foot in your house, will come five and six times a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will do as you think best. We are old friends; there is no
      one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concerns you.
      Therefore, I was bound to tell you this. However, happen what may, you
      have the right to do as you please; you can choose your own course.
      Besides, that is not what brings me here. There is another thing which may
      have serious results for you. After all, you can&rsquo;t wish to kill your wife;
      her life is too important to you. Think of your situation in connection
      with your daughter if Madame Grandet dies. You must render an account to
      Eugenie, because you enjoy your wife&rsquo;s estate only during her lifetime. At
      her death your daughter can claim a division of property, and she may
      force you to sell Froidfond. In short, she is her mother&rsquo;s heir, and you
      are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not as wise
      about law as he was about business. He had never thought of a legal
      division of the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly,&rdquo; added Cruchot, in
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out the cause
      of the quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has given away her gold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wasn&rsquo;t it hers?&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all tell me that!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fall to
      his sides with a movement that was truly tragic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going&mdash;for a mere nothing,&rdquo;&mdash;resumed Cruchot, &ldquo;to put
      obstacles in the way of the concessions which you will be obliged to ask
      from your daughter as soon as her mother dies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! my old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife&rsquo;s
      property will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps! The property would have to be
      put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value. Instead of that,
      if you are on good terms with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the shears of my father!&rdquo; cried Grandet, turning pale as he suddenly
      sat down, &ldquo;we will see about it, Cruchot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man looked at
      the notary and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is very hard! It has many griefs! Cruchot,&rdquo; he continued solemnly,
      &ldquo;you would not deceive me? Swear to me upon your honor that all you&rsquo;ve
      told me is legally true. Show me the law; I must see the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor friend,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t I know my own business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is true! I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my own
      daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that your daughter is her mother&rsquo;s heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do we have children? Ah! my wife, I love her! Luckily she&rsquo;s sound and
      healthy; she&rsquo;s a Bertelliere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not a month to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast a dreadful
      look on Cruchot, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother&rsquo;s property. Should she do
      this you would not disinherit her, I presume?&mdash;but if you want to
      come to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly. What I am
      telling you, old man, is against my own interests. What do I live by, if
      it isn&rsquo;t liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions of property?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;ll see! Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more about it, Cruchot; it
      wrings my vitals. Have you received any gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have. My
      good friend, make it up with Eugenie. Don&rsquo;t you know all Saumur is pelting
      you with stones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine. Do be satisfied for once in your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ninety-nine! Are they, Cruchot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, hey! Ninety-nine!&rdquo; repeated the old man, accompanying the notary to
      the street-door. Then, too agitated by what he had just heard to stay in
      the house, he went up to his wife&rsquo;s room and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you. I&rsquo;m
      going to Froidfond. Enjoy yourselves, both of you. This is our
      wedding-day, wife. See! here are sixty francs for your altar at the
      Fete-Dieu; you&rsquo;ve wanted one for a long time. Come, cheer up, enjoy
      yourself, and get well! Hurrah for happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and took his
      wife&rsquo;s head between his hands and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house when you
      refuse to forgive your daughter?&rdquo; she said with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta!&rdquo; said Grandet in a coaxing voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful heaven! Eugenie,&rdquo; cried the mother, flushing with joy, &ldquo;come and
      kiss your father; he forgives you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old man had disappeared. He was going as fast as his legs could
      carry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confused ideas into
      order. Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year. During the last two
      years his avarice had increased upon him, as all the persistent passions
      of men increase at a certain age. As if to illustrate an observation which
      applies equally to misers, ambitious men, and others whose lives are
      controlled by any dominant idea, his affections had fastened upon one
      special symbol of his passion. The sight of gold, the possession of gold,
      had become a monomania. His despotic spirit had grown in proportion to his
      avarice, and to part with the control of the smallest fraction of his
      property at the death of his wife seemed to him a thing &ldquo;against nature.&rdquo;
       To declare his fortune to his daughter, to give an inventory of his
      property, landed and personal, for the purposes of division&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretending to
      examine a vine, &ldquo;it would be cutting my throat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time for dinner,
      resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that he might die
      regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own hands so long as the
      breath was in his body. At the moment when the old man, who chanced to
      have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door and climbed with a
      stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife&rsquo;s room, Eugenie had
      brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oak cabinet and placed it on
      her mother&rsquo;s bed. Mother and daughter, in Grandet&rsquo;s absence, allowed
      themselves the pleasure of looking for a likeness to Charles in the
      portrait of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly his forehead and his mouth,&rdquo; Eugenie was saying as the old
      man opened the door. At the look which her husband cast upon the gold,
      Madame Grandet cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, have pity upon us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upon a
      sleeping child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the
      window. &ldquo;Gold, good gold!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;All gold,&mdash;it weighs two
      pounds! Ha, ha! Charles gave you that for your money, did he? Hein! Why
      didn&rsquo;t you tell me so? It was a good bargain, little one! Yes, you are my
      daughter, I see that&mdash;&rdquo; Eugenie trembled in every limb. &ldquo;This came
      from Charles, of course, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; continued the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; it is not mine. It is a sacred trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta, ta, ta, ta! He took your fortune, and now you can get it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he placed
      the dressing-case on a chair. Eugenie sprang forward to recover it; but
      her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too, pushed her
      back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fell upon her mother&rsquo;s
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur!&rdquo; cried the mother, lifting herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herself close
      to him with clasped hands, &ldquo;father, in the name of all the saints and the
      Virgin! in the name of Christ who died upon the cross! in the name of your
      eternal salvation, father! for my life&rsquo;s sake, father!&mdash;do not touch
      that! It is neither yours nor mine. It is a trust placed in my hands by an
      unhappy relation: I must give it back to him uninjured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a trust, why were you looking at it? To look at it is as bad as
      touching it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, don&rsquo;t destroy it, or you will disgrace me! Father, do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have pity!&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ran upstairs
      terrified. Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are killing me!&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I will
      stab myself with this one! You have already driven my mother to her death;
      you will now kill your child! Do as you choose! Wound for wound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as he looked
      at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do it if she says so!&rdquo; cried Nanon. &ldquo;Be reasonable, monsieur, for
      once in your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternately for an
      instant. Madame Grandet fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! don&rsquo;t you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?&rdquo; cried Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my daughter, we won&rsquo;t quarrel for a box! Here, take it!&rdquo; he
      cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed. &ldquo;Nanon, go and fetch
      Monsieur Bergerin! Come, mother,&rdquo; said he, kissing his wife&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      all over! There! we&rsquo;ve made up&mdash;haven&rsquo;t we, little one? No more dry
      bread; you shall have all you want&mdash;Ah, she opens her eyes! Well,
      mother, little mother, come! See, I&rsquo;m kissing Eugenie! She loves her
      cousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case. But
      don&rsquo;t die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife! Come, try to move!
      Listen! you shall have the finest altar that ever was made in Saumur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!&rdquo; said Madame Grandet in
      a feeble voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do so again, never again,&rdquo; cried her husband; &ldquo;you shall see, my
      poor wife!&rdquo; He went to his inner room and returned with a handful of
      louis, which he scattered on the bed. &ldquo;Here, Eugenie! see, wife! all these
      are for you,&rdquo; he said, fingering the coins. &ldquo;Come, be happy, wife! feel
      better, get well; you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want for anything, nor Eugenie either.
      Here&rsquo;s a hundred <i>louis d&rsquo;or</i> for her. You won&rsquo;t give these away,
      will you, Eugenie, hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; he said, pocketing the coins; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be good
      friends! We will all go down to dinner to-day, and we&rsquo;ll play loto every
      evening for two sous. You shall both be happy. Hey, wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure,&rdquo; said the dying
      woman; &ldquo;but I cannot rise from my bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mother,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know how I love you! and you too,
      my daughter!&rdquo; He took her in his arms and kissed her. &ldquo;Oh, how good it is
      to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her! There, mother, don&rsquo;t
      you see it&rsquo;s all over now? Go and put that away, Eugenie,&rdquo; he added,
      pointing to the case. &ldquo;Go, don&rsquo;t be afraid! I shall never speak of it
      again, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived.
      After an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife was very
      ill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and great care might
      prolong her life until the autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will all that cost much?&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Will she need medicines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much medicine, but a great deal of care,&rdquo; answered the doctor, who
      could scarcely restrain a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Monsieur Bergerin,&rdquo; said Grandet, &ldquo;you are a man of honor, are not
      you? I trust to you! Come and see my wife how and when you think
      necessary. Save my good wife! I love her,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;though
      I never talk about it; I keep things to myself. I&rsquo;m full of trouble.
      Troubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums on his
      affairs in Paris. Why, I&rsquo;m paying through my nose; there&rsquo;s no end to it.
      Adieu, monsieur! If you can save my wife, save her. I&rsquo;ll spare no expense,
      not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Grandet&rsquo;s fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whose
      death threatened more than death to him; in spite of the consideration he
      now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonished wife and
      daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavished upon her
      mother,&mdash;Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end. Every day she
      grew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attacked by
      serious illness are wont to do. She was fragile as the foliage in autumn;
      the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikes athwart the
      withering leaves and gilds them. It was a death worthy of her life,&mdash;a
      Christian death; and is not that sublime? In the month of October, 1822,
      her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for her daughter, seemed to
      find special expression; and then she passed away without a murmur. Lamb
      without spot, she went to heaven, regretting only the sweet companion of
      her cold and dreary life, for whom her last glance seemed to prophesy a
      destiny of sorrows. She shrank from leaving her ewe-lamb, white as
      herself, alone in the midst of a selfish world that sought to strip her of
      her fleece and grasp her treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said as she expired, &ldquo;there is no happiness except in
      heaven; you will know it some day.&rdquo;

      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachment to
      the house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much, where her
      mother had just died. She could not see the window and the chair on its
      castors without weeping. She thought she had mistaken the heart of her old
      father when she found herself the object of his tenderest cares. He came
      in the morning and gave her his arm to take her to breakfast; he looked at
      her for hours together with an eye that was almost kind; he brooded over
      her as though she had been gold. The old man was so unlike himself, he
      trembled so often before his daughter, that Nanon and the Cruchotines, who
      witnessed his weakness, attributed it to his great age, and feared that
      his faculties were giving away. But the day on which the family put on
      their mourning, and after dinner, to which meal Maitre Cruchot (the only
      person who knew his secret) had been invited, the conduct of the old miser
      was explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said to Eugenie when the table had been cleared and
      the doors carefully shut, &ldquo;you are now your mother&rsquo;s heiress, and we have
      a few little matters to settle between us. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Cruchot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary to talk of them to-day, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, little one; I can&rsquo;t bear the uncertainty in which I&rsquo;m placed. I
      think you don&rsquo;t want to give me pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! let us settle it all to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you wish me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little girl, it is not for me to say. Tell her, Cruchot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, nor sell
      the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which he may
      possess. Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released from making the
      inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inherit from your
      mother, and which is now undivided between you and your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell it to
      a mere child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell it my own way, Grandet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my friend. Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me,&mdash;do
      you, little one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?&rdquo; said Eugenie impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;it is necessary to sign this deed, by which you
      renounce your rights to your mother&rsquo;s estate and leave your father the use
      and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the property undivided
      between you, of which he guarantees you the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand a word of what you are saying,&rdquo; returned Eugenie;
      &ldquo;give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, at his
      daughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violent emotion
      that he wiped the sweat from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if, instead of signing this deed, which will
      cost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounce your
      rights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother&rsquo;s property, and would
      trust to me for the future, I should like it better. In that case I will
      pay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs. See, now, you
      could pay for as many masses as you want for anybody&mdash;Hein! a hundred
      francs a month&mdash;in <i>livres</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all you wish, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;it is my duty to point out to you that
      you are despoiling yourself without guarantee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what is all that to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Cruchot! It&rsquo;s settled, all settled,&rdquo; cried Grandet,
      taking his daughter&rsquo;s hand and striking it with his own. &ldquo;Eugenie, you
      won&rsquo;t go back on your word?&mdash;you are an honest girl, hein?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almost
      choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my good child, you restore your father&rsquo;s life; but you only return to
      him that which he gave you: we are quits. This is how business should be
      done. Life is a business. I bless you! you are a virtuous girl, and you
      love your father. Do just what you like in future. To-morrow, Cruchot,&rdquo; he
      added, looking at the horrified notary, &ldquo;you will see about preparing the
      deed of relinquishment, and then enter it on the records of the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herself completed
      her spoliation. At the end of the first year, however, in spite of his
      bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one sou of the hundred
      francs he had so solemnly pledged to her. When Eugenie pleasantly reminded
      him of this, he could not help coloring, and went hastily to his secret
      hiding-place, from whence he brought down about a third of the jewels he
      had taken from his nephew, and gave them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, little one,&rdquo; he said in a sarcastic tone, &ldquo;do you want those for
      your twelve hundred francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father, truly? will you really give them to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you as many more next year,&rdquo; he said, throwing them into her
      apron. &ldquo;So before long you&rsquo;ll get all his gewgaws,&rdquo; he added, rubbing his
      hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance of
      initiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and its management.
      For two consecutive years he made her order the household meals in his
      presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowly and successively
      the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyards and his farms. About
      the third year he had so thoroughly accustomed her to his avaricious
      methods that they had turned into the settled habits of her own life, and
      he was able to leave the household keys in her charge without anxiety, and
      to install her as mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Five years passed away without a single event to relieve the monotonous
      existence of Eugenie and her father. The same actions were performed daily
      with the automatic regularity of clockwork. The deep sadness of
      Mademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if others surmised the
      cause, she herself never uttered a word that justified the suspicions
      which all Saumur entertained about the state of the rich heiress&rsquo;s heart.
      Her only society was made up of the three Cruchots and a few of their
      particular friends whom they had, little by little, introduced into the
      Grandet household. They had taught her to play whist, and they came every
      night for their game. During the year 1827 her father, feeling the weight
      of his infirmities, was obliged to initiate her still further into the
      secrets of his landed property, and told her that in case of difficulty
      she was to have recourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose integrity was well known
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seized by
      paralysis, which made rapid progress. Dr. Bergerin gave him up. Eugenie,
      feeling that she was about to be left alone in the world, came, as it
      were, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly this last living link
      of affection. To her mind, as in that of all loving women, love was the
      whole of life. Charles was not there, and she devoted all her care and
      attention to the old father, whose faculties had begun to weaken, though
      his avarice remained instinctively acute. The death of this man offered no
      contrast to his life. In the morning he made them roll him to a spot
      between the chimney of his chamber and the door of the secret room, which
      was filled, no doubt, with gold. He asked for an explanation of every
      noise he heard, even the slightest; to the great astonishment of the
      notary, he even heard the watch-dog yawning in the court-yard. He woke up
      from his apparent stupor at the day and hour when the rents were due, or
      when accounts had to be settled with his vine-dressers, and receipts
      given. At such times he worked his chair forward on its castors until he
      faced the door of the inner room. He made his daughter open it, and
      watched while she placed the bags of money one upon another in his secret
      receptacles and relocked the door. Then she returned silently to her seat,
      after giving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat pocket and
      fingered from time to time. His old friend the notary, feeling sure that
      the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew the president, if
      Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his attentions; he came
      every day to take Grandet&rsquo;s orders, went on his errands to Froidfond, to
      the farms and the fields and the vineyards, sold the vintages, and turned
      everything into gold and silver, which found their way in sacks to the
      secret hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the old man
      slowly yielded to destruction. He was determined to sit at the
      chimney-corner facing the door of the secret room. He drew off and rolled
      up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon, &ldquo;Put them
      away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had now taken
      refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay his treasures, saying
      to his daughter, &ldquo;Are they there? are they there?&rdquo; in a tone of voice
      which revealed a sort of panic fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my father,&rdquo; she would answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of the gold&mdash;put gold before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he would sit
      for hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a child who, at the
      moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupid contemplation at the same
      object, and like the child, a distressful smile would flicker upon his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It warms me!&rdquo; he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitude stole
      across his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments, the
      old man&rsquo;s eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled at the
      sight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel of silver;
      he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time. When the
      priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that he might kiss the
      Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it; and that last
      effort cost him his life. He called Eugenie, whom he did not see, though
      she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears his stiffening hand, which
      was already cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, bless me!&rdquo; she entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of it all. You will render me an account yonder!&rdquo; he said,
      proving by these last words that Christianity must always be the religion
      of misers.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Eugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, with none
      but Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of being heard and
      understood,&mdash;Nanon the sole being who loved her for herself and with
      whom she could speak of her sorrows. La Grande Nanon was a providence for
      Eugenie. She was not a servant, but a humble friend. After her father&rsquo;s
      death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she possessed an income of
      three hundred thousand francs from landed and personal property in the
      arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions invested at three per cent in
      the Funds (bought at sixty, and now worth seventy-six francs); also two
      millions in gold coin, and a hundred thousand francs in silver
      crown-pieces, besides all the interest which was still to be collected.
      The sum total of her property reached seventeen millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my cousin?&rdquo; was her one thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and exact
      schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with Nanon,
      sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was now a
      memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in, to the
      glass from which her cousin drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanon, we are alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I&rsquo;d go on
      foot to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ocean is between us,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that cold
      dark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang, from
      Nantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of Mademoiselle Grandet.
      Among her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelve hundred francs
      on Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more, became a rich and
      enviable match. In less than a month that good soul passed from single to
      wedded life under the protection of Antoine Cornoiller, who was appointed
      keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet&rsquo;s estates. Madame Cornoiller possessed
      one striking advantage over her contemporaries. Although she was
      fifty-nine years of age, she did not look more than forty. Her strong
      features had resisted the ravages of time. Thanks to the healthy customs
      of her semi-conventual life, she laughed at old age from the
      vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an iron constitution. Perhaps she never
      looked as well in her life as she did on her marriage-day. She had all the
      benefits of her ugliness, and was big and fat and strong, with a look of
      happiness on her indestructible features which made a good many people
      envy Cornoiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fast colors!&rdquo; said the draper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite likely to have children,&rdquo; said the salt merchant. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pickled in
      brine, saving your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing for
      himself,&rdquo; said a third man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came forth from the old house on her way to the parish church,
      Nanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received many compliments as
      she walked down the tortuous street. Eugenie had given her three dozen
      silver forks and spoons as a wedding present. Cornoiller, amazed at such
      magnificence, spoke of his mistress with tears in his eyes; he would
      willingly have been hacked in pieces in her behalf. Madame Cornoiller,
      appointed housekeeper to Mademoiselle Grandet, got as much happiness out
      of her new position as she did from the possession of a husband. She took
      charge of the weekly accounts; she locked up the provisions and gave them
      out daily, after the manner of her defunct master; she ruled over two
      servants,&mdash;a cook, and a maid whose business it was to mend the
      house-linen and make mademoiselle&rsquo;s dresses. Cornoiller combined the
      functions of keeper and bailiff. It is unnecessary to say that the
      women-servants selected by Nanon were &ldquo;perfect treasures.&rdquo; Mademoiselle
      Grandet thus had four servants, whose devotion was unbounded. The farmers
      perceived no change after Monsieur Grandet&rsquo;s death; the usages and customs
      he had sternly established were scrupulously carried out by Monsieur and
      Madame Cornoiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life. Her pale,
      sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, always
      misunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering. Leaving this life
      joyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live; and
      she left in her child&rsquo;s soul some fugitive remorse and many lasting
      regrets. Eugenie&rsquo;s first and only love was a wellspring of sadness within
      her. Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she had given him her heart
      between two kisses furtively exchanged; then he had left her, and a whole
      world lay between them. This love, cursed by her father, had cost the life
      of her mother and brought her only sorrow, mingled with a few frail hopes.
      Thus her upward spring towards happiness had wasted her strength and given
      her nothing in exchange for it. In the life of the soul, as in the
      physical life, there is an inspiration and a respiration; the soul needs
      to absorb the sentiments of another soul and assimilate them, that it may
      render them back enriched. Were it not for this glorious human phenomenon,
      there would be no life for the heart; air would be wanting; it would
      suffer, and then perish. Eugenie had begun to suffer. For her, wealth was
      neither a power nor a consolation; she could not live except through love,
      through religion, through faith in the future. Love explained to her the
      mysteries of eternity. Her heart and the Gospel taught her to know two
      worlds; she bathed, night and day, in the depths of two infinite thoughts,
      which for her may have had but one meaning. She drew back within herself,
      loving, and believing herself beloved. For seven years her passion had
      invaded everything. Her treasuries were not the millions whose revenues
      were rolling up; they were Charles&rsquo;s dressing-case, the portraits hanging
      above her bed, the jewels recovered from her father and proudly spread
      upon a bed of wool in a drawer of the oaken cabinet, the thimble of her
      aunt, used for a while by her mother, which she wore religiously as she
      worked at a piece of embroidery,&mdash;a Penelope&rsquo;s web, begun for the
      sole purpose of putting upon her finger that gold so rich in memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during the period
      of her mourning. Her genuine piety was well known. Consequently the
      Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe, contented
      themselves for the time being with surrounding the great heiress and
      paying her the most affectionate attentions. Every evening the hall was
      filled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang the praises of its
      mistress in every key. She had her doctor in ordinary, her grand almoner,
      her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her prime minister; above all,
      her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain have said much to her. If the
      heiress had wished for a train-bearer, one would instantly have been
      found. She was a queen, obsequiously flattered. Flattery never emanates
      from noble souls; it is the gift of little minds, who thus still further
      belittle themselves to worm their way into the vital being of the persons
      around whom they crawl. Flattery means self-interest. So the people who,
      night after night, assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet&rsquo;s house (they called
      her Mademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in expressions of
      admiration. This concert of praise, never before bestowed upon Eugenie,
      made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her ear became habituated
      to the sound, and however coarse the compliments might be, she soon was so
      accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that if any new-comer had seemed to
      think her plain, she would have felt the reproach far more than she might
      have done eight years earlier. She ended at last by loving the incense,
      which she secretly laid at the feet of her idol. By degrees she grew
      accustomed to be treated as a sovereign and to see her court pressing
      around her every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit, his
      person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised. One or
      another would remark that in seven years he had largely increased his
      fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand francs a year, and
      was surrounded, like the other possessions of the Cruchots, by the vast
      domains of the heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said an habitual visitor, &ldquo;that the Cruchots
      have an income of forty thousand francs among them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, their savings!&rdquo; exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine,
      Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot two hundred
      thousand francs for his practice,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;He will sell it if he is
      appointed <i>juge de paix</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the Civil courts,
      and is taking measures,&rdquo; replied Madame d&rsquo;Orsonval. &ldquo;Monsieur le president
      will certainly be made councillor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a very distinguished man,&rdquo; said another,&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      think so, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the role he
      sought to play. In spite of his forty years, in spite of his dusky and
      crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed in
      youthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff in
      Mademoiselle de Froidfond&rsquo;s house, and came in a white cravat and a shirt
      whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race of turkeys.
      He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke of her as &ldquo;Our
      dear Eugenie.&rdquo; In short, except for the number of visitors, the change
      from loto to whist, and the disappearance of Monsieur and Madame Grandet,
      the scene was about the same as the one with which this history opened.
      The pack were still pursuing Eugenie and her millions; but the hounds,
      more in number, lay better on the scent, and beset the prey more unitedly.
      If Charles could have dropped from the Indian Isles, he would have found
      the same people and the same interests. Madame des Grassins, to whom
      Eugenie was full of kindness and courtesy, still persisted in tormenting
      the Cruchots. Eugenie, as in former days, was the central figure of the
      picture; and Charles, as heretofore, would still have been the sovereign
      of all. Yet there had been some progress. The flowers which the president
      formerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and fete-days had now
      become a daily institution. Every evening he brought the rich heiress a
      huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller placed conspicuously
      in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of the court-yard when the
      visitors had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the peace of
      the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose
      ancient and ruined family might be restored if the heiress would give him
      back his estates through marriage. Madame des Grassins rang the changes on
      the peerage and the title of marquise, until, mistaking Eugenie&rsquo;s
      disdainful smile for acquiescence, she went about proclaiming that the
      marriage with &ldquo;Monsieur Cruchot&rdquo; was not nearly as certain as people
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he does not look older
      than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children, that&rsquo;s true.
      But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; and in times like
      these where you will find a better match? I know it for a fact that Pere
      Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond, intended to graft
      himself upon that stock; he often told me so. He was a deep one, that old
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Nanon,&rdquo; said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, &ldquo;how is it
      that in seven years he has never once written to me?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      While these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making his
      fortune in the Indies. His commercial outfit had sold well. He began by
      realizing a sum of six thousand dollars. Crossing the line had brushed a
      good many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that the best means of
      attaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as in Europe, was to buy
      and sell men. He went to the coast of Africa and bought Negroes, combining
      his traffic in human flesh with that of other merchandise equally
      advantageous to his interests. He carried into this business an activity
      which left him not a moment of leisure. He was governed by the desire of
      reappearing in Paris with all the prestige of a large fortune, and by the
      hope of regaining a position even more brilliant than the one from which
      he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, and studying
      a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modified and had
      become sceptical. He ceased to have fixed principles of right and wrong,
      for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded as a virtue in
      another. In the perpetual struggle of selfish interests his heart grew
      cold, then contracted, and then dried up. The blood of the Grandets did
      not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, and eager for prey. He sold
      Chinamen, Negroes, birds&rsquo; nests, children, artists; he practised usury on
      a large scale; the habit of defrauding custom-houses soon made him less
      scrupulous about the rights of his fellow men. He went to the Island of
      St. Thomas and bought, for a mere song, merchandise that had been captured
      by pirates, and took it to ports where he could sell it at a good price.
      If the pure and noble face of Eugenie went with him on his first voyage,
      like that image of the Virgin which Spanish mariners fastened to their
      masts, if he attributed his first success to the magic influence of the
      prayers and intercessions of his gentle love, later on women of other
      kinds,&mdash;blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indian dancing-girls,&mdash;orgies
      and adventures in many lands, completely effaced all recollection of his
      cousin, of Saumur, of the house, the bench, the kiss snatched in the dark
      passage. He remembered only the little garden shut in with crumbling
      walls, for it was there he learned the fate that had overtaken him; but he
      rejected all connection with his family. His uncle was an old dog who had
      filched his jewels; Eugenie had no place in his heart nor in his thoughts,
      though she did have a place in his accounts as a creditor for the sum of
      six thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet&rsquo;s silence. In the
      Indies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in the
      United States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, that he
      might not compromise his own name. Charles Shepherd could safely be
      indefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man who resolves
      to snatch his fortune <i>quibus cumque viis</i>, and makes haste to have
      done with villany, that he may spend the rest of his life as an honest
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant; and in 1827 Charles
      Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the &ldquo;Marie Caroline,&rdquo; a fine brig
      belonging to a royalist house of business. He brought with him nineteen
      hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which he expected to
      derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint. On the brig he met
      a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X., Monsieur d&rsquo;Aubrion, a
      worthy old man who had committed the folly of marrying a woman of fashion
      with a fortune derived from the West India Islands. To meet the costs of
      Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion&rsquo;s extravagance, he had gone out to the Indies to sell the
      property, and was now returning with his family to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur and Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion, of the house of d&rsquo;Aubrion de Buch, a family
      of southern France, whose last <i>captal</i>, or chief, died before 1789,
      were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs, and they
      possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved to marry without a
      <i>dot</i>,&mdash;the family fortune being scarcely sufficient for the
      demands of her own life in Paris. This was an enterprise whose success
      might have seemed problematical to most men of the world, in spite of the
      cleverness with which such men credit a fashionable woman; in fact, Madame
      d&rsquo;Aubrion herself, when she looked at her daughter, almost despaired of
      getting rid of her to any one, even to a man craving connection with
      nobility. Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion was a long, spare, spindling demoiselle,
      like her namesake the insect; her mouth was disdainful; over it hung a
      nose that was too long, thick at the end, sallow in its normal condition,
      but very red after a meal,&mdash;a sort of vegetable phenomenon which is
      particularly disagreeable when it appears in the middle of a pale, dull,
      and uninteresting face. In one sense she was all that a worldly mother,
      thirty-eight years of age and still a beauty with claims to admiration,
      could have wished. However, to counterbalance her personal defects, the
      marquise gave her daughter a distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic
      treatment which provisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint,
      taught her the art of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners,
      showed her the trick of melancholy glances which interest a man and make
      him believe that he has found a long-sought angel, taught her the
      manoeuvre of the foot,&mdash;letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to
      show its tiny size, at the moment when the nose became aggressively red;
      in short, Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of her
      offspring. By means of full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dresses amply
      trimmed, and high-pressure corsets, she had obtained such curious feminine
      developments that she ought, for the instruction of mothers, to have
      exhibited them in a museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles became very intimate with Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion precisely because she
      was desirous of becoming intimate with him. Persons who were on board the
      brig declared that the handsome Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion neglected no means of
      capturing so rich a son-in-law. On landing at Bordeaux in June, 1827,
      Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion, and Charles lodged at the same
      hotel and started together for Paris. The hotel d&rsquo;Aubrion was hampered
      with mortgages; Charles was destined to free it. The mother told him how
      delighted she would be to give up the ground-floor to a son-in-law. Not
      sharing Monsieur d&rsquo;Aubrion&rsquo;s prejudices on the score of nobility, she
      promised Charles Grandet to obtain a royal ordinance from Charles X. which
      would authorize him, Grandet, to take the name and arms of d&rsquo;Aubrion and
      to succeed, by purchasing the entailed estate for thirty-six thousand
      francs a year, to the titles of Captal de Buch and Marquis d&rsquo;Aubrion. By
      thus uniting their fortunes, living on good terms, and profiting by
      sinecures, the two families might occupy the hotel d&rsquo;Aubrion with an
      income of over a hundred thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, a family,
      and a position at court,&mdash;for I will get you appointed as
      gentleman-of-the-bedchamber,&mdash;he can do what he likes,&rdquo; she said to
      Charles. &ldquo;You can then become anything you choose,&mdash;master of the
      rolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, the
      ambassador himself, if you like. Charles X. is fond of d&rsquo;Aubrion; they
      have known each other from childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverly
      presented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart to heart.
      Believing his father&rsquo;s affairs to have been settled by his uncle, he
      imagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-Germain,&mdash;that
      social object of all desire, where, under shelter of Mademoiselle
      Mathilde&rsquo;s purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comte d&rsquo;Aubrion, very
      much as the Dreux reappeared in Breze. Dazzled by the prosperity of the
      Restoration, which was tottering when he left France, fascinated by the
      splendor of aristocratic ideas, his intoxication, which began on the brig,
      increased after he reached Paris, and he finally determined to take the
      course and reach the high position which the selfish hopes of his would-be
      mother-in-law pointed out to him. His cousin counted for no more than a
      speck in this brilliant perspective; but he went to see Annette. True
      woman of the world, Annette advised her old friend to make the marriage,
      and promised him her support in all his ambitious projects. In her heart
      she was enchanted to fasten an ugly and uninteresting girl on Charles,
      whose life in the West Indies had rendered him very attractive. His
      complexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, like those
      of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and to succeed.
      Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that he now had a
      part to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Des Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage and his
      large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the three hundred
      thousand francs still required to settle his father&rsquo;s debts. He found
      Grandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he had ordered jewels
      for Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion&rsquo;s <i>corbeille</i>, and who was then submitting
      the designs. Charles had brought back magnificent diamonds, and the value
      of their setting, together with the plate and jewelry of the new
      establishment, amounted to more than two hundred thousand francs. He
      received des Grassins, whom he did not recognize, with the impertinence of
      a young man of fashion conscious of having killed four men in as many
      duels in the Indies. Monsieur des Grassins had already called several
      times. Charles listened to him coldly, and then replied, without fully
      understanding what had been said to him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s affairs are not mine. I am much obliged, monsieur, for the
      trouble you have been good enough to take,&mdash;by which, however, I
      really cannot profit. I have not earned two millions by the sweat of my
      brow to fling them at the head of my father&rsquo;s creditors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose that your father&rsquo;s estate were within a few days to be
      declared bankrupt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d&rsquo;Aubrion; you will
      understand, therefore, that what you threaten is of no consequence to me.
      Besides, you know as well as I do that when a man has an income of a
      hundred thousand francs his father has <i>never failed</i>.&rdquo; So saying, he
      politely edged Monsieur des Grassins to the door.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting on the
      little wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love her eternally, and
      where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine. The poor girl was
      happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyous summer air, letting her
      memory recall the great and the little events of her love and the
      catastrophes which had followed it. The sun had just reached the angle of
      the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which no one, through a caprice of the
      mistress, was allowed to touch, though Cornoiller often remarked to his
      wife that &ldquo;it would fall and crush somebody one of these days.&rdquo; At this
      moment the postman knocked, and gave a letter to Madame Cornoiller, who
      ran into the garden, crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, a letter!&rdquo; She gave it to her mistress, adding, &ldquo;Is it the
      one you expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in sound
      from wall to wall of the court and garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris&mdash;from him&mdash;he has returned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment. She trembled so
      violently that she could not break the seal. La Grande Nanon stood before
      her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were like smoke through
      the cracks of her brown face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris? He went from Saumur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, and you&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers. A cheque on the house of
      &ldquo;Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur,&rdquo; fluttered down. Nanon picked
      it up.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Cousin,&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No longer &lsquo;Eugenie,&rsquo;&rdquo; she thought, and her heart quailed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  You&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He once said &lsquo;thou.&rsquo;&rdquo; She folded her arms and dared not read another
      word; great tears gathered in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; asked Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were, he could not write,&rdquo; said Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then read the whole letter, which was as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Cousin,&mdash;You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the
  success of my enterprise. You brought me luck; I have come back
  rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death,
  together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur
  des Grassins. The death of parents is in the course of nature, and
  we must succeed them. I trust you are by this time consoled.
  Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware. Yes, my dear cousin,
  the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me. How could it
  be otherwise? Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon
  life. I was a child when I went away,&mdash;I have come back a man.
  To-day, I think of many I did not dream of then. You are free, my
  dear cousin, and I am free still. Nothing apparently hinders the
  realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide
  from you the situation in which I find myself. I have not
  forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my
  long wanderings, the little wooden seat&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Eugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away and sat
      down on the stone steps of the court.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other
  forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the
  night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier
  to me. Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my
  heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon.
  Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o&rsquo;clock? Yes, I am
  sure of it. I cannot betray so true a friendship,&mdash;no, I must not
  deceive you. An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies
  all my ideas of matrimony. Love in marriage is a delusion. My
  present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey
  all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world.
  Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect
  your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine. I
  will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your
  education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping
  with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for
  myself. My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing,
  to receive much company,&mdash;in short, to live in the world; and I
  think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life. I will
  be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the
  right to understand it and to judge it.

  I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand
  francs. This fortune enables me to marry into the family of
  Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings
  me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His
  Majesty, and a very brilliant position. I will admit to you, my
  dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion; but in
  marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose
  advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles
  are daily coming more and more into favor. Thus in course of time
  my son, when he becomes Marquis d&rsquo;Aubrion, having, as he then will
  have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a
  year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think
  proper to select. We owe ourselves to our children.

  You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my
  heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you. Possibly, after seven
  years&rsquo; separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves;
  but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words. I
  remember all, even words that were lightly uttered,&mdash;words by
  which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful
  and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound. In telling
  you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of
  convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not
  putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress
  of my fate? am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social
  ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and
  simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?

    <p>
      &ldquo;Tan, ta, ta&mdash;tan, ta, ti,&rdquo; sang Charles Grandet to the air of <i>Non
      piu andrai</i>, as he signed himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your devoted cousin, Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder! that&rsquo;s doing it handsomely!&rdquo; he said, as he looked about him for
      the cheque; having found it, he added the words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  P.S.&mdash;I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight
  thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the
  capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me. I
  am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things
  which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing
  gratitude. You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the
  hotel d&rsquo;Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the diligence!&rdquo; said Eugenie. &ldquo;A thing for which I would have laid
      down my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Terrible and utter disaster! The ship went down, leaving not a spar, not a
      plank, on a vast ocean of hope! Some women when they see themselves
      abandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of a rival, they will
      kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth,&mdash;to the scaffold, to
      their tomb. That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of the crime is a great
      passion, which awes even human justice. Other women bow their heads and
      suffer in silence; they go their way dying, resigned, weeping, forgiving,
      praying, and recollecting, till they draw their last breath. This is love,&mdash;true
      love, the love of angels, the proud love which lives upon its anguish and
      dies of it. Such was Eugenie&rsquo;s love after she had read that dreadful
      letter. She raised her eyes to heaven, thinking of the last words uttered
      by her dying mother, who, with the prescience of death, had looked into
      the future with clear and penetrating eyes: Eugenie, remembering that
      prophetic death, that prophetic life, measured with one glance her own
      destiny. Nothing was left for her; she could only unfold her wings,
      stretch upward to the skies, and live in prayer until the day of her
      deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was right,&rdquo; she said, weeping. &ldquo;Suffer&mdash;and die!&rdquo;

      Eugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoided
      passing, as was her custom, through the corridor. But the memory of her
      cousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, where stood a
      certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she used every morning
      at her breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events. Nanon
      announced the cure of the parish church. He was related to the Cruchots,
      and therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons. For some time past
      the old abbe had urged him to speak to Mademoiselle Grandet, from a purely
      religious point of view, about the duty of marriage for a woman in her
      position. When she saw her pastor, Eugenie supposed he had come for the
      thousand francs which she gave monthly to the poor, and she told Nanon to
      go and fetch them; but the cure only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to speak to you about a poor
      girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who, through lack
      of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot think of
      my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself. I am very unhappy; my
      only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough to hold all human
      woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depths and never drain it
      dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you.
      Listen! If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two paths to
      take,&mdash;either leave the world or obey its laws. Obey either your
      earthly destiny or your heavenly destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice. Yes, God has
      sent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for God alone,
      in silence and seclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step.
      Marriage is life, the veil is death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, death,&mdash;a quick death!&rdquo; she said, with dreadful eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death? but you have great obligations to fulfil to society, mademoiselle.
      Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you give clothes and wood in
      winter and work in summer? Your great fortune is a loan which you must
      return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such. To bury yourself in a
      convent would be selfishness; to remain an old maid is to fail in duty. In
      the first place, can you manage your vast property alone? May you not lose
      it? You will have law-suits, you will find yourself surrounded by
      inextricable difficulties. Believe your pastor: a husband is useful; you
      are bound to preserve what God has bestowed upon you. I speak to you as a
      precious lamb of my flock. You love God too truly not to find your
      salvation in the midst of his world, of which you are noble ornament and
      to which you owe your example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. She came incited by
      vengeance and the sense of a great despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! here is monsieur le cure; I am silent.
      I came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferring with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the cure, &ldquo;I leave the field to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur le cure,&rdquo; said Eugenie, &ldquo;come back later; your support is
      very necessary to me just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!&rdquo; said Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Eugenie and the cure together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know about your cousin&rsquo;s return, and his marriage with
      Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion? A woman doesn&rsquo;t carry her wits in her pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment. From this day forth she
      assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had been so
      remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame,&rdquo; she presently said, ironically, &ldquo;no doubt I carry my wits
      in my pocket, for I do not understand you. Speak, say what you mean,
      before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me. Read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie read the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Wife,&mdash;Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and
  has been in Paris about a month&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month!&rdquo; thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. After a pause
      she resumed the letter,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future
  Vicomte d&rsquo;Aubrion. Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and
  the banns are published&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote to me after that!&rdquo; thought Eugenie. She did not conclude the
      thought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done, &ldquo;The
      villain!&rdquo; but though she said it not, contempt was none the less present
      in her mind.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The marriage, however, will not come off. The Marquis d&rsquo;Aubrion
  will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt. I went to
  tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father&rsquo;s
  business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to
  keep the creditor&rsquo;s quiet until the present time. The insolent
  fellow had the face to say to me&mdash;to me, who for five years have
  devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!&mdash;that
  <i>his father&rsquo;s affairs were not his</i>! A solicitor would have had
  the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand
  francs, one per cent on the total of the debts. But patience!
  there are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the
  creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt.

  I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile
  Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family. If
  Monsieur de vicomte d&rsquo;Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care
  for mine. I shall explain my position to the creditors. Still, I
  have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under
  happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this
  matter before you have spoken to her about it&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      There Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said to Madame des Grassins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have the voice and manner of your deceased father,&rdquo; Madame des
      Grassins replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us,&rdquo; said Nanon, producing
      Charles&rsquo;s cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; have the kindness to come with me now, Madame Cornoiller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le cure,&rdquo; said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired by the
      thought she was about to express, &ldquo;would it be a sin to remain a virgin
      after marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within my knowledge.
      If you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of it in his treatise
      &lsquo;De Matrimonio,&rsquo; I shall be able to tell you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father&rsquo;s secret
      room and spent the day there alone, without coming down to dinner, in
      spite of Nanon&rsquo;s entreaties. She appeared in the evening at the hour when
      the usual company began to arrive. Never was the old hall so full as on
      this occasion. The news of Charles&rsquo;s return and his foolish treachery had
      spread through the whole town. But however watchful the curiosity of the
      visitors might be, it was left unsatisfied. Eugenie, who expected
      scrutiny, allowed none of the cruel emotions that wrung her soul to appear
      on the calm surface of her face. She was able to show a smiling front in
      answer to all who tried to testify their interest by mournful looks or
      melancholy speeches. She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy. Towards
      nine o&rsquo;clock the games ended and the players left the tables, paying their
      losses and discussing points of the game as they joined the rest of the
      company. At the moment when the whole party rose to take leave, an
      unexpected and striking event occurred, which resounded through the length
      and breadth of Saumur, from thence through the arrondissement, and even to
      the four surrounding prefectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, monsieur le president,&rdquo; said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons as she
      saw him take his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved by these
      words. The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The president gets the millions,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,&rdquo; cried
      Madame d&rsquo;Orsonval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the trumps in one hand,&rdquo; said the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A love game,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiress mounted
      on her millions as on a pedestal. The drama begun nine years before had
      reached its conclusion. To tell the president, in face of all Saumur, to
      &ldquo;stay,&rdquo; was surely the same thing as proclaiming him her husband. In
      provincial towns social conventionalities are so rigidly enforced than an
      infraction like this constituted a solemn promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le president,&rdquo; said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion when they
      were left alone, &ldquo;I know what pleases you in me. Swear to leave me free
      during my whole life, to claim none of the rights which marriage will give
      you over me, and my hand is yours. Oh!&rdquo; she added, seeing him about to
      kneel at her feet, &ldquo;I have more to say. I must not deceive you. In my
      heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling. Friendship is the only
      sentiment which I can give to a husband. I wish neither to affront him nor
      to violate the laws of my own heart. But you can possess my hand and my
      fortune only at the cost of doing me an inestimable service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready for all things,&rdquo; said the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs,&rdquo; she said, drawing from her
      bosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France. &ldquo;Go to
      Paris,&mdash;not to-morrow, but instantly. Find Monsieur des Grassins,
      learn the names of my uncle&rsquo;s creditors, call them together, pay them in
      full all that was owing, with interest at five per cent from the day the
      debt was incurred to the present time. Be careful to obtain a full and
      legal receipt, in proper form, before a notary. You are a magistrate, and
      I can trust this matter in your hands. You are a man of honor; I will put
      faith in your word, and meet the dangers of life under shelter of your
      name. Let us have mutual indulgence. We have known each other so long that
      we are almost related; you would not wish to render me unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beating and
      wrung with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be your slave!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you obtain the receipts, monsieur,&rdquo; she resumed, with a cold glance,
      &ldquo;you will take them with all the other papers to my cousin Grandet, and
      you will give him this letter. On your return I will keep my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence of
      Mademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste to obey
      her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair and
      burst into tears. All was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening. The
      morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, and together they
      summoned the creditors to meet at the notary&rsquo;s office where the vouchers
      had been deposited. Not a single creditor failed to be present. Creditors
      though they were, justice must be done to them,&mdash;they were all
      punctual. Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name of Mademoiselle Grandet, paid
      them the amount of their claims with interest. The payment of interest was
      a remarkable event in the Parisian commerce of that day. When the receipts
      were all legally registered, and des Grassins had received for his
      services the sum of fifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie, the
      president made his way to the hotel d&rsquo;Aubrion and found Charles just
      entering his own apartment after a serious encounter with his prospective
      father-in-law. The old marquis had told him plainly that he should not
      marry his daughter until all the creditors of Guillaume Grandet had been
      paid in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president gave Charles the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My Cousin,&mdash;Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to
  place in your hands the aquittance for all claims upon my uncle,
  also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the
  sum total of those claims. I have heard of a possible failure, and
  I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry
  Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Aubrion. Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my
  mind and of my manners. I have, it is true, no part in the world;
  I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could
  not give you the pleasures that you seek in it. Be happy,
  according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed
  our love. To make your happiness complete I can only offer you
  your father&rsquo;s honor. Adieu! You will always have a faithful friend
  in your cousin
</pre>
    <p>
      Eugenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man
      could not repress as he received the documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall announce our marriages at the same time,&rdquo; remarked Monsieur de
      Bonfons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you marry Eugenie? Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl. But,&rdquo;
       added Charles, struck with a luminous idea, &ldquo;she must be rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had,&rdquo; said the president, with a mischievous smile, &ldquo;about nineteen
      millions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millions to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles looked at him thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen mil&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur. We shall muster, Mademoiselle Grandet
      and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francs when we
      marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear cousin,&rdquo; said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance, &ldquo;we
      can push each other&rsquo;s fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Here is also a little case which I am
      charged to give into your own hands,&rdquo; he added, placing on the table the
      leather box which contained the dressing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Aubrion, entering the room without
      noticing the president, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pay any attention to what poor Monsieur
      d&rsquo;Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu has turned his
      head. I repeat, nothing shall interfere with the marriage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, madame. The three millions which my father owed were paid
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In money?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to his
      memory&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What folly!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother-in-law. &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; she whispered in
      Grandet&rsquo;s ear, perceiving the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man of business,&rdquo; he answered in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are pushing each other&rsquo;s fortunes already,&rdquo; said the president, taking
      up his hat. &ldquo;Good-by, cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo! I&rsquo;d like to put six inches of
      iron into him!&rdquo; muttered Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president was out of hearing. Three days later Monsieur de Bonfons, on
      his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie. Six months
      after the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Cour royale at
      Angers. Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the gold of certain
      jewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put, together with the
      eight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, into a golden pyx, which
      she gave to the parish church where she had so long prayed for <i>him</i>.
      She now spent her time between Angers and Saumur. Her husband, who had
      shown some public spirit on a certain occasion, became a judge in the
      superior courts, and finally, after a few years, president of them. He was
      anxiously awaiting a general election, in the hope of being returned to
      the Chamber of deputies. He hankered after a peerage; and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will be his cousin, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Nanon, la Grande Nanon,
      Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her mistress,
      who was recounting the honors to which she was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished his patronymic
      of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas. He died eight days
      after his election as deputy of Saumur. God, who sees all and never
      strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordid calculations and the
      legal cleverness with which, <i>accurante Cruchot</i>, he had drawn up his
      marriage contract, in which husband and wife gave to each other, &ldquo;in case
      they should have no children, their entire property of every kind, landed
      or otherwise, without exception or reservation, dispensing even with the
      formality of an inventory; provided that said omission of said inventory
      shall not injure their heirs and assigns, it being understood that this
      deed of gift is, etc., etc.&rdquo; This clause of the contract will explain the
      profound respect which monsieur le president always testified for the
      wishes, and above all, for the solitude of Madame de Bonfons. Women cited
      him as the most considerate and delicate of men, pitied him, and even went
      so far as to find fault with the passion and grief of Eugenie, blaming
      her, as women know so well how to blame, with cruel but discreet
      insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirely alone.
      Poor woman! Is she likely to get well? What is it? Something gastric? A
      cancer?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;She has grown perfectly yellow. She ought to consult some
      celebrated doctor in Paris.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How can she be happy without a child?
      They say she loves her husband; then why not give him an heir?&mdash;in
      his position, too!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know, it is really dreadful! If it is
      the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. Poor president!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Endowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquires
      through constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightedness with
      which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within its sphere,
      Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education to divine thought,
      knew well that the president desired her death that he might step into
      possession of their immense fortune, augmented by the property of his
      uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it had lately pleased God to
      call to himself. The poor solitary pitied the president. Providence
      avenged her for the calculations and the indifference of a husband who
      respected the hopeless passion on which she spent her life because it was
      his surest safeguard. To give life to a child would give death to his
      hopes,&mdash;the hopes of selfishness, the joys of ambition, which the
      president cherished as he looked into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      God thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was a matter
      of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious and good, in holy
      thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and never wearying of such
      deeds. Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-six. She is still
      beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who is nearly forty years of
      age. Her face is white and placid and calm; her voice gentle and
      self-possessed; her manners are simple. She has the noblest qualities of
      sorrow, the saintliness of one who has never soiled her soul by contact
      with the world; but she has also the rigid bearing of an old maid and the
      petty habits inseparable from the narrow round of provincial life. In
      spite of her vast wealth, she lives as the poor Eugenie Grandet once
      lived. The fire is never lighted on her hearth until the day when her
      father allowed it to be lighted in the hall, and it is put out in
      conformity with the rules which governed her youthful years. She dresses
      as her mother dressed. The house in Saumur, without sun, without warmth,
      always in shadow, melancholy, is an image of her life. She carefully
      accumulates her income, and might seem parsimonious did she not disarm
      criticism by a noble employment of her wealth. Pious and charitable
      institutions, a hospital for old age, Christian schools for children, a
      public library richly endowed, bear testimony against the charge of
      avarice which some persons lay at her door. The churches of Saumur owe
      much of their embellishment to her. Madame de Bonfons (sometimes
      ironically spoken of as mademoiselle) inspires for the most part
      reverential respect: and yet that noble heart, beating only with tenderest
      emotions, has been, from first to last, subjected to the calculations of
      human selfishness; money has cast its frigid influence upon that hallowed
      life and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who is all feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none but you to love me,&rdquo; she says to Nanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families. She
      goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions. The
      grandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and the petty
      habits of her early life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not of it;
      who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neither husband nor
      children nor family. Lately there has been some question of her marrying
      again. The Saumur people talk of her and of the Marquis de Froidfond,
      whose family are beginning to beset the rich widow just as, in former
      days, the Cruchots laid siege to the rich heiress. Nanon and Cornoiller
      are, it is said, in the interests of the marquis. Nothing could be more
      false. Neither la Grande Nanon nor Cornoiller has sufficient mind to
      understand the corruptions of the world.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
