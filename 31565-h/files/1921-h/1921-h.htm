    <h2>
      I. AN AMBUSCADE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the year VIII., at the beginning of Vendemiaire, or, to conform
      to our own calendar, towards the close of September, 1799, a hundred or so
      of peasants and a large number of citizens, who had left Fougeres in the
      morning on their way to Mayenne, were going up the little mountain of La
      Pelerine, half-way between Fougeres and Ernee, a small town where
      travellers along that road are in the habit of resting. This company,
      divided into groups that were more or less numerous, presented a
      collection of such fantastic costumes and a mixture of individuals
      belonging to so many and diverse localities and professions that it will
      be well to describe their characteristic differences, in order to give to
      this history the vivid local coloring to which so much value is attached
      in these days,&mdash;though some critics do assert that it injures the
      representation of sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the peasants, in fact the greater number, were barefooted, and
      wore no other garments than a large goatskin, which covered them from the
      neck to the knees, and trousers of white and very coarse linen, the
      ill-woven texture of which betrayed the slovenly industrial habits of the
      region. The straight locks of their long hair mingling with those of the
      goatskin hid their faces, which were bent on the ground, so completely
      that the garment might have been thought their own skin, and they
      themselves mistaken at first sight for a species of the animal which
      served them as clothing. But through this tangle of hair their eyes were
      presently seen to shine like dew-drops in a thicket, and their glances,
      full of human intelligence, caused fear rather than pleasure to those who
      met them. Their heads were covered with a dirty head-gear of red flannel,
      not unlike the Phrygian cap which the Republic had lately adopted as an
      emblem of liberty. Each man carried over his shoulder a heavy stick of
      knotted oak, at the end of which hung a linen bag with little in it. Some
      wore, over the red cap, a coarse felt hat, with a broad brim adorned by a
      sort of woollen chenille of many colors which was fastened round it.
      Others were clothed entirely in the coarse linen of which the trousers and
      wallets of all were made, and showed nothing that was distinctive of the
      new order of civilization. Their long hair fell upon the collar of a round
      jacket with square pockets, which reached to the hips only, a garment
      peculiar to the peasantry of western France. Beneath this jacket, which
      was worn open, a waistcoat of the same linen with large buttons was
      visible. Some of the company marched in wooden shoes; others, by way of
      economy, carried them in their hand. This costume, soiled by long usage,
      blackened with sweat and dust, and less original than that of the other
      men, had the historic merit of serving as a transition between the
      goatskins and the brilliant, almost sumptuous, dress of a few individuals
      dispersed here and there among the groups, where they shone like flowers.
      In fact, the blue linen trousers of these last, and their red or yellow
      waistcoats, adorned with two parallel rows of brass buttons and not unlike
      breast-plates, stood out as vividly among the white linen and shaggy skins
      of their companions as the corn-flowers and poppies in a wheat-field. Some
      of them wore wooden shoes, which the peasants of Brittany make for
      themselves; but the greater number had heavy hobnailed boots, and coats of
      coarse cloth cut in the fashion of the old regime, the shape of which the
      peasants have religiously retained even to the present day. The collars of
      their shirts were held together by buttons in the shape of hearts or
      anchors. The wallets of these men seemed to be better than those of their
      companions, and several of them added to their marching outfit a flask,
      probably full of brandy, slung round their necks by a bit of twine. A few
      burgesses were to be seen in the midst of these semi-savages, as if to
      show the extremes of civilization in this region. Wearing round hats, or
      flapping brims or caps, high-topped boots, or shoes and gaiters, they
      exhibited as many and as remarkable differences in their costume as the
      peasants themselves. About a dozen of them wore the republican jacket
      known by the name of &ldquo;la carmagnole.&rdquo; Others, well-to-do mechanics, no
      doubt, were clothed from head to foot in one color. Those who had most
      pretension to their dress wore swallow-tail coats or surtouts of blue or
      green cloth, more or less defaced. These last, evidently characters,
      marched in boots of various kinds, swinging heavy canes with the air and
      manner of those who take heart under misfortune. A few heads carefully
      powdered, and some queues tolerably well braided showed the sort of care
      which a beginning of education or prosperity inspires. A casual spectator
      observing these men, all surprised to find themselves in one another&rsquo;s
      company, would have thought them the inhabitants of a village driven out
      by a conflagration. But the period and the region in which they were gave
      an altogether different interest to this body of men. Any one initiated
      into the secrets of the civil discords which were then agitating the whole
      of France could easily have distinguished the few individuals on whose
      fidelity the Republic might count among these groups, almost entirely made
      up of men who four years earlier were at war with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other and rather noticeable sign left no doubt upon the opinions which
      divided the detachment. The Republicans alone marched with an air of
      gaiety. As to the other individuals of the troop, if their clothes showed
      marked differences, their faces at least and their attitudes wore a
      uniform expression of ill-fortune. Citizens and peasantry, their faces all
      bore the imprint of deepest melancholy; their silence had something sullen
      in it; they all seemed crushed under the yoke of a single thought,
      terrible no doubt but carefully concealed, for their faces were
      impenetrable, the slowness of their gait alone betraying their inward
      communings. From time to time a few of them, noticeable for the rosaries
      hanging from their necks (dangerous as it was to carry that sign of a
      religion which was suppressed, rather than abolished) shook their long
      hair and raised their heads defiantly. They covertly examined the woods,
      and paths, and masses of rock which flanked the road, after the manner of
      a dog with his nose to the wind trying to scent his game; and then,
      hearing nothing but the monotonous tramp of the silent company, they
      lowered their heads once more with the old expression of despair, like
      criminals on their way to the galleys to live or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The march of this column upon Mayenne, the heterogeneous elements of which
      it was composed, and the divers sentiments which evidently pervaded it,
      will explain the presence of another troop which formed the head of the
      detachment. About a hundred and fifty soldiers, with arms and baggage,
      marched in the advance, commanded by the <i>chief of a half-brigade</i>.
      We may mention here, for the benefit of those who did not witness the
      drama of the Revolution, that this title was made to supersede that of
      colonel, proscribed by patriots as too aristocratic. These soldiers
      belonged to a demi-brigade of infantry quartered at Mayenne. During these
      troublous times the inhabitants of the west of France called all the
      soldiers of the Republic &ldquo;Blues.&rdquo; This nickname came originally from their
      blue and red uniforms, the memory of which is still so fresh as to render
      a description superfluous. A detachment of the Blues was therefore on this
      occasion escorting a body of recruits, or rather conscripts, all
      displeased at being taken to Mayenne where military discipline was about
      to force upon them the uniformity of thought, clothing, and gait which
      they now lacked entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      This column was a contingent slowly and with difficulty raised in the
      district of Fougeres, from which it was due under the levy ordered by the
      executive Directory of the Republic on the preceding 10th Messidor. The
      government had asked for a hundred million of francs and a hundred
      thousand men as immediate reinforcements for the armies then fighting the
      Austrians in Italy, the Prussians in Germany, and menaced in Switzerland
      by the Russians, in whom Suwarow had inspired hopes of the conquest of
      France. The departments of the West, known under the name of La Vendee,
      Brittany, and a portion of Lower Normandy, which had been tranquil for the
      last three years (thanks to the action of General Hoche), after a struggle
      lasting nearly four, seemed to have seized this new occasion of danger to
      the nation to break out again. In presence of such aggressions the
      Republic recovered its pristine energy. It provided in the first place for
      the defence of the threatened departments by giving the responsibility to
      the loyal and patriotic portion of the inhabitants. In fact, the
      government in Paris, having neither troops nor money to send to the
      interior, evaded the difficulty by a parliamentary gasconade. Not being
      able to send material aid to the faithful citizens of the insurgent
      departments, it gave them its &ldquo;confidence.&rdquo; Possibly the government hoped
      that this measure, by arming the insurgents against each other, would
      stifle the insurrection at its birth. This ordinance, the cause of future
      fatal reprisals, was thus worded: &ldquo;Independent companies of troops shall
      be organized in the Western departments.&rdquo; This impolitic step drove the
      West as a body into so hostile an attitude that the Directory despaired of
      immediately subduing it. Consequently, it asked the Assemblies to pass
      certain special measures relating to the independent companies authorized
      by the ordinance. In response to this request a new law had been
      promulgated a few days before this history begins, organizing into regular
      legions the various weak and scattered companies. These legions were to
      bear the names of the departments,&mdash;Sarthe, Orne, Mayenne,
      Ille-et-Vilaine, Morbihan, Loire-Inferieure, and Maine-et-Loire. &ldquo;These
      legions,&rdquo; said the law, &ldquo;will be specially employed to fight the Chouans,
      and cannot, under any pretence, be sent to the frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing irksome details will explain both the weakness of the
      Directory and the movement of this troop of men under escort of the Blues.
      It may not be superfluous to add that these finely patriotic Directorial
      decrees had no realization beyond their insertion among the statutes. No
      longer restrained, as formerly, by great moral ideas, by patriotism, nor
      by terror, which enforced their execution, these later decrees of the
      Republic created millions and drafted soldiers without the slightest
      benefit accruing to its exchequer or its armies. The mainspring of the
      Revolution was worn-out by clumsy handling, and the application of the
      laws took the impress of circumstances instead of controlling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departments of Mayenne and Ille-et-Vilaine were at this time under the
      command of an old officer who, judging on the spot of the measures that
      were most opportune to take, was anxious to wring from Brittany every one
      of her contingents, more especially that of Fougeres, which was known to
      be a hot-bed of &ldquo;Chouannerie.&rdquo; He hoped by this means to weaken its
      strength in these formidable districts. This devoted soldier made use of
      the illusory provisions of the new law to declare that he would equip and
      arm at once all recruits, and he announced that he held at their disposal
      the one month&rsquo;s advanced pay promised by the government to these
      exceptional levies. Though Brittany had hitherto refused all kinds of
      military service under the Republic, the levies were made under the new
      law on the faith of its promises, and with such promptness that even the
      commander was startled. But he was one of those wary old watch-dogs who
      are hard to catch napping. He no sooner saw the contingents arriving one
      after the other than he suspected some secret motive for such prompt
      action. Possibly he was right in ascribing it to the fact of getting arms.
      At any rate, no sooner were the Fougeres recruits obtained than, without
      delaying for laggards, he took immediate steps to fall back towards
      Alencon, so as to be near a loyal neighborhood,&mdash;though the growing
      disaffection along the route made the success of this measure
      problematical. This old officer, who, under instruction of his superiors,
      kept secret the disasters of our armies in Italy and Germany and the
      disturbing news from La Vendee, was attempting on the morning when this
      history begins, to make a forced march on Mayenne, where he was resolved
      to execute the law according to his own good pleasure, and fill the
      half-empty companies of his own brigade with his Breton conscripts. The
      word &ldquo;conscript&rdquo; which later became so celebrated, had just now for the
      first time taken the place in the government decrees of the word <i>requisitionnaire</i>
      hitherto applied to all Republican recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving Fougeres the chief secretly issued to his own men ample
      supplies of ammunition and sufficient rations of bread for the whole
      detachment, so as to conceal from the conscripts the length of the march
      before them. He intended not to stop at Ernee (the last stage before
      Mayenne), where the men of the contingent might find a way of
      communicating with the Chouans who were no doubt hanging on his flanks.
      The dead silence which reigned among the recruits, surprised at the
      manoeuvring of the old republican, and their lagging march up the mountain
      excited to the very utmost the distrust and watchfulness of the chief&mdash;whose
      name was Hulot. All the striking points in the foregoing description had
      been to him matters of the keenest interest; he marched in silence,
      surrounded by five young officers, each of whom respected the evident
      preoccupation of their leader. But just as Hulot reached the summit of La
      Pelerine he turned his head, as if by instinct, to inspect the anxious
      faces of the recruits, and suddenly broke silence. The slow advance of the
      Bretons had put a distance of three or four hundred feet between
      themselves and their escort. Hulot&rsquo;s face contorted after a fashion
      peculiar to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are those dandies up to?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a sonorous
      voice. &ldquo;Creeping instead of marching, I call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his first words the officers who accompanied him turned spasmodically,
      as if startled out of sleep by a sudden noise. The sergeants and corporals
      followed their example, and the whole company paused in its march without
      receiving the wished for &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; Though the officers cast a first look at
      the detachment, which was creeping like an elongated tortoise up the
      mountain of La Pelerine, these young men, all dragged, like many others,
      from important studies to defend their country, and in whom war had not
      yet smothered the sentiment of art, were so much struck by the scene which
      lay spread before their eyes that they made no answer to their chief&rsquo;s
      remark, the real significance of which was unknown to them. Though they
      had come from Fougeres, where the scene which now presented itself to
      their eyes is also visible (but with certain differences caused by the
      change of perspective), they could not resist pausing to admire it again,
      like those dilettanti who enjoy all music the more when familiar with its
      construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the summit of La Pelerine the traveller&rsquo;s eye can range over the
      great valley of Couesnon, at one of the farthest points of which, along
      the horizon, lay the town of Fougeres. From here the officers could see,
      to its full extent, the basin of this intervale, as remarkable for the
      fertility of its soil as for the variety of its aspects. Mountains of
      gneiss and slate rose on all sides, like an ampitheatre, hiding their
      ruddy flanks behind forests of oak, and forming on their declivities other
      and lesser valleys full of dewy freshness. These rocky heights made a vast
      enclosure, circular in form, in the centre of which a meadow lay softly
      stretched, like the lawn of an English garden. A number of evergreen
      hedges, defining irregular pieces of property which were planted with
      trees, gave to this carpet of verdure a character of its own, and one that
      is somewhat unusual among the landscapes of France; it held the teeming
      secrets of many beauties in its various contrasts, the effects of which
      were fine enough to arrest the eye of the most indifferent spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this particular moment the scene was brightened by the fleeting glow
      with which Nature delights at times in heightening the beauty of her
      imperishable creations. While the detachment was crossing the valley, the
      rising sun had slowly scattered the fleecy mists which float above the
      meadows of a September morning. As the soldiers turned to look back, an
      invisible hand seemed to lift from the landscape the last of these veils&mdash;a
      delicate vapor, like a diaphanous gauze through which the glow of precious
      jewels excites our curiosity. Not a cloud could be seen on the wide
      horizon to mark by its silvery whiteness that the vast blue arch was the
      firmament; it seemed, on the contrary, a dais of silk, held up by the
      summits of the mountains and placed in the atmosphere, to protect that
      beautiful assemblage of fields and meadows and groves and brooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group of young officers paused to examine a scene so filled with
      natural beauties. The eyes of some roved among the copses, which the
      sterner tints of autumn were already enriching with their russet tones,
      contrasting the more with the emerald-green of the meadows in which they
      grew; others took note of a different contrast, made by the ruddy fields,
      where the buckwheat had been cut and tied in sheaves (like stands of arms
      around a bivouac), adjoining other fields of rich ploughed land, from
      which the rye was already harvested. Here and there were dark slate roofs
      above which puffs of white smoke were rising. The glittering silver
      threads of the winding brooks caught the eye, here and there, by one of
      those optic lures which render the soul&mdash;one knows not how or why&mdash;perplexed
      and dreamy. The fragrant freshness of the autumn breeze, the stronger
      odors of the forest, rose like a waft of incense to the admirers of this
      beautiful region, who noticed with delight its rare wild-flowers, its
      vigorous vegetation, and its verdure, worthy of England, the very word
      being common to the two languages. A few cattle gave life to the scene,
      already so dramatic. The birds sang, filling the valley with a sweet,
      vague melody that quivered in the air. If a quiet imagination will picture
      to itself these rich fluctuations of light and shade, the vaporous outline
      of the mountains, the mysterious perspectives which were seen where the
      trees gave an opening, or the streamlets ran, or some coquettish little
      glade fled away in the distance; if memory will color, as it were, this
      sketch, as fleeting as the moment when it was taken, the persons for whom
      such pictures are not without charm will have an imperfect image of the
      magic scene which delighted the still impressionable souls of the young
      officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking that the poor recruits must be leaving, with regret, their own
      country and their beloved customs, to die, perhaps, in foreign lands, they
      involuntarily excused a tardiness their feelings comprehended. Then, with
      the generosity natural to soldiers, they disguised their indulgence under
      an apparent desire to examine into the military position of the land. But
      Hulot, whom we shall henceforth call the commandant, to avoid giving him
      the inharmonious title of &ldquo;chief of a half-brigade&rdquo; was one of those
      soldiers who, in critical moments, cannot be caught by the charms of a
      landscape, were they even those of a terrestrial paradise. He shook his
      head with an impatient gesture and contracted the thick, black eyebrows
      which gave so stern an expression to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t they come up?&rdquo; he said, for the second time, in a
      hoarse voice, roughened by the toils of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask why?&rdquo; replied a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words, which seemed to issue from a horn, such as the
      peasants of the western valleys use to call their flocks, the commandant
      turned sharply round, as if pricked by a sword, and beheld, close behind
      him, a personage even more fantastic in appearance than any of those who
      were now being escorted to Mayenne to serve the Republic. This unknown
      man, short and thick-set in figure and broad-shouldered, had a head like a
      bull, to which, in fact, he bore more than one resemblance. His nose
      seemed shorter than it was, on account of the thick nostrils. His full
      lips, drawn from the teeth which were white as snow, his large and round
      black eyes with their shaggy brows, his hanging ears and tawny hair,&mdash;seemed
      to belong far less to our fine Caucasian race than to a breed of
      herbivorous animals. The total absence of all the usual characteristics of
      the social man made that bare head still more remarkable. The face,
      bronzed by the sun (its angular outlines presenting a sort of vague
      likeness to the granite which forms the soil of the region), was the only
      visible portion of the body of this singular being. From the neck down he
      was wrapped in a &ldquo;sarrau&rdquo; or smock, a sort of russet linen blouse, coarser
      in texture than that of the trousers of the less fortunate conscripts.
      This &ldquo;sarrau,&rdquo; in which an antiquary would have recognized the &ldquo;saye,&rdquo; or
      the &ldquo;sayon&rdquo; of the Gauls, ended at his middle, where it was fastened to
      two leggings of goatskin by slivers, or thongs of wood, roughly cut,&mdash;some
      of them still covered with their peel or bark. These hides of the
      nanny-goat (to give them the name by which they were known to the
      peasantry) covered his legs and thighs, and masked all appearance of human
      shape. Enormous sabots hid his feet. His long and shining hair fell
      straight, like the goat&rsquo;s hair, on either side of his face, being parted
      in the centre like the hair of certain statues of the Middle-Ages which
      are still to be seen in our cathedrals. In place of the knotty stick which
      the conscripts carried over their shoulders, this man held against his
      breast as though it were a musket, a heavy whip, the lash of which was
      closely braided and seemed to be twice as long as that of an ordinary
      whip. The sudden apparition of this strange being seemed easily explained.
      At first sight some of the officers took him for a recruit or conscript
      (the words were used indiscriminately) who had outstripped the column. But
      the commandant himself was singularly surprised by the man&rsquo;s presence; he
      showed no alarm, but his face grew thoughtful. After looking the intruder
      well over, he repeated, mechanically, as if preoccupied with anxious
      thought: &ldquo;Yes, why don&rsquo;t they come on? do you know, you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the gloomy apparition, with an accent which proved his
      difficulty in speaking French, &ldquo;there Maine begins&rdquo; (pointing with his
      huge, rough hand towards Ernee), &ldquo;and Bretagne ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he struck the ground sharply with the handle of his heavy whip close
      to the commandant&rsquo;s feet. The impression produced on the spectators by the
      laconic harangue of the stranger was like that of a tom-tom in the midst
      of tender music. But the word &ldquo;harangue&rdquo; is insufficient to reproduce the
      hatred, the desires of vengeance expressed by the haughty gesture of the
      hand, the brevity of the speech, and the look of sullen and cool-blooded
      energy on the countenance of the speaker. The coarseness and roughness of
      the man,&mdash;chopped out, as it seemed by an axe, with his rough bark
      still left on him,&mdash;and the stupid ignorance of his features, made
      him seem, for the moment, like some half-savage demigod. He stood
      stock-still in a prophetic attitude, as though he were the Genius of
      Brittany rising from a slumber of three years, to renew a war in which
      victory could only be followed by twofold mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty fellow this!&rdquo; thought Hulot; &ldquo;he looks to me like the emissary
      of men who mean to argue with their muskets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having growled these words between his teeth, the commandant cast his eyes
      in turn from the man to the valley, from the valley to the detachment,
      from the detachment to the steep acclivities on the right of the road, the
      ridges of which were covered with the broom and gorse of Brittany; then he
      suddenly turned them full on the stranger, whom he subjected to a mute
      interrogation, which he ended at last by roughly demanding, &ldquo;Where do you
      come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eager, piercing eye strove to detect the secrets of that impenetrable
      face, which never changed from the vacant, torpid expression in which a
      peasant when doing nothing wraps himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the country of the Gars,&rdquo; replied the man, without showing any
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marche-a-Terre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call yourself by your Chouan name in defiance of the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre, to use the name he gave to himself, looked at the
      commandant with so genuine an air of stupidity that the soldier believed
      the man had not understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to the recruits from Fougeres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this inquiry Marche-a-Terre replied by the bucolic &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the
      hopeless imbecility of which puts an end to all inquiry. He seated himself
      by the roadside, drew from his smock a few pieces of thin, black
      buckwheat-bread,&mdash;a national delicacy, the dismal delights of which
      none but a Breton can understand,&mdash;and began to eat with stolid
      indifference. There seemed such a total absence of all human intelligence
      about the man that the officers compared him in turn to the cattle
      browsing in the valley pastures, to the savages of America, or the
      aboriginal inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope. Deceived by his behavior,
      the commandant himself was about to turn a deaf ear to his own misgivings,
      when, casting a last prudence glance on the man whom he had taken for the
      herald of an approaching carnage, he suddenly noticed that the hair, the
      smock, and the goatskin leggings of the stranger were full of thorns,
      scraps of leaves, and bits of trees and bushes, as though this Chouan had
      lately made his way for a long distance through thickets and underbrush.
      Hulot looked significantly at his adjutant Gerard who stood beside him,
      pressed his hand firmly, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;We came for wool, but
      we shall go back sheared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers looked at each other silently in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary here to make a digression, or the fears of the commandant
      will not be intelligible to those stay-at-home persons who are in the
      habit of doubting everything because they have seen nothing, and who might
      therefore deny the existence of Marche-a-Terre and the peasantry of the
      West, whose conduct, in the times we are speaking of, was often sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;gars&rdquo; pronounced &ldquo;ga&rdquo; is a relic of the Celtic language. It has
      passed from low Breton into French, and the word in our present speech has
      more ancient associations than any other. The &ldquo;gais&rdquo; was the principal
      weapon of the Gauls; &ldquo;gaisde&rdquo; meant armed; &ldquo;gais&rdquo; courage; &ldquo;gas,&rdquo; force.
      The word has an analogy with the Latin word &ldquo;vir&rdquo; man, the root of
      &ldquo;virtus&rdquo; strength, courage. The present dissertation is excusable as of
      national interest; besides, it may help to restore the use of such words
      as: &ldquo;gars, garcon, garconette, garce, garcette,&rdquo; now discarded from our
      speech as unseemly; whereas their origin is so warlike that we shall use
      them from time to time in the course of this history. &ldquo;She is a famous
      &lsquo;garce&rsquo;!&rdquo; was a compliment little understood by Madame de Stael when it
      was paid to her in a little village of La Vendee, where she spent a few
      days of her exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittany is the region in all France where the manners and customs of the
      Gauls have left their strongest imprint. That portion of the province
      where, even to our own times, the savage life and superstitious ideas of
      our rude ancestors still continue&mdash;if we may use the word&mdash;rampant,
      is called &ldquo;the country of the Gars.&rdquo; When a canton (or district) is
      inhabited by a number of half-savages like the one who has just appeared
      upon the scene, the inhabitants call them &ldquo;the Gars of such or such a
      parish.&rdquo; This classic name is a reward for the fidelity with which they
      struggle to preserve the traditions of the language and manners of their
      Gaelic ancestors; their lives show to this day many remarkable and deeply
      embedded vestiges of the beliefs and superstitious practices of those
      ancient times. Feudal customs are still maintained. Antiquaries find
      Druidic monuments still standing. The genius of modern civilization
      shrinks from forcing its way through those impenetrable primordial
      forests. An unheard-of ferociousness, a brutal obstinacy, but also a
      regard for the sanctity of an oath; a complete ignoring of our laws, our
      customs, our dress, our modern coins, our language, but withal a
      patriarchal simplicity and virtues that are heroic,&mdash;unite in keeping
      the inhabitants of this region more impoverished as to all intellectual
      knowledge than the Redskins, but also as proud, as crafty, and as enduring
      as they. The position which Brittany occupies in the centre of Europe
      makes it more interesting to observe than Canada. Surrounded by light
      whose beneficent warmth never reaches it, this region is like a frozen
      coal left black in the middle of a glowing fire. The efforts made by
      several noble minds to win this glorious part of France, so rich in
      neglected treasures, to social life and to prosperity have all, even when
      sustained by government, come to nought against the inflexibility of a
      population given over to the habits of immemorial routine. This
      unfortunate condition is partly accounted for by the nature of the land,
      broken by ravines, mountain torrents, lakes, and marshes, and bristling
      with hedges or earth-works which make a sort of citadel of every field;
      without roads, without canals, and at the mercy of prejudices which scorn
      our modern agriculture. These will further be shown with all their dangers
      in our present history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picturesque lay of the land and the superstitions of the inhabitants
      prevent the formation of communities and the benefits arising from the
      exchange and comparison of ideas. There are no villages. The rickety
      buildings which the people call homes are sparsely scattered through the
      wilderness. Each family lives as in a desert. The only meetings among them
      are on Sundays and feast-days in the parish church. These silent
      assemblies, under the eye of the rector (the only ruler of these rough
      minds) last some hours. After listening to the awful words of the priest
      they return to their noisome hovels for another week; they leave them only
      to work, they return to them only to sleep. No one ever visits them,
      unless it is the rector. Consequently, it was the voice of the priesthood
      which roused Brittany against the Republic, and sent thousands of men,
      five years before this history begins, to the support of the first
      Chouannerie. The brothers Cottereau, whose name was given to that first
      uprising, were bold smugglers, plying their perilous trade between Laval
      and Fougeres. The insurrections of Brittany had nothing fine or noble
      about them; and it may be truly said that if La Vendee turned its
      brigandage into a great war, Brittany turned war into a brigandage. The
      proscription of princes, the destruction of religion, far from inspiring
      great sacrifices, were to the Chouans pretexts for mere pillage; and the
      events of this intestine warfare had all the savage moroseness of their
      own natures. When the real defenders of the monarchy came to recruit men
      among these ignorant and violent people they vainly tried to give, for the
      honor of the white flag, some grandeur to the enterprises which had
      hitherto rendered the brigands odious; the Chouans remain in history as a
      memorable example of the danger of uprousing the uncivilized masses of the
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch here made of a Breton valley and of the Breton men in the
      detachment of recruits, more especially that of the &ldquo;gars&rdquo; who so suddenly
      appeared on the summit of Mont Pelerine, gives a brief but faithful
      picture of the province and its inhabitants. A trained imagination can by
      the help of these details obtain some idea of the theatre of the war and
      of the men who were its instruments. The flowering hedges of the beautiful
      valleys concealed the combatants. Each field was a fortress, every tree an
      ambush; the hollow trunk of each old willow hid a stratagem. The place for
      a fight was everywhere. Sharpshooters were lurking at every turn for the
      Blues, whom laughing young girls, unmindful of their perfidy, attracted
      within range,&mdash;for had they not made pilgrimages with their fathers
      and their brothers, imploring to be taught wiles, and receiving absolution
      from their wayside Virgin of rotten wood? Religion, or rather the
      fetichism of these ignorant creatures, absolved such murders of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when the struggle had once begun, every part of the country was
      dangerous,&mdash;in fact, all things were full of peril, sound as well as
      silence, attraction as well as fear, the family hearth or the open
      country. Treachery was everywhere, but it was treachery from conviction.
      The people were savages serving God and the King after the fashion of Red
      Indians. To make this sketch of the struggle exact and true at all points,
      the historian must add that the moment Hoche had signed his peace the
      whole country subsided into smiles and friendliness. Families who were
      rending each other to pieces over night, were supping together without
      danger the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very moment that Commandant Hulot became aware of the secret treachery
      betrayed by the hairy skins of Marche-a-Terre, he was convinced that this
      peace, due to the genius of Hoche, the stability of which he had always
      doubted, was at an end. The civil war, he felt, was about to be renewed,&mdash;doubtless
      more terrible than ever after a cessation of three years. The Revolution,
      mitigated by the events of the 9th Thermidor, would doubtless return to
      the old terrors which had made it odious to sound minds. English gold
      would, as formerly, assist in the national discords. The Republic,
      abandoned by young Bonaparte who had seemed to be its tutelary genius, was
      no longer in a condition to resist its enemies from without and from
      within,&mdash;the worst and most cruel of whom were the last to appear.
      The Civil War, already threatened by various partial uprisings, would
      assume a new and far more serious aspect if the Chouans were now to attack
      so strong an escort. Such were the reflections that filled the mind of the
      commander (though less succinctly formulated) as soon as he perceived, in
      the condition of Marche-a-Terre&rsquo;s clothing, the signs of an ambush
      carefully planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence which followed the prophetic remark of the commandant to
      Gerard gave Hulot time to recover his self-possession. The old soldier had
      been shaken. He could not hinder his brow from clouding as he felt himself
      surrounded by the horrors of a warfare the atrocities of which would have
      shamed even cannibals. Captain Merle and the adjutant Gerard could not
      explain to themselves the evident dread on the face of their leader as he
      looked at Marche-a-Terre eating his bread by the side of the road. But
      Hulot&rsquo;s face soon cleared; he began to rejoice in the opportunity to fight
      for the Republic, and he joyously vowed to escape being the dupe of the
      Chouans, and to fathom the wily and impenetrable being whom they had done
      him the honor to employ against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before taking any resolution he set himself to study the position in which
      it was evident the enemy intended to surprise him. Observing that the road
      where the column had halted was about to pass through a sort of gorge,
      short to be sure, but flanked with woods from which several paths appeared
      to issue, he frowned heavily, and said to his two friends, in a low voice
      of some emotion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a devil of a wasp&rsquo;s-nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you fear?&rdquo; asked Gerard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear? Yes, that&rsquo;s it, <i>fear</i>,&rdquo; returned the commandant. &ldquo;I have
      always had a fear of being shot like a dog at the edge of a wood, without
      a chance of crying out &lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Merle, laughing, &ldquo;&lsquo;Who goes there&rsquo; is all humbug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we in any real danger?&rdquo; asked Gerard, as much surprised by Hulot&rsquo;s
      coolness as he was by his evident alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the commandant, in a low voice. &ldquo;We are in the jaws of the
      wolf; it is as dark as a pocket; and we must get some light. Luckily,
      we&rsquo;ve got the upper end of the slope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he moved, with his two officers, in a way to surround
      Marche-a-Terre, who rose quickly, pretending to think himself in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are, vagabond!&rdquo; said Hulot, keeping his eye on the
      apparently indifferent face of the Breton, and giving him a push which
      threw him back on the place where he had been sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; continued Hulot, in a low voice, speaking to the two officers.
      &ldquo;It is time I should tell you that it is all up with the army in Paris.
      The Directory, in consequence of a disturbance in the Assembly, has made
      another clean sweep of our affairs. Those pentarchs,&mdash;puppets, I call
      them,&mdash;those directors have just lost a good blade; Bernadotte has
      abandoned them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will take his place?&rdquo; asked Gerard, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milet-Mureau, an old blockhead. A pretty time to choose to let fools sail
      the ship! English rockets from all the headlands, and those cursed Chouan
      cockchafers in the air! You may rely upon it that some one behind those
      puppets pulled the wire when they saw we were getting the worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How getting the worst of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our armies are beaten at all points,&rdquo; replied Hulot, sinking his voice
      still lower. &ldquo;The Chouans have intercepted two couriers; I only received
      my despatches and last orders by a private messenger sent by Bernadotte
      just as he was leaving the ministry. Luckily, friends have written me
      confidentially about this crisis. Fouche has discovered that the tyrant
      Louis XVIII. has been advised by traitors in Paris to send a leader to his
      followers in La Vendee. It is thought that Barras is betraying the
      Republic. At any rate, Pitt and the princes have sent a man, a <i>ci-devant</i>,
      vigorous, daring, full of talent, who intends, by uniting the Chouans with
      the Vendeans, to pluck the cap of liberty from the head of the Republic.
      The fellow has lately landed in the Morbihan; I was the first to hear of
      it, and I sent the news to those knaves in Paris. &lsquo;The Gars&rsquo; is the name
      he goes by. All those beasts,&rdquo; he added, pointing to Marche-a-Terre,
      &ldquo;stick on names which would give a stomach-ache to honest patriots if they
      bore them. The Gars is now in this district. The presence of that fellow&rdquo;&mdash;and
      again he signed to Marche-a-Terre&mdash;&ldquo;as good as tells me he is on our
      back. But they can&rsquo;t teach an old monkey to make faces; and you&rsquo;ve got to
      help me to get my birds safe into their cage, and as quick as a flash too.
      A pretty fool I should be if I allowed that <i>ci-devant</i>, who dares to
      come from London with his British gold, to trap me like a crow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On learning these secret circumstances, and being well aware that their
      leader was never unnecessarily alarmed, the two officers saw the dangers
      of the position. Gerard was about to ask some questions on the political
      state of Paris, some details of which Hulot had evidently passed over in
      silence, but a sign from his commander stopped him, and once more drew the
      eyes of all three to the Chouan. Marche-a-Terre gave no sign of
      disturbance at being watched. The curiosity of the two officers, who were
      new to this species of warfare, was greatly excited by this beginning of
      an affair which seemed to have an almost romantic interest, and they began
      to joke about it. But Hulot stopped them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke upon the powder-cask; wasting
      courage for nothing is like carrying water in a basket. Gerard,&rdquo; he added,
      in the ear of his adjutant, &ldquo;get nearer, by degrees, to that fellow, and
      watch him; at the first suspicious action put your sword through him. As
      for me, I must take measures to carry on the ball if our unseen
      adversaries choose to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouan paid no attention to the movements of the young officer, and
      continued to play with his whip, and fling out the lash of it as though he
      were fishing in the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the commandant was saying to Merle, in a low voice: &ldquo;Give ten
      picked men to a sergeant, and post them yourself above us on the summit of
      this slope, just where the path widens to a ledge; there you ought to see
      the whole length of the route to Ernee. Choose a position where the road
      is not flanked by woods, and where the sergeant can overlook the country.
      Take Clef-des-Coeurs; he is very intelligent. This is no laughing matter;
      I wouldn&rsquo;t give a farthing for our skins if we don&rsquo;t turn the odds in our
      favor at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Merle was executing this order with a rapidity of which he fully
      understood the importance, the commandant waved his right hand to enforce
      silence on the soldiers, who were standing at ease, and laughing and
      joking around him. With another gesture he ordered them to take up arms.
      When quiet was restored he turned his eyes from one end of the road to the
      other, listened with anxious attention as though he hoped to detect some
      stifled sound, some echo of weapons, or steps which might give warning of
      the expected attack. His black eye seemed to pierce the woods to an
      extraordinary depth. Perceiving no indications of danger, he next
      consulted, like a savage, the ground at his feet, to discover, if
      possible, the trail of the invisible enemies whose daring was well known
      to him. Desperate at seeing and hearing nothing to justify his fears, he
      turned aside from the road and ascended, not without difficulty, one or
      two hillocks. The other officers and the soldiers, observing the anxiety
      of a leader in whom they trusted and whose worth was known to them, knew
      that his extreme watchfulness meant danger; but not suspecting its
      imminence, they merely stood still and held their breaths by instinct.
      Like dogs endeavoring to guess the intentions of a huntsman, whose orders
      are incomprehensible to them though they faithfully obey him, the soldiers
      gazed in turn at the valley, at the woods by the roadside, at the stern
      face of their leader, endeavoring to read their fate. They questioned each
      other with their eyes, and more than one smile ran from lip to lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hulot returned to his men with an anxious look, Beau-Pied, a young
      sergeant who passed for the wit of his company, remarked in a low voice:
      &ldquo;Where the deuce have we poked ourselves that an old trooper like Hulot
      should pull such a gloomy face? He&rsquo;s as solemn as a council of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot gave the speaker a stern look, silence being ordered in the ranks.
      In the hush that ensued, the lagging steps of the conscripts on the
      creaking sand of the road produced a recurrent sound which added a sort of
      vague emotion to the general excitement. This indefinable feeling can be
      understood only by those who have felt their hearts beat in the silence of
      the night from a painful expectation heightened by some noise, the
      monotonous recurrence of which seems to distil terror into their minds,
      drop by drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of the commandant, as he returned to his men, was: &ldquo;Can I be
      mistaken?&rdquo; He glanced, with a concentrated anger which flashed like
      lightning from his eyes, at the stolid, immovable Chouan; a look of savage
      irony which he fancied he detected in the man&rsquo;s eyes, warned him not to
      relax in his precautions. Just then Captain Merle, having obeyed Hulot&rsquo;s
      orders, returned to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did well, captain,&rdquo; said the commandant, &ldquo;to put the few men whose
      patriotism we can count upon among those conscripts at the rear. Take a
      dozen more of our own bravest fellows, with sub-lieutenant Lebrun at their
      head, and make a rear-guard of them; they&rsquo;ll support the patriots who are
      there already, and help to shove on that flock of birds and close up the
      distance between us. I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain disappeared. The commander&rsquo;s eye singled out four men on whose
      intelligence and quickness he knew he might rely, and he beckoned to them,
      silently, with the well-known friendly gesture of moving the right
      forefinger rapidly and repeatedly toward the nose. They came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You served with me under Hoche,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when we brought to reason
      those brigands who call themselves &lsquo;Chasseurs du Roi&rsquo;; you know how they
      hid themselves to swoop down on the Blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this commendation of their intelligence the four soldiers nodded with
      significant grins. Their heroically martial faces wore that look of
      careless resignation to fate which evidenced the fact that since the
      struggle had begun between France and Europe, the ideas of the private
      soldiers had never passed beyond the cartridge-boxes on their backs or the
      bayonets in front of them. With their lips drawn together like a purse
      when the strings are tightened, they looked at their commander attentively
      with inquiring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; continued Hulot, who possessed the art of speaking
      picturesquely as soldier to soldiers, &ldquo;that it won&rsquo;t do for old hares like
      us to be caught napping by the Chouans,&mdash;of whom there are plenty all
      round us, or my name&rsquo;s not Hulot. You four are to march in advance and
      beat up both sides of this road. The detachment will hang fire here. Keep
      your eyes about you; don&rsquo;t get picked off; and bring me news of what you
      find&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he waved his hand towards the suspected heights along the road.
      The four men, by way of thanks raised the backs of their hands to their
      battered old three-cornered hats, discolored by rain and ragged with age,
      and bent their bodies double. One of them, named Larose, a corporal
      well-known to Hulot, remarked as he clicked his musket: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play &lsquo;em a
      tune on the clarinet, commander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started, two to right and two to left of the road; and it was not
      without some excitement that their comrades watched them disappear. The
      commandant himself feared that he had sent them to their deaths, and an
      involuntary shudder seized him as he saw the last of them. Officers and
      soldiers listened to the gradually lessening sound of their footsteps,
      with feelings all the more acute because they were carefully hidden. There
      are occasions when the risk of four lives causes more excitement and alarm
      than all the slain at Jemmapes. The faces of those trained to war have
      such various and fugitive expressions that a painter who has to describe
      them is forced to appeal to the recollections of soldiers and to leave
      civilians to imagine these dramatic figures; for scenes so rich in detail
      cannot be rendered in writing, except at interminable length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the bayonets of the four men were finally lost to sight, Captain
      Merle returned, having executed the commandant&rsquo;s orders with rapidity.
      Hulot, with two or three sharp commands, put his troop in line of battle
      and ordered it to return to the summit of La Pelerine where his little
      advanced-guard were stationed; walking last himself and looking backward
      to note any changes that might occur in a scene which Nature had made so
      lovely, and man so terrible. As he reached the spot where he had left the
      Chouan, Marche-a-Terre, who had seen with apparent indifference the
      various movements of the commander, but who was now watching with
      extraordinary intelligence the two soldiers in the woods to the right,
      suddenly gave the shrill and piercing cry of the <i>chouette</i>, or
      screech-owl. The three famous smugglers already mentioned were in the
      habit of using the various intonations of this cry to warn each other of
      danger or of any event that might concern them. From this came the
      nickname of &ldquo;Chuin&rdquo; which means <i>chouette</i> or owl in the dialect of
      that region. This corrupted word came finally to mean the whole body of
      those who, in the first uprising, imitated the tactics and the signals of
      the smugglers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hulot heard that suspicious sound he stopped short and examined the
      man intently; then he feigned to be taken in by his stupid air, wishing to
      keep him by him as a barometer which might indicate the movements of the
      enemy. He therefore checked Gerard, whose hand was on his sword to
      despatch him; but he placed two soldiers beside the man he now felt to be
      a spy, and ordered them in a loud, clear voice to shoot him at the next
      sound he made. In spite of his imminent danger Marche-a-Terre showed not
      the slightest emotion. The commandant, who was studying him, took note of
      this apparent insensibility, and remarked to Gerard: &ldquo;That fool is not so
      clever as he means to be! It is far from easy to read the face of a
      Chouan, but the fellow betrays himself by his anxiety to show his nerve.
      Ha! ha! if he had only pretended fear I should have taken him for a stupid
      brute. He and I might have made a pair! I came very near falling into the
      trap. Yes, we shall undoubtedly be attacked; but let &lsquo;em come; I&rsquo;m all
      ready now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words in a low voice, rubbing his hands with an air of
      satisfaction, he looked at the Chouan with a jeering eye. Then he crossed
      his arms on his breast and stood in the road with his favorite officers
      beside him awaiting the result of his arrangements. Certain that a fight
      was at hand, he looked at his men composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a row,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied to his comrades in a low voice. &ldquo;See,
      the commandant is rubbing his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In critical situations like that in which the detachment and its commander
      were now placed, life is so clearly at stake that men of nerve make it a
      point of honor to show coolness and self-possession. These are the moments
      in which to judge men&rsquo;s souls. The commandant, better informed of the
      danger than his two officers, took pride in showing his tranquillity. With
      his eyes moving from Marche-a-Terre to the road and thence to the woods he
      stood expecting, not without dread, a general volley from the Chouans,
      whom he believed to be hidden like brigands all around him; but his face
      remained impassible. Knowing that the eyes of the soldiers were turned
      upon him, he wrinkled his brown cheeks pitted with the small-pox, screwed
      his upper lip, and winked his right eye, a grimace always taken for a
      smile by his men; then he tapped Gerard on the shoulder and said: &ldquo;Now
      that things are quiet tell me what you wanted to say just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask what this new crisis means, commandant?&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not new,&rdquo; said Hulot. &ldquo;All Europe is against us, and this time she
      has got the whip hand. While those Directors are fighting together like
      horses in a stable without any oats, and letting the government go to
      bits, the armies are left without supplies or reinforcements. We are
      getting the worst of it in Italy; we&rsquo;ve evacuated Mantua after a series of
      disasters on the Trebia, and Joubert has just lost a battle at Novi. I
      only hope Massena may be able to hold the Swiss passes against Suwarow.
      We&rsquo;re done for on the Rhine. The Directory have sent Moreau. The question
      is, Can he defend the frontier? I hope he may, but the Coalition will end
      by invading us, and the only general able to save the nation is,
      unluckily, down in that devilish Egypt; and how is he ever to get back,
      with England mistress of the Mediterranean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bonaparte&rsquo;s absence doesn&rsquo;t trouble me, commandant,&rdquo; said the young
      adjutant Gerard, whose intelligent mind had been developed by a fine
      education. &ldquo;I am certain the Revolution cannot be brought to naught. Ha!
      we soldiers have a double mission,&mdash;not merely to defend French
      territory, but to preserve the national soul, the generous principles of
      liberty, independence, and rights of human reason awakened by our
      Assemblies and gaining strength, as I believe, from day to day. France is
      like a traveller bearing a light: he protects it with one hand, and
      defends himself with the other. If your news is true, we have never the
      last ten years been so surrounded with people trying to blow it out.
      Principles and nation are in danger of perishing together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, yes,&rdquo; said Hulot, sighing. &ldquo;Those clowns of Directors have managed
      to quarrel with all the men who could sail the ship. Bernadotte, Carnot,
      all of them, even Talleyrand, have deserted us. There&rsquo;s not a single good
      patriot left, except friend Fouche, who holds &lsquo;em through the police.
      There&rsquo;s a man for you! It was he who warned me of a coming insurrection;
      and here we are, sure enough, caught in a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the army doesn&rsquo;t take things in hand and manage the government,&rdquo; said
      Gerard, &ldquo;those lawyers in Paris will put us back just where we were before
      the Revolution. A parcel of ninnies! what do they know about governing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always afraid they&rsquo;ll treat with the Bourbons,&rdquo; said Hulot. &ldquo;Thunder!
      if they did <i>that</i> a pretty pass we should be in, we soldiers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, commandant, it won&rsquo;t come to that,&rdquo; said Gerard. &ldquo;The army, as
      you say, will raise its voice, and&mdash;provided it doesn&rsquo;t choose its
      words from Pichegru&rsquo;s vocabulary&mdash;I am persuaded we have not hacked
      ourselves to pieces for the last ten years merely to manure the flax and
      let others spin the thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interposed Captain Merle, &ldquo;what we have to do now is to act as
      good patriots and prevent the Chouans from communicating with La Vendee;
      for, if they once come to an understanding and England gets her finger
      into the pie, I wouldn&rsquo;t answer for the cap of the Republic, one and
      invisible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the cry of an owl, heard at a distance, interrupted the
      conversation. Again the commander examined Marche-a-Terre, whose
      impassible face still gave no sign. The conscripts, their ranks closed up
      by an officer, now stood like a herd of cattle in the road, about a
      hundred feet distant from the escort, which was drawn up in line of
      battle. Behind them stood the rear-guard of soldiers and patriots, picked
      men, commanded by Lieutenant Lebrun. Hulot cast his eyes over this
      arrangement of his forces and looked again at the picket of men posted in
      advance upon the road. Satisfied with what he saw he was about to give the
      order to march, when the tricolor cockades of the two soldiers he had sent
      to beat the woods to the left caught his eye; he waited therefore till the
      two others, who had gone to the right, should reappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the ball will open over there,&rdquo; he said to his officers, pointing
      to the woods from which the two men did not emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the first two made their report Hulot&rsquo;s attention was distracted
      momentarily from Marche-a-Terre. The Chouan at once sent his owl&rsquo;s-cry to
      an apparently vast distance, and before the men who guarded him could
      raise their muskets and take aim he had struck them a blow with his whip
      which felled them, and rushed away. A terrible discharge of fire-arms from
      the woods just above the place where the Chouan had been sitting brought
      down six or eight soldiers. Marche-a-Terre, at whom several men had fired
      without touching him, vanished into the woods after climbing the slope
      with the agility of a wild-cat; as he did so his sabots rolled into the
      ditch and his feet were seen to be shod with the thick, hobnailed boots
      always worn by the Chouans.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first cries uttered by the Chouans, the conscripts sprang into the
      woods to the right like a flock of birds taking flight at the approach of
      a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire on those scoundrels!&rdquo; cried Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company fired, but the conscripts knew well how to shelter themselves
      behind trees, and before the soldiers could reload they were out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of <i>decreeing</i> levies in the departments?&rdquo; said
      Hulot. &ldquo;It is only such idiots as the Directory who would expect any good
      of a draft in this region. The Assembly had much better stop voting more
      shoes and money and ammunition, and see that we get what belongs to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the two skirmishers sent out on the right were seen
      returning with evident difficulty. The one that was least wounded
      supported his comrade, whose blood was moistening the earth. The two poor
      fellows were half-way down the slope when Marche-a-Terre showed his ugly
      face, and took so true an aim that both Blues fell together and rolled
      heavily into the ditch. The Chouan&rsquo;s monstrous head was no sooner seen
      than thirty muzzles were levelled at him, but, like a figure in a
      pantomime, he disappeared in a second among the tufts of gorse. These
      events, which have taken so many words to tell, happened instantaneously,
      and in another moment the rear-guard of patriots and soldiers had joined
      the main body of the escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company moved quickly to the higher and more open ground on which the
      picket guard was already stationed. There, the commander formed his troop
      once more into line of battle; but, as the Chouans made no further hostile
      demonstrations, he began to think that the deliverance of the conscripts
      might have been the sole object of the ambuscade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their cries,&rdquo; he said to his two friends, &ldquo;prove that they are not
      numerous. We&rsquo;ll advance at a quick step, and possibly we may be able to
      reach Ernee without getting them on our backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were overheard by one of the patriot conscripts, who stepped
      from the ranks, and said respectfully:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, I have already fought the Chouans; may I be allowed a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lawyer,&rdquo; whispered Hulot to Merle. &ldquo;They always want to harangue. Argue
      away,&rdquo; he said to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, the Chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped
      recruits. Now, if we try to outmarch them, they will catch us in the woods
      and shoot every one of us before we can get to Ernee. We must argue, as
      you call it, with cartridges. During the skirmish, which will last more
      time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch the
      National Guard and the militia from Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think there are a good many Chouans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge for yourself, citizen commander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led Hulot to a place where the sand had been stirred as with a rake;
      then he took him to the opening of a wood-path, where the leaves were
      scattered and trampled into the earth,&mdash;unmistakable signs of the
      passage of a large body of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were the &lsquo;gars&rsquo; from Vitre,&rdquo; said the man, who came himself from
      Fougeres; &ldquo;they are on their way to Lower Normandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudin, commander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Gudin, I make you a corporal. You seem to me trustworthy.
      Select a man to send to Fougeres; but stay yourself with me. In the first
      place, however, take two or three of your comrades and bring in the
      muskets and ammunition of the poor fellows those brigands have rolled into
      the ditch. These Bretons,&rdquo; added Hulot to Gerard, &ldquo;will make famous
      infantry if they take to rations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gudin&rsquo;s emissary started on a run to Fougeres by a wood-road to the left;
      the soldiers looked to their arms, and awaited an attack; the commandant
      passed along their line, smiling to them, and then placed himself with his
      officers, a little in front of it. Silence fell once more, but it was of
      short duration. Three hundred or more Chouans, their clothing identical
      with that of the late recruits, burst from the woods to the right with
      actual howls and planted themselves, without any semblance of order, on
      the road directly in front of the feeble detachment of the Blues. The
      commandant thereupon ranged his soldiers in two equal parts, each with a
      front of ten men. Between them, he placed the twelve recruits, to whom he
      hastily gave arms, putting himself at their head. This little centre was
      protected by the two wings, of twenty-five men each, which manoeuvred on
      either side of the road under the orders of Merle and Gerard; their object
      being to catch the Chouans on the flank and prevent them from posting
      themselves as sharp-shooters among the trees, where they could pick off
      the Blues without risk to themselves; for in these wars the Republican
      troops never knew where to look for an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrangements, hastily made, gave confidence to the soldiers, and
      they advanced in silence upon the Chouans. At the end of a few seconds
      each side fired, with the loss of several men. At this moment the two
      wings of the Republicans, to whom the Chouans had nothing to oppose, came
      upon their flanks, and, with a close, quick volley, sent death and
      disorder among the enemy. This manoeuvre very nearly equalized the
      numerical strength of the two parties. But the Chouan nature was so
      intrepid, their will so firm, that they did not give way; their losses
      scarcely staggered them; they simply closed up and attempted to surround
      the dark and well-formed little party of the Blues, which covered so
      little ground that it looked from a distance like a queen-bee surrounded
      by the swarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans might have carried the day at this moment if the two wings
      commanded by Merle and Gerard had not succeeded in getting in two volleys
      which took them diagonally on their rear. The Blues of the two wings ought
      to have remained in position and continued to pick off in this way their
      terrible enemies; but excited by the danger of their little main body,
      then completely surrounded by the Chouans, they flung themselves headlong
      into the road with fixed bayonets and made the battle even for a few
      moments. Both sides fought with a stubbornness intensified by the cruelty
      and fury of the partisan spirit which made this war exceptional. Each man,
      observant of danger, was silent. The scene was gloomy and cold as death
      itself. Nothing was heard through the clash of arms and the grinding of
      the sand under foot but the moans and exclamations of those who fell,
      either dead or badly wounded. The twelve loyal recruits in the republican
      main body protected the commandant (who was guiding his men and giving
      orders) with such courage that more than once several soldiers called out
      &ldquo;Bravo, conscripts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot, imperturbable and with an eye to everything, presently remarked
      among the Chouans a man who, like himself, was evidently surrounded by
      picked men, and was therefore, no doubt, the leader of the attacking
      party. He was eager to see this man distinctly, and he made many efforts
      to distinguish his features, but in vain; they were hidden by the red caps
      and broad-brimmed hats of those about him. Hulot did, however, see
      Marche-a-Terre beside this leader, repeating his orders in a hoarse voice,
      his own carbine, meanwhile, being far from inactive. The commandant grew
      impatient at being thus baffled. Waving his sword, he urged on the
      recruits and charged the centre of the Chouans with such fury that he
      broke through their line and came close to their chief, whose face,
      however, was still hidden by a broad-brimmed felt hat with a white
      cockade. But the invisible leader, surprised at so bold an attack,
      retreated a step or two and raised his hat abruptly, thus enabling Hulot
      to get a hasty idea of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was young,&mdash;Hulot thought him to be about twenty-five; he wore a
      hunting-jacket of green cloth, and a white belt containing pistols. His
      heavy shoes were hobnailed like those of the Chouans; leather leggings
      came to his knees covering the ends of his breeches of very coarse
      drilling, and completing a costume which showed off a slender and
      well-poised figure of medium height. Furious that the Blues should thus
      have approached him, he pulled his hat again over his face and sprang
      towards them. But he was instantly surrounded by Marche-a-Terre and
      several Chouans. Hulot thought he perceived between the heads which
      clustered about this young leader, a broad red ribbon worn across his
      chest. The eyes of the commandant, caught by this royal decoration (then
      almost forgotten by republicans), turned quickly to the young man&rsquo;s face,
      which, however, he soon lost sight of under the necessity of controlling
      and protecting his own little troop. Though he had barely time to notice a
      pair of brilliant eyes (the color of which escaped him), fair hair and
      delicate features bronzed by the sun, he was much struck by the dazzling
      whiteness of the neck, relieved by a black cravat carelessly knotted. The
      fiery attitude of the young leader proved him to be a soldier of the stamp
      of those who bring a certain conventional poesy into battle. His
      well-gloved hand waved above his head a sword which gleamed in the
      sunlight. His whole person gave an impression both of elegance and
      strength. An air of passionate self-devotion, enhanced by the charms of
      youth and distinguished manners, made this <i>emigre</i> a graceful image
      of the French <i>noblesse</i>. He presented a strong contrast to Hulot,
      who, ten feet distant from him, was quite as vivid an image of the
      vigorous Republic for which the old soldier was fighting; his stern face,
      his well-worn blue uniform with its shabby red facings and its blackened
      epaulettes hanging back of his shoulders, being visible signs of its needs
      and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graceful attitude and expression of the young man were not lost on the
      commandant, who exclaimed as he pressed towards him: &ldquo;Come on,
      opera-dancer, come on, and let me crush you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The royalist leader, provoked by his momentary disadvantage, advanced with
      an angry movement, but at the same moment the men who were about him
      rushed forward and flung themselves with fury on the Blues. Suddenly a
      soft, clear voice was heard above the din of battle saying: &ldquo;Here died
      Saint-Lescure! Shall we not avenge him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the magic words the efforts of the Chouans became terrible, and the
      soldiers of the Republic had great difficulty in maintaining themselves
      without breaking their little line of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t a young man,&rdquo; thought Hulot, as he retreated step by step,
      &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t have been attacked in this way. Who ever heard of the
      Chouans fighting an open battle? Well, all the better! they won&rsquo;t shoot us
      off like dogs along the road.&rdquo; Then, raising his voice till it echoed
      through the woods, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Come on, my men! Shall we let ourselves
      be <i>fooled</i> by those brigands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word here given is but a feeble equivalent of the one the brave
      commandant used; but every veteran can substitute the real one, which was
      far more soldierly in character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gerard! Merle!&rdquo; added Hulot, &ldquo;call in your men, form them into a
      battalion, take the rear, fire upon those dogs, and let&rsquo;s make an end of
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The order was difficult to obey, for the young chief, hearing Hulot&rsquo;s
      voice, cried out: &ldquo;By Saint Anne of Auray, don&rsquo;t let them get away! Spread
      out, spread out, my lads!&rdquo; and each of the two wings of the Blues was
      followed by Chouans who were fully as obstinate and far superior in
      numbers. The Republicans were surrounded on all sides by the Goatskins
      uttering their savage cries, which were more like howls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongues, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Beau-Pied; &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t hear ourselves
      be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This jest revived the courage of the Blues. Instead of fighting only at
      one point, the Republicans spread themselves to three different points on
      the table-land of La Pelerine, and the rattle of musketry woke all the
      echoes of the valleys, hitherto so peaceful beneath it. Victory might have
      remained doubtful for many hours, or the fight might have come to an end
      for want of combatants, for Blues and Chouans were equally brave and
      obstinate. Each side was growing more and more incensed, when the sound of
      a drum in the distance told that the body of men must be crossing the
      valley of Couesnon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the National Guard of Fougeres!&rdquo; cried Gudin, in a loud voice;
      &ldquo;my man has brought them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words reached the ears of the young leader of the Chouans and his
      ferocious aide-de-camp, and the royalists made a hasty retrograde
      movement, checked, however, by a brutal shout from Marche-a-Terre. After
      two or three orders given by the leader in a low voice, and transmitted by
      Marche-a-Terre in the Breton dialect, the Chouans made good their retreat
      with a cleverness which disconcerted the Republicans and even the
      commandant. At the first word of command they formed in line, presenting a
      good front, behind which the wounded retreated, and the others reloaded
      their guns. Then, suddenly, with the agility already shown by
      Marche-a-Terre, the wounded were taken over the brow of the eminence to
      the right of the road, while half the others followed them slowly to
      occupy the summit, where nothing could be seen of them by the Blues but
      their bold heads. There they made a rampart of the trees and pointed the
      muzzles of their guns on the Republicans, who were rapidly reformed under
      reiterated orders from Hulot and turned to face the remainder of the
      Chouans, who were still before them in the road. The latter retreated
      slowly, disputing the ground and wheeling so as to bring themselves under
      cover of their comrades&rsquo; fire. When they reached the broad ditch which
      bordered the road, they scaled the high bank on the other side, braving
      the fire of the Republicans, which was sufficiently well-directed to fill
      the ditch with dead bodies. The Chouans already on the summit answered
      with a fire that was no less deadly. At that moment the National Guard of
      Fougeres reached the scene of action at a quick step, and its mere
      presence put an end to the affair. The Guard and some of the soldiers
      crossed the road and began to enter the woods, but the commandant called
      to them in his martial voice, &ldquo;Do you want to be annihilated over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victory remained to the Republicans, though not without heavy loss.
      All the battered old hats were hung on the points of the bayonets and the
      muskets held aloft, while the soldiers shouted with one voice: &ldquo;Vive la
      Republique!&rdquo; Even the wounded, sitting by the roadside, shared in the
      general enthusiasm; and Hulot, pressing Gerard&rsquo;s hand, exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! those are what I call <i>veterans</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merle was directed to bury the dead in a ravine; while another party of
      men attended to the removal of the wounded. The carts and horses of the
      neighborhood were put into requisition, and the suffering men were
      carefully laid on the clothing of the dead. Before the little column
      started, the National Guard of Fougeres turned over to Hulot a Chouan,
      dangerously wounded, whom they had captured at the foot of the slope up
      which his comrades had escaped, and where he had fallen from weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for your help, citizens,&rdquo; said the commandant. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder! if
      it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, we should have had a pretty bad quarter of an
      hour. Take care of yourselves; the war has begun. Adieu, friends.&rdquo; Then,
      turning to the prisoner, he asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of your general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Marche-a-Terre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Gars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does the Gars come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this question the prisoner, whose face was convulsed with suffering,
      made no reply; he took out his beads and began to say his prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gars is no doubt that young <i>ci-devant</i> with the black cravat,&mdash;sent
      by the tyrant and his allies Pitt and Coburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that words the Chouan raised his head proudly and said: &ldquo;Sent by God
      and the king!&rdquo; He uttered the words with an energy which exhausted his
      strength. The commandant saw the difficulty of questioning a dying man,
      whose countenance expressed his gloomy fanaticism, and he turned away his
      head with a frown. Two soldiers, friends of those whom Marche-a-Terre had
      so brutally killed with the butt of his whip, stepped back a pace or two,
      took aim at the Chouan, whose fixed eyes did not blink at the muzzles of
      their guns, fired at short range, and brought him down. When they
      approached the dead body to strip it, the dying man found strength to cry
      out loudly, &ldquo;Vive le roi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you canting hypocrite,&rdquo; cried Clef-des-Coeurs; &ldquo;go and make
      your report to that Virgin of yours. Didn&rsquo;t he shout in our faces, &lsquo;Vive
      le roi!&rsquo; when we thought him cooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are his papers, commandant,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; cried Clef-des-Coeurs. &ldquo;Come, all of you, and see this minion of
      the good God with colors on his stomach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot and several soldiers came round the body, now entirely naked, and
      saw upon its breast a blue tattooing in the form of a swollen heart. It
      was the sign of initiation into the brotherhood of the Sacred Heart. Above
      this sign were the words, &ldquo;Marie Lambrequin,&rdquo; no doubt the man&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that, Clef-des-Coeurs,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied; &ldquo;it would take you a
      hundred years to find out what that accoutrement is good for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I know about the Pope&rsquo;s uniform?&rdquo; replied Clef-des-Coeurs,
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You worthless bog-trotter, you&rsquo;ll never learn anything,&rdquo; retorted
      Beau-Pied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that they&rsquo;ve promised that poor fool that he
      shall live again, and he has painted his gizzard in order to find
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this sally&mdash;which was not without some foundation&mdash;even Hulot
      joined in the general hilarity. At this moment Merle returned, and the
      burial of the dead being completed and the wounded placed more or less
      comfortably in two carts, the rest of the late escort formed into two
      lines round the improvised ambulances, and descended the slope of the
      mountain towards Maine, where the beautiful valley of La Pelerine, a rival
      to that of Couesnon lay before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulot with his two officers followed the troop slowly, hoping to get
      safely to Ernee where the wounded could be cared for. The fight we have
      just described, which was almost forgotten in the midst of the greater
      events which were soon to occur, was called by the name of the mountain on
      which it took place. It obtained some notice at the West, where the
      inhabitants, observant of this second uprising, noticed on this occasion a
      great change in the manner in which the Chouans now made war. In earlier
      days they would never have attacked so large a detachment. According to
      Hulot the young royalist whom he had seen was undoubtedly the Gars, the
      new general sent to France by the princes, who, following the example of
      the other royalist chiefs, concealed his real name and title under one of
      those pseudonyms called &ldquo;noms de guerre.&rdquo; This circumstance made the
      commandant quite as uneasy after his melancholy victory as he had been
      before it while expecting the attack. He turned several times to consider
      the table-land of La Pelerine which he was leaving behind him, across
      which he could still hear faintly at intervals the drums of the National
      Guard descending into the valley of Couesnon at the same time that the
      Blues were descending into that of La Pelerine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can either of you,&rdquo; he said to his two friends, &ldquo;guess the motives of
      that attack of the Chouans? To them, fighting is a matter of business, and
      I can&rsquo;t see what they expected to gain by this attack. They have lost at
      least a hundred men, and we&rdquo;&mdash;he added, screwing up his right cheek
      and winking by way of a smile, &ldquo;have lost only sixty. God&rsquo;s thunder! I
      don&rsquo;t understand that sort of speculation. The scoundrels needn&rsquo;t have
      attacked us; we might just as well have been allowed to pass like letters
      through the post&mdash;No, I don&rsquo;t see what good it has done them to
      bullet-hole our men,&rdquo; he added, with a sad shake of his head toward the
      carts. &ldquo;Perhaps they only intended to say good-day to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they carried off our recruits, commander,&rdquo; said Merle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The recruits could have skipped like frogs into the woods at any time,
      and we should never have gone after them, especially if those fellows had
      fired a single volley,&rdquo; returned Hulot. &ldquo;No, no, there&rsquo;s something behind
      all this.&rdquo; Again he turned and looked at La Pelerine. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; he cried;
      &ldquo;see there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though they were now at a long distance from the fatal plateau, they could
      easily distinguish Marche-a-Terre and several Chouans who were again
      occupying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double-quick, march!&rdquo; cried Hulot to his men, &ldquo;open your compasses and
      trot the steeds faster than that! Are your legs frozen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words drove the little troop into a rapid motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery, and it&rsquo;s hard to make out,&rdquo; continued Hulot, speaking
      to his friends. &ldquo;God grant it isn&rsquo;t explained by muskets at Ernee. I&rsquo;m
      very much afraid that we shall find the road to Mayenne cut off by the
      king&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The strategical problem which troubled the commandant was causing quite as
      much uneasiness to the persons whom he had just seen on the summit of Mont
      Pelerine. As soon as the drums of the National Guard were out of hearing
      and Marche-a-Terre had seen the Blues at the foot of the declivity, he
      gave the owl&rsquo;s cry joyously, and the Chouans reappeared, but their numbers
      were less. Some were no doubt busy in taking care of the wounded in the
      little village of La Pelerine, situated on the side of the mountain which
      looks toward the valley of Couesnon. Two or three chiefs of what were
      called the &ldquo;Chasseurs du Roi&rdquo; clustered about Marche-a-Terre. A few feet
      apart sat the young noble called The Gars, on a granite rock, absorbed in
      thoughts excited by the difficulties of his enterprise, which now began to
      show themselves. Marche-a-Terre screened his forehead with his hand from
      the rays of the sun, and looked gloomily at the road by which the Blues
      were crossing the valley of La Pelerine. His small black eyes could see
      what was happening on the hill-slopes on the other side of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Blues will intercept the messenger,&rdquo; said the angry voice of one of
      the leaders who stood near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Saint Anne of Auray!&rdquo; exclaimed another. &ldquo;Why did you make us fight?
      Was it to save your own skin from the Blues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre darted a venomous look at his questioner and struck the
      ground with his heavy carbine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I your leader?&rdquo; he asked. Then after a pause he added, pointing to the
      remains of Hulot&rsquo;s detachment, &ldquo;If you had all fought as I did, not one of
      those Blues would have escaped, and the coach could have got here safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d never have thought of escorting it or holding it back if we had
      let them go by without a fight. No, you wanted to save your precious skin
      and get out of their hands&mdash;He has bled us for the sake of his own
      snout,&rdquo; continued the orator, &ldquo;and made us lose twenty thousand francs in
      good coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snout yourself!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre, retreating three steps and aiming
      at his aggressor. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that you hate the Blues, but you love the
      gold. Die without confession and be damned, for you haven&rsquo;t taken the
      sacrament for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This insult so incensed the Chouan that he turned pale and a low growl
      came from his chest as he aimed in turn at Marche-a-Terre. The young chief
      sprang between them and struck their weapons from their hands with the
      barrel of his own carbine; then he demanded an explanation of the dispute,
      for the conversation had been carried on in the Breton dialect, an idiom
      with which he was not familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, as he ended his account of the
      quarrel, &ldquo;it is all the more unreasonable in them to find fault with me
      because I have left Pille-Miche behind me; he&rsquo;ll know how to save the
      coach for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, angrily, &ldquo;are you waiting here, all of
      you, to pillage that coach?&mdash;a parcel of cowards who couldn&rsquo;t win a
      victory in the first fight to which I led you! But why should you win if
      that&rsquo;s your object? The defenders of God and the king are thieves, are
      they? By Saint Anne of Auray! I&rsquo;d have you know, we are making war against
      the Republic, and not robbing travellers. Those who are guilty in future
      of such shameful actions shall not receive absolution, nor any of the
      favors reserved for the faithful servants of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that the
      authority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young man, on
      whom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was thinking of the
      best means of maintaining the dignity of his command, when the trot of a
      horse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned in the direction from
      which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting astride of a little Breton
      horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as she saw the young leader, so
      as to reach the group of Chouans as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she said, looking first at the Chouans and then at
      their chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you believe it, madame? they are waiting to rob the diligence from
      Mayenne to Fougeres when we have just had a skirmish, in order to release
      the conscripts of Fougeres, which has cost us a great many men without
      defeating the Blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s the harm of that?&rdquo; asked the young lady, to whom the
      natural shrewdness of a woman explained the whole scene. &ldquo;You have lost
      men, but there&rsquo;s no lack of others; the coach is bringing gold, and
      there&rsquo;s always a lack of that. We bury men, who go to heaven, and we take
      money, which goes into the pockets of heroes. I don&rsquo;t see the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans approved of her speech by unanimous smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see nothing in all that to make you blush?&rdquo; said the young man, in
      a low voice. &ldquo;Are you in such need of money that you must pillage on the
      high-road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so eager for it, marquis, that I should put my heart in pawn if it
      were not already captured,&rdquo; she said, smiling coquettishly. &ldquo;But where did
      you get the strange idea that you could manage Chouans without letting
      them rob a few Blues here and there? Don&rsquo;t you know the saying, &lsquo;Thieving
      as an owl&rsquo;?&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a Chouan. Besides,&rdquo; she said, raising her
      voice to be heard by the men, &ldquo;it is just; haven&rsquo;t the Blues seized the
      property of the Church, and our own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another murmur, very different from the growl with which the Chouans had
      answered their leader, greeted these words. The young man&rsquo;s face grew
      darker; he took the young lady aside and said in the annoyed tone of a
      well-bred man, &ldquo;Will those gentlemen be at La Vivetiere on the appointed
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;all of them, the Claimant, Grand-Jacques, and perhaps
      Ferdinand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then allow me to return there. I cannot sanction such robbery. Yes,
      madame, I call it robbery. There may be honor in being robbed, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she said, interrupting him, &ldquo;then I shall have your share of
      the booty, and I am much obliged to you for giving it up to me; the extra
      sum will be extremely useful, for my mother has delayed sending me money,
      so that I am almost destitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; cried the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, but the lady ran after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you stay with me?&rdquo; she said, giving him the look,
      half-despotic, half-caressing, with which women who have a right to a
      man&rsquo;s respect let him know their wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to pillage that coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pillage? what a word!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me explain to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain nothing,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand and kissing it with the
      superficial gallantry of a courtier. &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he added after a
      short pause: &ldquo;if I were to stay here while they capture that diligence our
      people would kill me, for I should certainly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not kill them,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;for they would bind your hands, with
      all the respect that is due to your rank; then, having levied the
      necessary contribution for their equipment, subsistence, and munitions
      from our enemies, they would unbind you and obey you blindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wish me to command such men under such circumstances? If my life
      is necessary to the cause which I defend allow me at any rate to save the
      honor of my position. If I withdraw now I can ignore this base act. I will
      return, in order to escort you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he rapidly disappeared. The young lady listened to his receding
      steps with evident displeasure. When the sound on the dried leaves ceased,
      she stood for a moment as if confounded, then she hastily returned to the
      Chouans. With a gesture of contempt she said to Marche-a-Terre, who helped
      her to dismount, &ldquo;That young man wants to make regular war on the
      Republic! Ah, well! he&rsquo;ll get over that in a few days. How he treated me!&rdquo;
       she thought, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself on the rock where the marquis had been sitting, and
      silently awaited the arrival of the coach. It was one of the phenomena of
      the times, and not the least of them, that this young and noble lady
      should be flung by violent partisanship into the struggle of monarchies
      against the spirit of the age, and be driven by the strength of her
      feelings into actions of which it may almost be said she was not
      conscious. In this she resembled others of her time who were led away by
      an enthusiasm which was often productive of noble deeds. Like her, many
      women played heroic or blameworthy parts in the fierce struggle. The
      royalist cause had no emissaries so devoted and so active as these women;
      but none of the heroines on that side paid for mistaken devotion or for
      actions forbidden to their sex, with a greater expiation than did this
      lady when, seated on that wayside rock, she was forced to admire the young
      leader&rsquo;s noble disdain and loyalty to principle. Insensibly she dropped
      into reverie. Bitter memories made her long for the innocence of her early
      years, and regret that she had escaped being a victim of the Revolution
      whose victorious march could no longer be arrested by feeble hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach, which, as we now see, had much to do with the attack of the
      Chouans, had started from the little town of Ernee a few moments before
      the skirmishing began. Nothing pictures a region so well as the state of
      its social material. From this point of view the coach deserves a mention.
      The Revolution itself was powerless to destroy it; in fact, it still rolls
      to this present day. When Turgot bought up the privileges of a company,
      obtained under Louis XIV., for the exclusive right of transporting
      travellers from one part of the kingdom to another, and instituted the
      lines of coaches called the &ldquo;turgotines,&rdquo; all the old vehicles of the
      former company flocked into the provinces. One of these shabby coaches was
      now plying between Mayenne and Fougeres. A few objectors called it the
      &ldquo;turgotine,&rdquo; partly to mimic Paris and partly to deride a minister who
      attempted innovations. This turgotine was a wretched cabriolet on two high
      wheels, in the depths of which two persons, if rather fat, could with
      difficulty have stowed themselves. The narrow quarters of this rickety
      machine not admitting of any crowding, and the box which formed the seat
      being kept exclusively for the postal service, the travellers who had any
      baggage were forced to keep it between their legs, already tortured by
      being squeezed into a sort of little box in shape like a bellows. The
      original color of coach and running-gear was an insoluble enigma. Two
      leather curtains, very difficult to adjust in spite of their long service,
      were supposed to protect the occupants from cold and rain. The driver,
      perched on a plank seat like those of the worst Parisian &ldquo;coucous,&rdquo; shared
      in the conversation by reason of his position between his victims, biped
      and quadruped. The equipage presented various fantastic resemblances to
      decrepit old men who have gone through a goodly number of catarrhs and
      apoplexies and whom death respects; it moaned as it rolled, and squeaked
      spasmodically. Like a traveller overtaken by sleep, it rocked alternately
      forward and back, as though it tried to resist the violent action of two
      little Breton horses which dragged it along a road which was more than
      rough. This monument of a past era contained three travellers, who, on
      leaving Ernee, where they had changed horses, continued a conversation
      begun with the driver before reaching the little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think the Chouans are hereabouts?&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;The
      Ernee people tell me that Commandant Hulot has not yet started from
      Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho, friend driver!&rdquo; said the youngest of the travellers, &ldquo;you risk
      nothing but your own carcass! If you had a thousand francs about you, as I
      have, and were known to be a good patriot, you wouldn&rsquo;t take it so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pretty free with your tongue, any way,&rdquo; said the driver, shaking
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count your lambs, and the wolf will eat them,&rdquo; remarked another of the
      travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, who was dressed in black, seemed to be about forty years old,
      and was, probably, the rector of some parish in the neighborhood. His chin
      rested on a double fold of flesh, and his florid complexion indicated a
      priest. Though short and fat, he displayed some agility when required to
      get in or out of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are both Chouans!&rdquo; cried the man of the thousand francs,
      whose ample goatskin, covering trousers of good cloth and a clean
      waistcoat, bespoke a rich farmer. &ldquo;By the soul of Saint Robespierre! I
      swear you shall be roughly handled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his gray eyes from the driver to his fellow-travellers and
      showed them a pistol in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bretons are not afraid of that,&rdquo; said the rector, disdainfully. &ldquo;Besides,
      do we look like men who want your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every time the word &ldquo;money&rdquo; was mentioned the driver was silent, and the
      rector had wit enough to doubt whether the patriot had any at all, and to
      suspect that the driver was carrying a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you well laden, Coupiau?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Monsieur Gudin,&rdquo; replied the coachman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m carrying next to
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest watched the faces of the patriot and Coupiau as the latter made
      this answer, and both were imperturbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for you,&rdquo; remarked the patriot. &ldquo;I can now take
      measures to save my property in case of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such despotic assumption nettled Coupiau, who answered gruffly: &ldquo;I am the
      master of my own carriage, and so long as I drive you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a patriot, or are you a Chouan?&rdquo; said the other, sharply
      interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; replied Coupiau. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a postilion, and,
      what is more, a Breton,&mdash;consequently, I fear neither Blues nor
      nobles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble thieves!&rdquo; cried the patriot, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They only take back what was stolen from them,&rdquo; said the rector,
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other in the whites of their eyes, if we may
      use a phrase so colloquial. Sitting back in the vehicle was a third
      traveller who took no part in the discussion, and preserved a deep
      silence. The driver and the patriot and even Gudin paid no attention to
      this mute individual; he was, in truth, one of those uncomfortable,
      unsocial travellers who are found sometimes in a stage-coach, like a
      patient calf that is being carried, bound, to the nearest market. Such
      travellers begin by filling their legal space, and end by sleeping,
      without the smallest respect for their fellow-beings, on a neighbor&rsquo;s
      shoulder. The patriot, Gudin, and the driver had let him alone, thinking
      him asleep, after discovering that it was useless to talk to a man whose
      stolid face betrayed an existence spent in measuring yards of linen, and
      an intellect employed in selling them at a good percentage above cost.
      This fat little man, doubled-up in his corner, opened his porcelain-blue
      eyes every now and then, and looked at each speaker with a sort of terror.
      He appeared to be afraid of his fellow-travellers and to care very little
      about the Chouans. When he looked at the driver, however, they seemed to
      be a pair of free-masons. Just then the first volley of musketry was heard
      on La Pelerine. Coupiau, frightened, stopped the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; said the priest, as if he had some means of judging, &ldquo;it is a
      serious engagement; there are many men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble for us, Monsieur Gudin,&rdquo; cried Coupiau, &ldquo;is to know which
      side will win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faces of all became unanimously anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us put up the coach at that inn which I see over there,&rdquo; said the
      patriot; &ldquo;we can hide it till we know the result of the fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advice seemed so good that Coupiau followed it. The patriot helped him
      to conceal the coach behind a wood-pile; the abbe seized the occasion to
      pull Coupiau aside and say to him, in a low voice: &ldquo;Has he really any
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Monsieur Gudin, if it gets into the pockets of your Reverence, they
      won&rsquo;t be weighed down with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Blues marched by, after the encounter on La Pelerine, they were
      in such haste to reach Ernee that they passed the little inn without
      halting. At the sound of their hasty march, Gudin and the innkeeper,
      stirred by curiosity, went to the gate of the courtyard to watch them.
      Suddenly, the fat ecclesiastic rushed to a soldier who was lagging in the
      rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudin!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you wrong-headed fellow, have you joined the Blues? My
      lad, you are surely not in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; answered the corporal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn to defend France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy boy! you&rsquo;ll lose your soul,&rdquo; said the uncle, trying to rouse his
      nephew to the religious sentiments which are so powerful in the Breton
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;if the king had placed himself at the head
      of his armies, I don&rsquo;t say but what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! who is talking to you about the king? Does your republic give
      abbeys? No, it has upset everything. How do you expect to get on in life?
      Stay with us; sooner or later we shall triumph and you&rsquo;ll be counsellor to
      some parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parliaments!&rdquo; said young Gudin, in a mocking tone. &ldquo;Good-bye, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have a penny at my death,&rdquo; cried his uncle, in a rage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      disinherit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, uncle,&rdquo; said the Republican, as they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fumes of the cider which the patriot copiously bestowed on Coupiau
      during the passage of the little troop had somewhat dimmed the driver&rsquo;s
      perceptions, but he roused himself joyously when the innkeeper, having
      questioned the soldiers, came back to the inn and announced that the Blues
      were victorious. He at once brought out the coach and before long it was
      wending its way across the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Blues reached an acclivity on the road from which the plateau of
      La Pelerine could again be seen in the distance, Hulot turned round to
      discover if the Chouans were still occupying it, and the sun, glinting on
      the muzzles of the guns, showed them to him, each like a dazzling spot.
      Giving a last glance to the valley of La Pelerine before turning into that
      of Ernee, he thought he saw Coupiau&rsquo;s vehicle on the road he had just
      traversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the Mayenne coach?&rdquo; he said to his two officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at the venerable turgotine, and easily recognized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Hulot, &ldquo;how did we fail to meet it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merle and Gerard looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another enigma!&rdquo; cried the commandant. &ldquo;But I begin to see the meaning of
      it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Marche-a-Terre, who also knew the turgotine, called his
      comrades&rsquo; attention to it, and the general shout of joy which they sent up
      roused the young lady from her reflections. She advanced a little distance
      and saw the coach, which was beginning the ascent of La Pelerine with
      fatal rapidity. The luckless vehicle soon reached the plateau. The
      Chouans, who had meantime hidden themselves, swooped on their prey with
      hungry celerity. The silent traveller slipped to the floor of the
      carriage, bundling himself up into the semblance of a bale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried Coupiau from his wooden perch, pointing to the man in
      the goatskin; &ldquo;you must have scented this patriot who has lots of gold in
      his pouch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans greeted these words with roars of laughter, crying out:
      &ldquo;Pille-Miche! hey, Pille-Miche! Pille-Miche!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid the laughter, to which Pille-Miche responded like an echo, Coupiau
      came down from his seat quite crestfallen. When the famous Cibot,
      otherwise called Pille-Miche, helped his neighbor to get out of the coach,
      a respectful murmur was heard among the Chouans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Abbe Gudin!&rdquo; cried several voices. At this respected name every
      hat was off, and the men knelt down before the priest as they asked his
      blessing, which he gave solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pille-Miche here could trick Saint Peter and steal the keys of Paradise,&rdquo;
       said the rector, slapping that worthy on the shoulder. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been
      for him, the Blues would have intercepted us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, noticing the lady, the abbe went to speak to her apart.
      Marche-a-Terre, who had meantime briskly opened the boot of the cabriolet,
      held up to his comrades, with savage joy, a bag, the shape of which
      betrayed its contents to be rolls of coin. It did not take long to divide
      the booty. Each Chouan received his share, so carefully apportioned that
      the division was made without the slightest dispute. Then Marche-a-Terre
      went to the lady and the priest, and offered them each about six thousand
      francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I conscientiously accept this money, Monsieur Gudin?&rdquo; said the lady,
      feeling a need of justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, madame? In former days the Church approved of the confiscation
      of the property of Protestants, and there&rsquo;s far more reason for
      confiscating that of these revolutionists, who deny God, destroy chapels,
      and persecute religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbe then joined example to precept by accepting, without the
      slightest scruple, the novel sort of tithe which Marche-a-Terre offered to
      him. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I can now devote all I possess to the service
      of God and the king; for my nephew has joined the Blues, and I disinherit
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coupiau was bemoaning himself and declaring that he was ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join us,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, &ldquo;and you shall have your share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll say I let the coach be robbed on purpose if I return without
      signs of violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; exclaimed Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a signal and a shower of bullets riddled the turgotine. At this
      unexpected volley the old vehicle gave forth such a lamentable cry that
      the Chouans, superstitious by nature, recoiled in terror; but
      Marche-a-Terre caught sight of the pallid face of the silent traveller
      rising from the floor of the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got another fowl in your coop,&rdquo; he said in a low voice to Coupiau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver; &ldquo;but I make it a condition of my joining you that
      I be allowed to take that worthy man safe and sound to Fougeres. I&rsquo;m
      pledged to it in the name of Saint Anne of Auray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; replied Coupiau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone!&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, shoving Pille-Miche with his elbow;
      &ldquo;he has vowed by Saint Anne of Auray, and he must keep his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, addressing Coupiau; &ldquo;but mind you don&rsquo;t go
      down the mountain too fast; we shall overtake you,&mdash;a good reason
      why; I want to see the cut of your traveller, and give him his passport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the gallop of a horse coming rapidly up the slopes of La
      Pelerine was heard, and the young chief presently reappeared. The lady
      hastened to conceal the bag of plunder which she held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can keep that money without any scruple,&rdquo; said the young man,
      touching the arm which the lady had put behind her. &ldquo;Here is a letter for
      you which I have just found among mine which were waiting for me at La
      Vivetiere; it is from your mother.&rdquo; Then, looking at the Chouans who were
      disappearing into the woods, and at the turgotine which was now on its way
      to the valley of Couesnon, he added: &ldquo;After all my haste I see I am too
      late. God grant I am deceived in my suspicions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my poor mother&rsquo;s money!&rdquo; cried the lady, after opening her letter,
      the first lines of which drew forth her exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smothered laugh came from the woods, and the young man himself could not
      help smiling as he saw the lady holding in her hand the bag containing her
      share in the pillage of her own money. She herself began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, marquis, God be praised! this time, at least, you can&rsquo;t blame
      me,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Levity in everything! even your remorse!&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored and looked at the marquis with so genuine a contrition that he
      was softened. The abbe politely returned to her, with an equivocal manner,
      the sum he had received; then he followed the young leader who took the
      by-way through which he had come. Before following them the lady made a
      sign to Marche-a-Terre, who came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance towards Mortagne,&rdquo; she said to him in a low voice. &ldquo;I know that
      the Blues are constantly sending large sums of money in coin to Alencon to
      pay for their supplies of war. If I allow you and your comrades to keep
      what you captured to-day it is only on condition that you repay it later.
      But be careful that the Gars knows nothing of the object of the
      expedition; he would certainly oppose it; in case of ill-luck, I will
      pacify him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the marquis, after she had rejoined him and had mounted his
      horse <i>en croupe</i>, giving her own to the abbe, &ldquo;my friends in Paris
      write me to be very careful of what we do; the Republic, they say, is
      preparing to fight us with spies and treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad plan,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;they have clever ideas, those
      fellows. I could take part in that sort of war and find foes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it!&rdquo; cried the marquis. &ldquo;Pichegru advises me to be cautious
      and watchful in my friendships and relations of every kind. The Republic
      does me the honor to think me more dangerous than all the Vendeans put
      together, and counts on certain of my weaknesses to lay hands upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you will not distrust me?&rdquo; she said, striking his heart with the
      hand by which she held to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a traitor, madame?&rdquo; he said, bending towards her his forehead,
      which she kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the abbe, referring to the news, &ldquo;Fouche&rsquo;s police
      will be more dangerous for us than their battalions of recruits and
      counter-Chouans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, true enough, father,&rdquo; replied the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;Fouche means to send women against you, does
      he? I shall be ready for them,&rdquo; she added in a deeper tone of voice and
      after a slight pause.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At a distance of three or four gunshots from the plateau, now abandoned, a
      little scene was taking place which was not uncommon in those days on the
      high-roads. After leaving the little village of La Pelerine, Pille-Miche
      and Marche-a-Terre again stopped the turgotine at a dip in the road.
      Coupiau got off his seat after making a faint resistance. The silent
      traveller, extracted from his hiding place by the two Chouans, found
      himself on his knees in a furze bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Marche-a-Terre in a threatening voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller kept silence until Pille-Miche put the question again and
      enforced it with the butt end of his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Jacques Pinaud,&rdquo; he replied, with a glance at Coupiau; &ldquo;a poor
      linen-draper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coupiau made a sign in the negative, not considering it an infraction of
      his promise to Saint Anne. The sign enlightened Pille-Miche, who took aim
      at the luckless traveller, while Marche-a-Terre laid before him
      categorically a terrible ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too fat to be poor. If you make me ask you your name again,
      here&rsquo;s my friend Pille-Miche, who will obtain the gratitude and good-will
      of your heirs in a second. Who are you?&rdquo; he added, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am d&rsquo;Orgemont, of Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; cried the two Chouans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell your name, Monsieur d&rsquo;Orgemont,&rdquo; said Coupiau. &ldquo;The Holy
      Virgin is my witness that I did my best to protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inasmuch as you are Monsieur d&rsquo;Orgemont, of Fougeres,&rdquo; said
      Marche-a-Terre, with an air of ironical respect, &ldquo;we shall let you go in
      peace. Only, as you are neither a good Chouan nor a true Blue (thought it
      was you who bought the property of the Abbey de Juvigny), you will pay us
      three hundred crowns of six francs each for your ransom. Neutrality is
      worth that, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred crowns of six francs each!&rdquo; chorussed the luckless banker,
      Pille-Miche, and Coupiau, in three different tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my good friend,&rdquo; continued d&rsquo;Orgemont, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a ruined man. The last
      forced loan of that devilish Republic for a hundred millions sucked me
      dry, taxed as I was already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did your Republic get out of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand crowns, my dear man,&rdquo; replied the banker, with a piteous air,
      hoping for a reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your Republic gets forced loans out of you for such big sums as that
      you must see that you would do better with us; our government would cost
      you less. Three hundred crowns, do you call that dear for your skin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I to get them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of your strong-box,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche; &ldquo;and mind that the money is
      forthcoming, or we&rsquo;ll singe you still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to pay it to you?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Orgemont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your country-house at Fougeres is not far from Gibarry&rsquo;s farm where my
      cousin Galope-Chopine, otherwise called Cibot, lives. You can pay the
      money to him,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not business-like,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Orgemont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care for that?&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre. &ldquo;But mind you remember
      that if that money is not paid to Galope-Chopine within two weeks we shall
      pay you a little visit which will cure your gout. As for you, Coupiau,&rdquo;
       added Marche-a-Terre, &ldquo;your name in future is to be Mene-a-Bien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the two Chouans departed. The traveller returned to the
      vehicle, which, thanks to Coupiau&rsquo;s whip, now made rapid progress to
      Fougeres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d only been armed,&rdquo; said Coupiau, &ldquo;we might have made some
      defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Orgemont, pointing to his heavy shoes. &ldquo;I have ten
      thousand francs in those soles; do you think I would be such a fool as to
      fight with that sum about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mene-a-Bien scratched his ear and looked behind him, but his new comrades
      were out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulot and his command stopped at Ernee long enough to place the wounded in
      the hospital of the little town, and then, without further hindrance, they
      reached Mayenne. There the commandant cleared up his doubts as to the
      action of the Chouans, for on the following day the news of the pillage of
      the turgotine was received.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the government despatched to Mayenne so strong a force of
      &ldquo;patriotic conscripts,&rdquo; that Hulot was able to fill the ranks of his
      brigade. Disquieting rumors began to circulate about the insurrection. A
      rising had taken place at all the points where, during the late war, the
      Chouans and Bretons had made their chief centres of insurrection. The
      little town of Saint-James, between Pontorson and Fougeres was occupied by
      them, apparently for the purpose of making it for the time being a
      headquarters of operations and supplies. From there they were able to
      communicate with Normandy and the Morbihan without risk. Their subaltern
      leaders roamed the three provinces, roused all the partisans of monarchy,
      and gave consistence and unity to their plans. These proceedings coincided
      with what was going on in La Vendee, where the same intrigues, under the
      influence of four famous leaders (the Abbe Vernal, the Comte de Fontaine,
      De Chatillon, and Suzannet), were agitating the country. The Chevalier de
      Valois, the Marquis d&rsquo;Esgrignon, and the Troisvilles were, it was said,
      corresponding with these leaders in the department of the Orne. The chief
      of the great plan of operations which was thus developing slowly but in
      formidable proportions was really &ldquo;the Gars,&rdquo;&mdash;a name given by the
      Chouans to the Marquis de Montauran on his arrival from England. The
      information sent to Hulot by the War department proved correct in all
      particulars. The marquis gained after a time sufficient ascendancy over
      the Chouans to make them understand the true object of the war, and to
      persuade them that the excesses of which they were guilty brought disgrace
      upon the cause they had adopted. The daring nature, the nerve, coolness,
      and capacity of this young nobleman awakened the hopes of all the enemies
      of the Republic, and suited so thoroughly the grave and even solemn
      enthusiasm of those regions that even the least zealous partisans of the
      king did their part in preparing a decisive blow in behalf of the defeated
      monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulot received no answer to the questions and the frequent reports which
      he addressed to the government in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the news of the almost magical return of General Bonaparte and the
      events of the 18th Brumaire were soon current in the air. The military
      commanders of the West understood then the silence of the ministers.
      Nevertheless, they were only the more impatient to be released from the
      responsibility that weighed upon them; and they were in every way desirous
      of knowing what measures the new government was likely to take. When it
      was known to these soldiers that General Bonaparte was appointed First
      Consul of the Republic their joy was great; they saw, for the first time,
      one of their own profession called to the management of the nation.
      France, which had made an idol of this young hero, quivered with hope. The
      vigor and energy of the nation revived. Paris, weary of its long gloom,
      gave itself up to fetes and pleasures of which it had been so long
      deprived. The first acts of the Consulate did not diminish any hopes, and
      Liberty felt no alarm. The First Consul issued a proclamation to the
      inhabitants of the West. The eloquent allocutions addressed to the masses
      which Bonaparte had, as it were, invented, produced effects in those days
      of patriotism and miracle that were absolutely startling. His voice echoed
      through the world like the voice of a prophet, for none of his
      proclamations had, as yet, been belied by defeat.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  INHABITANTS:

  An impious war again inflames the West.

  The makers of these troubles are traitors sold to the English, or
  brigands who seek in civil war opportunity and license for
  misdeeds.

  To such men the government owes no forbearance, nor any
  declaration of its principles.

  But there are citizens, dear to France, who have been misled by
  their wiles. It is so such that truth and light are due.

  Unjust laws have been promulgated and executed; arbitrary acts
  have threatened the safety of citizens and the liberty of
  consciences; mistaken entries on the list of <i>emigres</i> imperil
  citizens; the great principles of social order have been violated.

  The Consuls declare that liberty of worship having been guaranteed
  by the Constitution, the law of 11 Prairial, year III., which
  gives the use of edifices built for religious worship to all
  citizens, shall be executed.

  The government will pardon; it will be merciful to repentance; its
  mercy will be complete and absolute; but it will punish whosoever,
  after this declaration, shall dare to resist the national
  sovereignty.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hulot, after the public reading of this Consular manifesto,
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that paternal enough? But you&rsquo;ll see that not a single royalist
      brigand will be changed by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant was right. The proclamation merely served to strengthen
      each side in their own convictions. A few days later Hulot and his
      colleagues received reinforcements. The new minister of war notified them
      that General Brune was appointed to command the troops in the west of
      France. Hulot, whose experience was known to the government, had
      provisional control in the departments of the Orne and Mayenne. An unusual
      activity began to show itself in the government offices. Circulars from
      the minister of war and the minister of police gave notice that vigorous
      measures entrusted to the military commanders would be taken to stifle the
      insurrection at its birth. But the Chouans and the Vendeans had profited
      by the inaction of the Directory to rouse the whole region and virtually
      take possession of it. A new Consular proclamation was therefore issued.
      This time, it was the general speaking to his troops:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  SOLDIERS:

  There are none but brigands, <i>emigres</i>, and hirelings of England
  now remaining in the West.

  The army is composed of more than fifty thousand brave men. Let me
  speedily hear from them that the rebel chiefs have ceased to live.
  Glory is won by toil alone; if it could be had by living in
  barracks in a town, all would have it.

  Soldiers, whatever be the rank you hold in the army, the gratitude
  of the nation awaits you. To be worthy of it, you must brave the
  inclemencies of weather, ice, snow, and the excessive coldness of
  the nights; you must surprise your enemies at daybreak, and
  exterminate those wretches, the disgrace of France.

  Make a short and sure campaign; be inexorable to those brigands,
  and maintain strict discipline.

  National Guards, join the strength of your arms to that of the
  line.

  If you know among you any men who fraternize with the brigands,
  arrest them. Let them find no refuge; pursue them; if traitors
  dare to harbor and defend them, let them perish together.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man!&rdquo; cried Hulot. &ldquo;It is just as it was in the army of Italy&mdash;he
      rings in the mass, and he says it himself. Don&rsquo;t you call that talking,
      hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he speaks by himself and in his own name,&rdquo; said Gerard, who
      began to feel alarmed at the possible results of the 18th Brumaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where&rsquo;s the harm, since he&rsquo;s a soldier?&rdquo; said Merle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of soldiers were clustered at a little distance before the same
      proclamation posted on a wall. As none of them could read, they gazed at
      it, some with a careless eye, others with curiosity, while two or three
      hunted about for a citizen who looked learned enough to read it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you tell us, Clef-des-Coeurs, what that rag of a paper says,&rdquo; cried
      Beau-Pied, in a saucy tone to his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy to guess,&rdquo; replied Clef-des-Coeurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the other men clustered round the pair, who were always
      ready to play their parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; continued Clef-des-Coeurs, pointing to a coarse woodcut
      which headed the proclamation and represented a pair of compasses,&mdash;which
      had lately superseded the level of 1793. &ldquo;It means that the troops&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      us&mdash;are to march firm; don&rsquo;t you see the compasses are open, both
      legs apart?&mdash;that&rsquo;s an emblem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such much for your learning, my lad; it isn&rsquo;t an emblem&mdash;it&rsquo;s called
      a problem. I&rsquo;ve served in the artillery,&rdquo; continued Beau-Pied, &ldquo;and
      problems were meat and drink to my officers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s an emblem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you bet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your German pipe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your leave, adjutant, isn&rsquo;t that thing an emblem, and not a problem?&rdquo;
       said Clef-des-Coeurs, following Gerard, who was thoughtfully walking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is both,&rdquo; he replied, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adjutant was making fun of you,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied. &ldquo;That paper means
      that our general in Italy is promoted Consul, which is a fine grade, and
      we are to get shoes and overcoats.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II. ONE OF FOUCHE&rsquo;S IDEAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning towards the end of Brumaire just as Hulot was exercising his
      brigade, now by order of his superiors wholly concentrated at Mayenne, a
      courier arrived from Alencon with despatches, at the reading of which his
      face betrayed extreme annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, then!&rdquo; he cried in an angry tone, sticking the papers into the
      crown of his hat. &ldquo;Two companies will march with me towards Mortagne. The
      Chouans are there. You will accompany me,&rdquo; he said to Merle and Gerard.
      &ldquo;May be I created a nobleman if I can understand one word of that
      despatch. Perhaps I&rsquo;m a fool! well, anyhow, forward, march! there&rsquo;s no
      time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant, by your leave,&rdquo; said Merle, kicking the cover of the
      ministerial despatch with the toe of his boot, &ldquo;what is there so
      exasperating in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder! nothing at all&mdash;except that we are fooled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the commandant gave vent to this military oath (an object it must be
      said of Republican atheistical remonstrance) it gave warning of a storm;
      the diverse intonations of the words were degrees of a thermometer by
      which the brigade could judge of the patience of its commander; the old
      soldier&rsquo;s frankness of nature had made this knowledge so easy that the
      veriest little drummer-boy knew his Hulot by heart, simply by observing
      the variations of the grimace with which the commander screwed up his
      cheek and snapped his eyes and vented his oath. On this occasion the tone
      of smothered rage with which he uttered the words made his two friends
      silent and circumspect. Even the pits of the small-pox which dented that
      veteran face seemed deeper, and the skin itself browner than usual. His
      broad queue, braided at the edges, had fallen upon one of his epaulettes
      as he replaced his three-cornered hat, and he flung it back with such fury
      that the ends became untied. However, as he stood stock-still, his hands
      clenched, his arms crossed tightly over his breast, his mustache
      bristling, Gerard ventured to ask him presently: &ldquo;Are we to start at
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if the men have ammunition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoulder arms! Left wheel, forward, march!&rdquo; cried Gerard, at a sign from
      the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drum-corps marched at the head of the two companies designated by
      Gerard. At the first roll of the drums the commandant, who still stood
      plunged in thought, seemed to rouse himself, and he left the town
      accompanied by his two officers, to whom he said not a word. Merle and
      Gerard looked at each other silently as if to ask, &ldquo;How long is he going
      to keep us in suspense?&rdquo; and, as they marched, they cautiously kept an
      observing eye on their leader, who continued to vent rambling words
      between his teeth. Several times these vague phrases sounded like oaths in
      the ears of his soldiers, but not one of them dared to utter a word; for
      they all, when occasion demanded, maintained the stern discipline to which
      the veterans who had served under Bonaparte in Italy were accustomed. The
      greater part of them had belonged, like Hulot, to the famous battalions
      which capitulated at Mayenne under a promise not to serve again on the
      frontier, and the army called them &ldquo;Les Mayencais.&rdquo; It would be difficult
      to find leaders and men who more thoroughly understood each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn of the day after their departure Hulot and his troop were on the
      high-road to Alencon, about three miles from that town towards Mortagne,
      at a part of the road which leads through pastures watered by the Sarthe.
      A picturesque vista of these meadows lay to the left, while the woodlands
      on the right which flank the road and join the great forest of
      Menil-Broust, serve as a foil to the delightful aspect of the
      river-scenery. The narrow causeway is bordered on each side by ditches the
      soil of which, being constantly thrown out upon the fields, has formed
      high banks covered with furze,&mdash;the name given throughout the West to
      this prickly gorse. This shrub, which spreads itself in thorny masses,
      makes excellent fodder in winter for horses and cattle; but as long as it
      was not cut the Chouans hid themselves behind its breastwork of dull
      green. These banks bristling with gorse, signifying to travellers their
      approach to Brittany, made this part of the road at the period of which we
      write as dangerous as it was beautiful; it was these dangers which
      compelled the hasty departure of Hulot and his soldiers, and it was here
      that he at last let out the secret of his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now on his return, escorting an old mail-coach drawn by
      post-horses, which the weariness of his soldiers, after their forced
      march, was compelling to advance at a snail&rsquo;s pace. The company of Blues
      from the garrison at Mortagne, who had escorted the rickety vehicle to the
      limits of their district, where Hulot and his men had met them, could be
      seen in the distance, on their way back to their quarters, like so many
      black specks. One of Hulot&rsquo;s companies was in the rear, the other in
      advance of the carriage. The commandant, who was marching with Merle and
      Gerard between the advance guard and the carriage, suddenly growled out:
      &ldquo;Ten thousand thunders! would you believe that the general detached us
      from Mayenne to escort two petticoats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, commandant,&rdquo; remarked Gerard, &ldquo;when we came up just now and took
      charge I observed that you bowed to them not ungraciously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s the infamy of it. Those dandies in Paris ordered the greatest
      attention paid to their damned females. How dare they dishonor good and
      brave patriots by trailing us after petticoats? As for me, I march
      straight, and I don&rsquo;t choose to have to do with other people&rsquo;s zigzags.
      When I saw Danton taking mistresses, and Barras too, I said to them:
      &lsquo;Citizens, when the Republic called you to govern, it was not that you
      might authorize the vices of the old regime!&rsquo; You may tell me that women&mdash;oh
      yes! we must have women, that&rsquo;s all right. Good soldiers of course must
      have women, and good women; but in times of danger, no! Besides, where
      would be the good of sweeping away the old abuses if patriots bring them
      back again? Look at the First Consul, there&rsquo;s a man! no women for him;
      always about his business. I&rsquo;d bet my left mustache that he doesn&rsquo;t know
      the fool&rsquo;s errand we&rsquo;ve been sent on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, commandant,&rdquo; said Merle, laughing, &ldquo;I have seen the tip-end of the
      nose of the young lady, and I&rsquo;ll declare the whole world needn&rsquo;t be
      ashamed to feel an itch, as I do, to revolve round that carriage and get
      up a bit of a conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Merle,&rdquo; said Gerard; &ldquo;the veiled beauties have a man
      accompanying them who seems wily enough to catch you in a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? that <i>incroyable</i> whose little eyes are ferretting from one
      side of the road to the other, as if he saw Chouans? The fellow seems to
      have no legs; the moment his horse is hidden by the carriage, he looks
      like a duck with its head sticking out of a pate. If that booby can hinder
      me from kissing the pretty linnet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Duck&rsquo;! &lsquo;linnet&rsquo;! oh, my poor Merle, you have taken wings indeed! But
      don&rsquo;t trust the duck. His green eyes are as treacherous as the eyes of a
      snake, and as sly as those of a woman who forgives her husband. I distrust
      the Chouans much less than I do those lawyers whose faces are like bottles
      of lemonade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; cried Merle, gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it&mdash;with the commandant&rsquo;s
      permission. That woman has eyes like stars, and it&rsquo;s worth playing any
      stakes to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught, poor fellow!&rdquo; said Gerard to the commandant; &ldquo;he is beginning to
      talk nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot made a face, shrugged his shoulders, and said: &ldquo;Before he swallows
      the soup, I advise him to smell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Merle,&rdquo; said Gerard, &ldquo;judging by his friend&rsquo;s lagging step that he
      meant to let the carriage overtake him. Isn&rsquo;t he a happy fellow? He is the
      only man I know who can laugh over the death of a comrade without being
      thought unfeeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the true French soldier,&rdquo; said Hulot, in a grave tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at him pulling his epaulets back to his shoulders, to show he
      is a captain,&rdquo; cried Gerard, laughing,&mdash;&ldquo;as if his rank mattered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coach toward which the officer was pivoting did, in fact, contain two
      women, one of whom seemed to be the servant of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such women always run in couples,&rdquo; said Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lean and sharp-looking little man ambled his horse sometimes before,
      sometimes behind the carriage; but, though he was evidently accompanying
      these privileged women, no one had yet seen him speak to them. This
      silence, a proof either of respect or contempt, as the case might be; the
      quantity of baggage belonging to the lady, whom the commandant sneeringly
      called &ldquo;the princess&rdquo;; everything, even to the clothes of her attendant
      squire, stirred Hulot&rsquo;s bile. The dress of the unknown man was a good
      specimen of the fashions of the day then being caricatured as
      &ldquo;incroyable,&rdquo;&mdash;unbelievable, unless seen. Imagine a person trussed up
      in a coat, the front of which was so short that five or six inches of the
      waistcoat came below it, while the skirts were so long that they hung down
      behind like the tail of a cod,&mdash;the term then used to describe them.
      An enormous cravat was wound about his neck in so many folds that the
      little head which protruded from that muslin labyrinth certainly did
      justify Captain Merle&rsquo;s comparison. The stranger also wore tight-fitting
      trousers and Suwaroff boots. A huge blue-and-white cameo pinned his shirt;
      two watch-chains hung from his belt; his hair, worn in ringlets on each
      side of his face, concealed nearly the whole forehead; and, for a last
      adornment, the collar of his shirt and that of his coat came so high that
      his head seemed enveloped like a bunch of flowers in a horn of paper. Add
      to these queer accessories, which were combined in utter want of harmony,
      the burlesque contradictions in color of yellow trousers, scarlet
      waistcoat, cinnamon coat, and a correct idea will be gained of the supreme
      good taste which all dandies blindly obeyed in the first years of the
      Consulate. This costume, utterly uncouth, seemed to have been invented as
      a final test of grace, and to show that there was nothing too ridiculous
      for fashion to consecrate. The rider seemed to be about thirty years old,
      but he was really twenty-two; perhaps he owed this appearance of age to
      debauchery, possibly to the perils of the period. In spite of his
      preposterous dress, he had a certain elegance of manner which proved him
      to be a man of some breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the captain had dropped back close to the carriage, the dandy seemed
      to fathom his design, and favored it by checking his horse. Merle, who had
      flung him a sardonic glance, encountered one of those impenetrable faces,
      trained by the vicissitudes of the Revolution to hide all, even the most
      insignificant, emotion. The moment the curved end of the old triangular
      hat and the captain&rsquo;s epaulets were seen by the occupants of the carriage,
      a voice of angelic sweetness said: &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;officier, will you have the
      kindness to tell us at what part of the road we now are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is some inexpressible charm in the question of an unknown traveller,
      if a woman,&mdash;a world of adventure is in every word; but if the woman
      asks for assistance or information, proving her weakness or ignorance of
      certain things, every man is inclined to construct some impossible tale
      which shall lead to his happiness. The words, &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;officier,&rdquo; and
      the polite tone of the question stirred the captain&rsquo;s heart in a manner
      hitherto unknown to him. He tried to examine the lady, but was cruelly
      disappointed, for a jealous veil concealed her features; he could barely
      see her eyes, which shone through the gauze like onyx gleaming in the
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are now three miles from Alencon, madame,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alencon! already!&rdquo; and the lady threw herself, or, rather, she gently
      leaned back in the carriage, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alencon?&rdquo; said the other woman, apparently waking up; &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll see it
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught sight of the captain and was silent. Merle, disappointed in his
      hope of seeing the face of the beautiful incognita, began to examine that
      of her companion. She was a girl about twenty-six years of age, fair, with
      a pretty figure and the sort of complexion, fresh and white and well-fed,
      which characterizes the women of Valognes, Bayeux, and the environs of
      Alencon. Her blue eyes showed no great intelligence, but a certain
      firmness mingled with tender feeling. She wore a gown of some common
      woollen stuff. The fashion of her hair, done up closely under a Norman
      cap, without any pretension, gave a charming simplicity to her face. Her
      attitude, without, of course, having any of the conventional nobility of
      society, was not without the natural dignity of a modest young girl, who
      can look back upon her past life without a single cause for repentance.
      Merle knew her at a glance for one of those wild flowers which are
      sometimes taken from their native fields to Parisian hot-houses, where so
      many blasting rays are concentrated, without ever losing the purity of
      their color or their rustic simplicity. The naive attitude of the girl and
      her modest glance showed Merle very plainly that she did not wish a
      listener. In fact, no sooner had he withdrawn than the two women began a
      conversation in so low a tone that only a murmur of it reached his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came away in such a hurry,&rdquo; said the country-girl, &ldquo;that you hardly
      took time to dress. A pretty-looking sight you are now! If we are going
      beyond Alencon, you must really make your toilet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! Francine!&rdquo; cried the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the third time you have tried to make me tell you the reasons for
      this journey and where we are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I said one single word which deserves that reproach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve noticed your manoeuvring. Simple and truthful as you are, you
      have learned a little cunning from me. You are beginning to hold
      questioning in horror; and right enough, too, for of all the known ways of
      getting at a secret, questions are, to my mind, the silliest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Francine, &ldquo;since nothing escapes you, you must admit, Marie,
      that your conduct would excite the curiosity of a saint. Yesterday without
      a penny, to-day your hands are full of gold; at Mortagne they give you the
      mail-coach which was pillaged and the driver killed, with government
      troops to protect you, and you are followed by a man whom I regard as your
      evil genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Corentin?&rdquo; said the young lady, accenting the words by two
      inflections of her voice expressive of contempt, a sentiment which
      appeared in the gesture with which she waved her hand towards the rider.
      &ldquo;Listen, Francine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you remember Patriot, the monkey I
      taught to imitate Danton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, were you afraid of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was chained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Corentin is muzzled, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We used to play with Patriot by the hour,&rdquo; said Francine,&mdash;&ldquo;I know
      that; but he always ended by serving us some bad trick.&rdquo; So saying,
      Francine threw herself hastily back close to her mistress, whose hands she
      caught and kissed in a coaxing way; saying in a tone of deep affection:
      &ldquo;You know what I mean, Marie, but you will not answer me. How can you,
      after all that sadness which did so grieve me&mdash;oh, indeed it grieved
      me!&mdash;how can you, in twenty-four hours, change about and become so
      gay? you, who talked of suicide! Why have you changed? I have a right to
      ask these questions of your soul&mdash;it is mine, my claim to it is
      before that of others, for you will never be better loved than you are by
      me. Speak, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Francine, don&rsquo;t you see all around you the secret of my good
      spirits? Look at the yellowing tufts of those distant tree-tops; not one
      is like another. As we look at them from this distance don&rsquo;t they seem
      like an old bit of tapestry? See the hedges from behind which the Chouans
      may spring upon us at any moment. When I look at that gorse I fancy I can
      see the muzzles of their guns. Every time the road is shady under the
      trees I fancy I shall hear firing, and then my heart beats and a new
      sensation comes over me. It is neither the shuddering of fear nor an
      emotion of pleasure; no, it is better than either, it is the stirring of
      everything within me&mdash;it is life! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be gay when a
      little excitement is dropped into my monotonous existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are telling me nothing, cruel girl! Holy Virgin!&rdquo; added Francine,
      raising her eyes in distress to heaven; &ldquo;to whom will she confess herself
      if she denies the truth to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine,&rdquo; said the lady, in a grave tone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain to you my
      present enterprise; it is horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do wrong when you know it to be wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it? I catch myself thinking as if I were fifty, and acting
      as if I were still fifteen. You have always been my better self, my poor
      Francine, but in this affair I must stifle conscience. And,&rdquo; she added
      after a pause, &ldquo;I cannot. Therefore, how can you expect me to take a
      confessor as stern as you?&rdquo; and she patted the girl&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I ever blame your actions?&rdquo; cried Francine. &ldquo;Evil is so mixed
      with good in your nature. Yes, Saint Anne of Auray, to whom I pray to save
      you, will absolve you for all you do. And, Marie, am I not here beside
      you, without so much as knowing where you go?&rdquo; and she kissed her hands
      with effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied Marie, &ldquo;you may yet desert me, if your conscience&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried Francine, with a hurt expression. &ldquo;But
      surely you will tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said the young lady, in a resolute voice. &ldquo;Only&mdash;and I
      wish you to know it&mdash;I hate this enterprise even more than I hate him
      whose gilded tongue induced me to undertake it. I will be rank and own to
      you that I would never have yielded to their wishes if I had not foreseen,
      in this ignoble farce, a mingling of love and danger which tempted me. I
      cannot bear to leave this empty world without at least attempting to
      gather the flowers that it owes me,&mdash;whether I perish in the attempt
      or not. But remember, for the honor of my memory, that had I ever been a
      happy woman, the sight of their great knife, ready to fall upon my neck,
      would not have driven me to accept a part in this tragedy&mdash;for it is
      a tragedy. But now,&rdquo; she said, with a gesture of disgust, &ldquo;if it were
      countermanded, I should instantly fling myself into the Sarthe. It would
      not be destroying life, for I have never lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Saint Anne of Auray, forgive her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you so afraid of? You know very well that the dull round of
      domestic life gives no opportunity for my passions. That would be bad in
      most women, I admit; but my soul is made of a higher sensibility and can
      bear great tests. I might have been, perhaps, a gentle being like you.
      Why, why have I risen above or sunk beneath the level of my sex? Ah! the
      wife of Bonaparte is a happy woman! Yes, I shall die young, for I am gay,
      as you say,&mdash;gay at this pleasure-party, where there is blood to
      drink, as that poor Danton used to say. There, there, forget what I am
      saying; it is the woman of fifty who speaks. Thank God! the girl of
      fifteen is still within me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young country-girl shuddered. She alone knew the fiery, impetuous
      nature of her mistress. She alone was initiated into the mysteries of a
      soul rich with enthusiasm, into the secret emotions of a being who, up to
      this time, had seen life pass her like a shadow she could not grasp, eager
      as she was to do so. After sowing broadcast with full hands and harvesting
      nothing, this woman was still virgin in soul, but irritated by a multitude
      of baffled desires. Weary of a struggle without an adversary, she had
      reached in her despair to the point of preferring good to evil, if it came
      in the form of enjoyment; evil to good, if it offered her some poetic
      emotion; misery to mediocrity, as something nobler and higher; the gloomy
      and mysterious future of present death to a life without hopes or even
      without sufferings. Never in any heart was so much powder heaped ready for
      the spark, never were so many riches for love to feed on; no daughter of
      Eve was ever moulded, with a greater mixture of gold in her clay.
      Francine, like an angel of earth, watched over this being whose
      perfections she adored, believing that she obeyed a celestial mandate in
      striving to bring that spirit back among the choir of seraphim whence it
      was banished for the sin of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the clock-tower of Alencon,&rdquo; said the horseman, riding up to the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; replied the young lady, in a cold tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, turning away with all the signs of servile
      submission, in spite of his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go faster,&rdquo; said the lady to the postilion. &ldquo;There is no longer any
      danger; go at a fast trot, or even a gallop, if you can; we are almost
      into Alencon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage passed the commandant, she called out to him, in a sweet
      voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will meet at the inn, commandant. Come and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; growled the commandant. &ldquo;&lsquo;The inn&rsquo;! &lsquo;Come and see me&rsquo;! Is that
      how you speak to an officer in command of the army?&rdquo; and he shook his fist
      at the carriage, which was now rolling rapidly along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be vexed, commandant, she has got your rank as general up her
      sleeve,&rdquo; said Corentin, laughing, as he endeavored to put his horse into a
      gallop to overtake the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let myself be fooled by any such folks as they,&rdquo; said Hulot to
      his two friends, in a growling tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather throw my general&rsquo;s coat
      into that ditch than earn it out of a bed. What are these birds after?
      Have you any idea, either of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Merle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea that that&rsquo;s the handsomest women I ever
      saw! I think you&rsquo;re reading the riddle all wrong. Perhaps she&rsquo;s the wife
      of the First Consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! the First Consul&rsquo;s wife is old, and this woman is young,&rdquo; said
      Hulot. &ldquo;Besides, the order I received from the minister gives her name as
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil. She is a <i>ci-devant</i>. Don&rsquo;t I know &lsquo;em?
      They all plied one trade before the Revolution, and any man could make
      himself a major, or a general in double-quick time; all he had to do was
      to say &lsquo;Dear heart&rsquo; to them now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While each soldier opened his compasses, as the commandant was wont to
      say, the miserable vehicle which was then used as the mail-coach drew up
      before the inn of the Trois Maures, in the middle of the main street of
      Alencon. The sound of the wheels brought the landlord to the door. No one
      in Alencon could have expected the arrival of the mail-coach at the Trois
      Maures, for the murderous attack upon the coach at Mortagne was already
      known, and so many people followed it along the street that the two women,
      anxious to escape the curiosity of the crowd, ran quickly into the
      kitchen, which forms the inevitable antechamber to all Western inns. The
      landlord was about to follow them, after examining the coach, when the
      postilion caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attention, citizen Brutus,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an escort of the Blues
      behind us; but it is I who bring you these female citizens; they&rsquo;ll pay
      like <i>ci-devant</i> princesses, therefore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, we&rsquo;ll drink a glass of wine together presently, my lad,&rdquo; said
      the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      After glancing about the kitchen, blackened with smoke, and noticing a
      table bloody from raw meat, Mademoiselle de Verneuil flew into the next
      room with the celerity of a bird; for she shuddered at the sight and smell
      of the place, and feared the inquisitive eyes of a dirty <i>chef</i>, and
      a fat little woman who examined her attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do, wife?&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Who the devil could have
      supposed we would have so many on our hands in these days? Before I serve
      her a decent breakfast that woman will get impatient. Stop, an idea!
      evidently she is a person of quality. I&rsquo;ll propose to put her with the one
      we have upstairs. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the landlord went to look for the new arrival he found only Francine,
      to whom he spoke in a low voice, taking her to the farther end of the
      kitchen, so as not to be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the ladies wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be served in private, as I have no
      doubt they wish to do, I have a very nice breakfast all ready for a lady
      and her son, and I dare say wouldn&rsquo;t mind sharing it with you; they are
      persons of condition,&rdquo; he added, mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly said the words before he felt a tap on his back from the
      handle of a whip. He turned hastily and saw behind him a short, thick-set
      man, who had noiselessly entered from a side room,&mdash;an apparition
      which seemed to terrify the hostess, the cook, and the scullion. The
      landlord turned pale when he saw the intruder, who shook back the hair
      which concealed his forehead and eyes, raised himself on the points of his
      toes to reach the other&rsquo;s ears, and said to him in a whisper: &ldquo;You know
      the cost of an imprudence or a betrayal, and the color of the money we pay
      it in. We are generous in that coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added a gesture which was like a horrible commentary to his words.
      Though the rotundity of the landlord prevented Francine from seeing the
      stranger, who stood behind him, she caught certain words of his
      threatening speech, and was thunderstruck at hearing the hoarse tones of a
      Breton voice. She sprang towards the man, but he, seeming to move with the
      agility of a wild animal, had already darted through a side door which
      opened on the courtyard. Utterly amazed, she ran to the window. Through
      its panes, yellowed with smoke, she caught sight of the stranger as he was
      about to enter the stable. Before doing so, however, he turned a pair of
      black eyes to the upper story of the inn, and thence to the mail-coach in
      the yard, as if to call some friend&rsquo;s attention to the vehicle. In spite
      of his muffling goatskin and thanks to this movement which allowed her to
      see his face, Francine recognized the Chouan, Marche-a-Terre, with his
      heavy whip; she saw him, indistinctly, in the obscurity of the stable,
      fling himself down on a pile of straw, in a position which enabled him to
      keep an eye on all that happened at the inn. Marche-a-Terre curled himself
      up in such a way that the cleverest spy, at any distance far or near,
      might have taken him for one of those huge dogs that drag the hand-carts,
      lying asleep with his muzzle on his paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of the Chouan proved to Francine that he had not recognized
      her. Under the hazardous circumstances which she felt her mistress to be
      in, she scarcely knew whether to regret or to rejoice in this
      unconsciousness. But the mysterious connection between the landlord&rsquo;s
      offer (not uncommon among innkeepers, who can thus kill two birds with one
      stone), and the Chouan&rsquo;s threats, piqued her curiosity. She left the dirty
      window from which she could see the formless heap which she knew to be
      Marche-a-Terre, and returned to the landlord, who was still standing in
      the attitude of a man who feels he has made a blunder, and does not know
      how to get out of it. The Chouan&rsquo;s gesture had petrified the poor fellow.
      No one in the West was ignorant of the cruel refinements of torture with
      which the &ldquo;Chasseurs du Roi&rdquo; punished those who were even suspected of
      indiscretion; the landlord felt their knives already at his throat. The
      cook looked with a shudder at the iron stove on which they often &ldquo;warmed&rdquo;
       (&ldquo;chauffaient&rdquo;) the feet of those they suspected. The fat landlady held a
      knife in one hand and a half-peeled potato in the other, and gazed at her
      husband with a stupefied air. Even the scullion puzzled himself to know
      the reason of their speechless terror. Francine&rsquo;s curiosity was naturally
      excited by this silent scene, the principal actor of which was visible to
      all, though departed. The girl was gratified at the evident power of the
      Chouan, and though by nature too simple and humble for the tricks of a
      lady&rsquo;s maid, she was also far too anxious to penetrate the mystery not to
      profit by her advantages on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle accepts your proposal,&rdquo; she said to the landlord, who jumped
      as if suddenly awakened by her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proposal?&rdquo; he asked with genuine surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proposal?&rdquo; asked Corentin, entering the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proposal?&rdquo; asked Mademoiselle de Verneuil, returning to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proposal?&rdquo; asked a fourth individual on the lower step of the
      staircase, who now sprang lightly into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the breakfast with your persons of distinction,&rdquo; replied Francine,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distinction!&rdquo; said the ringing and ironical voice of the person who had
      just come down the stairway. &ldquo;My good fellow, that strikes me as a very
      poor inn joke; but if it&rsquo;s the company of this young female citizen that
      you want to give us, we should be fools to refuse it. In my mother&rsquo;s
      absence, I accept,&rdquo; he added, striking the astonished innkeeper on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charming heedlessness of youth disguised the haughty insolence of the
      words, which drew the attention of every one present to the new-comer. The
      landlord at once assumed the countenance of Pilate washing his hands of
      the blood of that just man; he slid back two steps to reach his wife&rsquo;s
      ear, and whispered, &ldquo;You are witness, if any harm comes of it, that it is
      not my fault. But, anyhow,&rdquo; he added, in a voice that was lower still, &ldquo;go
      and tell Monsieur Marche-a-Terre what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The traveller, who was a young man of medium height, wore a dark blue coat
      and high black gaiters coming above the knee and over the breeches, which
      were also of blue cloth. This simple uniform, without epaulets, was that
      of the pupils of the Ecole Polytechnique. Beneath this plain attire
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil could distinguish at a glance the elegant shape
      and nameless <i>something</i> that tells of natural nobility. The face of
      the young man, which was rather ordinary at first sight, soon attracted
      the eye by the conformation of certain features which revealed a soul
      capable of great things. A bronzed skin, curly fair hair, sparkling blue
      eyes, a delicate nose, motions full of ease, all disclosed a life guided
      by noble sentiments and trained to the habit of command. But the most
      characteristic signs of his nature were in the chin, which was dented like
      that of Bonaparte, and in the lower lip, which joined the upper one with a
      graceful curve, like that of an acanthus leaf on the capital of a
      Corinthian column. Nature had given to these two features of his face an
      irresistible charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man has singular distinction if he is really a republican,&rdquo;
       thought Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see all this at a glance, to brighten at the thought of pleasing, to
      bend her head softly and smile coquettishly and cast a soft look able to
      revive a heart that was dead to love, to veil her long black eyes with
      lids whose curving lashes made shadows on her cheeks, to choose the
      melodious tones of her voice and give a penetrating charm to the formal
      words, &ldquo;Monsieur, we are very much obliged to you,&rdquo;&mdash;all this
      charming by-play took less time than it has taken to describe it. After
      this, Mademoiselle de Verneuil, addressing the landlord, asked to be shown
      to a room, saw the staircase, and disappeared with Francine, leaving the
      stranger to discover whether her reply was intended as an acceptance or a
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that woman?&rdquo; asked the Polytechnique student, in an airy manner,
      of the landlord, who still stood motionless and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the female citizen Verneuil,&rdquo; replied Corentin, sharply, looking
      jealously at the questioner; &ldquo;a <i>ci-devant</i>; what is she to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, who was humming a revolutionary tune, turned his head
      haughtily towards Corentin. The two young men looked at each other for a
      moment like cocks about to fight, and the glance they exchanged gave birth
      to a hatred which lasted forever. The blue eye of the young soldier was as
      frank and honest as the green eye of the other man was false and
      malicious; the manners of the one had native grandeur, those of the other
      were insinuating; one was eager in his advance, the other deprecating; one
      commanded respect, the other sought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the citizen du Gua Saint-Cyr here?&rdquo; said a peasant, entering the
      kitchen at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of him?&rdquo; said the young man, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant made a low bow and gave him a letter, which the young cadet
      read and threw into the fire; then he nodded his head and the man
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you&rsquo;ve come from Paris, citizen?&rdquo; said Corentin, approaching the
      stranger with a certain ease of manner, and a pliant, affable air which
      seemed intolerable to the citizen du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have been graduated into some grade of the artillery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, citizen, into the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you are going to Brest?&rdquo; said Corentin, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young sailor turned lightly on the heels of his shoes without
      deigning to reply, and presently disappointed all the expectations which
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil had based on the charm of his appearance. He
      applied himself to ordering his breakfast with the eagerness of a boy,
      questioned the cook and the landlady about their receipts, wondered at
      provincial customs like a Parisian just out of his shell, made as many
      objections as any fine lady, and showed the more lack of mind and
      character because his face and manner had seemed to promise them. Corentin
      smiled with pity when he saw the face he made on tasting the best cider of
      Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heu!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;how can you swallow such stuff as that? It is meat and
      drink both. I don&rsquo;t wonder the Republic distrusts a province where they
      knock their harvest from trees with poles, and shoot travellers from the
      ditches. Pray don&rsquo;t put such medicine as that on the table; give us some
      good Bordeaux, white and red. And above all, do see if there is a good
      fire upstairs. These country-people are so backward in civilization!&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;there is but one Paris in the world; what a
      pity it is I can&rsquo;t transport it to sea! Heavens! spoil-sauce!&rdquo; he suddenly
      cried out to the cook; &ldquo;what makes you put vinegar in that fricassee when
      you have lemons? And, madame,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you gave me such coarse sheets I
      couldn&rsquo;t close my eyes all night.&rdquo; Then he began to twirl a huge cane,
      executing with a silly sort of care a variety of evolutions, the greater
      or less precision and agility of which were considered proofs of a young
      man&rsquo;s standing in the class of the Incroyables, so-called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is with such dandies as that,&rdquo; said Corentin to the landlord
      confidentially, watching his face, &ldquo;that the Republic expects to improve
      her navy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man,&rdquo; said the young sailor to the landlady, in a low voice, &ldquo;is a
      spy of Fouche&rsquo;s. He has &lsquo;police&rsquo; stamped on his face, and I&rsquo;ll swear that
      spot he has got on his chin is Paris mud. Well, set a thief to catch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a lady to whom the young sailor turned with every sign of
      outward respect, entered the kitchen of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mamma,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am glad you&rsquo;ve come. I have recruited some
      guests in your absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guests?&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;what folly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mademoiselle de Verneuil,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She perished on the scaffold after the affair of Savenay; she went to
      Mans to save her brother the Prince de Loudon,&rdquo; returned his mother,
      rather brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, madame,&rdquo; said Corentin, gently, emphasizing the word
      &ldquo;madame&rdquo;; &ldquo;there are two demoiselles de Verneuil; all great houses, as you
      know, have several branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady, surprised at this freedom, drew back a few steps to examine the
      speaker; she turned her black eyes upon him, full of the keen sagacity so
      natural to women, seeking apparently to discover in what interest he
      stepped forth to explain Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s birth. Corentin, on
      the other hand, who was studying the lady cautiously, denied her in his
      own mind the joys of motherhood and gave her those of love; he refused the
      possession of a son of twenty to a woman whose dazzling skin, and arched
      eyebrows, and lashes still unblemished, were the objects of his
      admiration, and whose abundant black hair, parted on the forehead into
      simple bands, bought out the youthfulness of an intelligent head. The
      slight lines of the brow, far from indicating age, revealed young
      passions. Though the piercing eyes were somewhat veiled, it was either
      from the fatigue of travelling or the too frequent expression of
      excitement. Corentin remarked that she was wrapped in a mantle of English
      material, and that the shape of her hat, foreign no doubt, did not belong
      to any of the styles called Greek, which ruled the Parisian fashions of
      the period. Corentin was one of those beings who are compelled by the bent
      of their natures to suspect evil rather than good, and he instantly
      doubted the citizenship of the two travellers. The lady, who, on her side,
      had made her observations on the person of Corentin with equal rapidity,
      turned to her son with a significant look which may be faithfully
      translated into the words: &ldquo;Who is this queer man? Is he of our stripe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this mute inquiry the youth replied by an attitude and a gesture which
      said: &ldquo;Faith! I can&rsquo;t tell; but I distrust him.&rdquo; Then, leaving his mother
      to fathom the mystery, he turned to the landlady and whispered: &ldquo;Try to
      find out who that fellow is; and whether he is really accompanying the
      young lady; and why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua, looking at Corentin, &ldquo;you are quite sure,
      citizen, that Mademoiselle de Verneuil is living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is living in flesh and blood as surely, <i>madame</i>, as the citizen
      du Gua Saint-Cyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This answer contained a sarcasm, the hidden meaning of which was known to
      none but the lady herself, and any one but herself would have been
      disconcerted by it. Her son looked fixedly at Corentin, who coolly pulled
      out his watch without appearing to notice the effect of his answer. The
      lady, uneasy and anxious to discover at once if the speech meant danger or
      was merely accidental, said to Corentin in a natural tone and manner; &ldquo;How
      little security there is on these roads. We were attacked by Chouans just
      beyond Mortagne. My son came very near being killed; he received two balls
      in his hat while protecting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, madame? were you in the mail-coach which those brigands
      robbed in spite of the escort,&mdash;the one we have just come by? You
      must know the vehicle well. They told me at Mortagne that the Chouans
      numbered a couple of thousands and that every one in the coach was killed,
      even the travellers. That&rsquo;s how history is written! Alas! madame,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;if they murder travellers so near to Paris you can fancy how
      unsafe the roads are in Brittany. I shall return to Paris and not risk
      myself any farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mademoiselle de Verneuil young and handsome?&rdquo; said the lady to the
      hostess, struck suddenly with an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the landlord interrupted the conversation, in which there was
      something of an angry element, by announcing that breakfast was ready. The
      young sailor offered his hand to his mother with an air of false
      familiarity that confirmed the suspicions of Corentin, to whom the youth
      remarked as he went up the stairway: &ldquo;Citizen, if you are travelling with
      the female citizen de Verneuil, and she accepts the landlord&rsquo;s proposal,
      you can come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the words were said in a careless tone and were not inviting,
      Corentin followed. The young man squeezed the lady&rsquo;s hand when they were
      five or six steps above him, and said, in a low voice: &ldquo;Now you see the
      dangers to which your imprudent enterprises, which have no glory in them,
      expose us. If we are discovered, how are we to escape? And what a
      contemptible role you force me to play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three reached a large room on the upper floor. Any one who has
      travelled in the West will know that the landlord had, on such an
      occasion, brought forth his best things to do honor to his guests, and
      prepared the meal with no ordinary luxury. The table was carefully laid.
      The warmth of a large fire took the dampness from the room. The linen,
      glass, and china were not too dingy. Corentin saw at once that the
      landlord had, as they say familiarly, cut himself into quarters to please
      the strangers. &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;these people are not what they
      pretend to be. That young man is clever. I took him for a fool, but I
      begin to believe him as shrewd as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, his mother, and Corentin awaited Mademoiselle de Verneuil,
      whom the landlord went to summon. But the handsome traveller did not come.
      The youth expected that she would make difficulties, and he left the room,
      humming the popular song, &ldquo;Guard the nation&rsquo;s safety,&rdquo; and went to that of
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, prompted by a keen desire to get the better of
      her scruples and take her back with him. Perhaps he wanted to solve the
      doubts which filled his mind; or else to exercise the power which all men
      like to think they wield over a pretty woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be hanged if he&rsquo;s a Republican,&rdquo; thought Corentin, as he saw him
      go. &ldquo;He moves his shoulders like a courtier. And if that&rsquo;s his mother,&rdquo; he
      added, mentally, looking at Madame du Gua, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Pope! They are
      Chouans; and I&rsquo;ll make sure of their quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door soon opened and the young man entered, holding the hand of
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, whom he led to the table with an air of
      self-conceit that was nevertheless courteous. The devil had not allowed
      that hour which had elapsed since the lady&rsquo;s arrival to be wasted. With
      Francine&rsquo;s assistance, Mademoiselle de Verneuil had armed herself with a
      travelling-dress more dangerous, perhaps, than any ball-room attire. Its
      simplicity had precisely that attraction which comes of the skill with
      which a woman, handsome enough to wear no ornaments, reduces her dress to
      the position of a secondary charm. She wore a green gown, elegantly cut,
      the jacket of which, braided and frogged, defined her figure in a manner
      that was hardly suitable for a young girl, allowing her supple waist and
      rounded bust and graceful motions to be fully seen. She entered the room
      smiling, with the natural amenity of women who can show a fine set of
      teeth, transparent as porcelain between rosy lips, and dimpling cheeks as
      fresh as those of childhood. Having removed the close hood which had
      almost concealed her head at her first meeting with the young sailor, she
      could now employ at her ease the various little artifices, apparently so
      artless, with which a woman shows off the beauties of her face and the
      grace of her head, and attracts admiration for them. A certain harmony
      between her manners and her dress made her seem so much younger than she
      was that Madame du Gua thought herself beyond the mark in supposing her
      over twenty. The coquetry of her apparel, evidently worn to please, was
      enough to inspire hope in the young man&rsquo;s breast; but Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil bowed to him, as she took her place, with a slight inclination of
      her head and without looking at him, putting him aside with an apparently
      light-hearted carelessness which disconcerted him. This coolness might
      have seemed to an observer neither caution nor coquetry, but indifference,
      natural or feigned. The candid expression on the young lady&rsquo;s face only
      made it the more impenetrable. She showed no consciousness of her charms,
      and was apparently gifted with the pretty manners that win all hearts, and
      had already duped the natural self-conceit of the young sailor. Thus
      baffled, the youth returned to his own seat with a sort of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil took Francine, who accompanied her, by the hand
      and said, in a caressing voice, turning to Madame de Gua: &ldquo;Madame, will
      you have the kindness to allow this young girl, who is more a friend than
      a servant to me, to sit with us? In these perilous times such devotion as
      hers can only be repaid by the heart; indeed, that is very nearly all that
      is left to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua replied to the last words, which were said half aside, with
      a rather unceremonious bow that betrayed her annoyance at the beauty of
      the new-comer. Then she said, in a low voice, to her son: &ldquo;&lsquo;Perilous
      times,&rsquo; &lsquo;devotion,&rsquo; &lsquo;madame,&rsquo; &lsquo;servant&rsquo;! that is not Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil; it is some girl sent here by Fouche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests were about to sit down when Mademoiselle de Verneuil noticed
      Corentin, who was still employed in a close scrutiny of the mother and
      son, who were showing some annoyance at his glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;you are no doubt too well bred to dog my
      steps. The Republic, when it sent my parents to the scaffold, did not
      magnanimously provide me with a guardian. Though you have, from extreme
      and chivalric gallantry accompanied me against my will to this place&rdquo; (she
      sighed), &ldquo;I am quite resolved not to allow your protecting care to become
      a burden to you. I am safe now, and you can leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a fixed and contemptuous look. Corentin understood her; he
      repressed the smile which almost curled the corners of his wily lips as he
      bowed to her respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citoyenne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is always an honor to obey you. Beauty is the
      only queen a Republican can serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s eyes, as she watched him depart, shone with
      such natural pleasure, she looked at Francine with a smile of intelligence
      which betrayed so much real satisfaction, that Madame du Gua, who grew
      prudent as she grew jealous, felt disposed to relinquish the suspicions
      which Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s great beauty had forced into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be Mademoiselle de Verneuil, after all,&rdquo; she whispered to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that escort?&rdquo; answered the young man, whose vexation at the young
      lady&rsquo;s indifference allowed him to be cautious. &ldquo;Is she a prisoner or an
      emissary, a friend or an enemy of the government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua made a sign as if to say that she would soon clear up the
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the departure of Corentin seemed to lessen the young man&rsquo;s
      distrust, and he began to cast on Mademoiselle de Verneuil certain looks
      which betrayed an immoderate admiration for women, rather than the
      respectful warmth of a dawning passion. The young girl grew more and more
      reserved, and gave all her attentions to Madame du Gua. The youth, angry
      with himself, tried, in his vexation, to turn the tables and seem
      indifferent. Mademoiselle de Verneuil appeared not to notice this
      manoeuvre; she continued to be simple without shyness and reserved without
      prudery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chance meeting of personages who, apparently, were not destined to
      become intimate, awakened no agreeable sympathy on either side. There was
      even a sort of vulgar embarrassment, an awkwardness which destroyed all
      the pleasure which Mademoiselle de Verneuil and the young sailor had begun
      by expecting. But women have such wonderful conventional tact, they are so
      intimately allied with each other, or they have such keen desires for
      emotion, that they always know how to break the ice on such occasions.
      Suddenly, as if the two beauties had the same thought, they began to tease
      their solitary knight in a playful way, and were soon vying with each
      other in the jesting attention which they paid to him; this unanimity of
      action left them free. At the end of half an hour, the two women, already
      secret enemies, were apparently the best of friends. The young man then
      discovered that he felt as angry with Mademoiselle de Verneuil for her
      friendliness and freedom as he had been with her reserve. In fact, he was
      so annoyed by it that he regretted, with a sort of dumb anger, having
      allowed her to breakfast with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, &ldquo;is your son always as gloomy as
      he is at this moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I ask myself what is the good of a fleeting
      happiness. The secret of my gloom is the evanescence of my pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a madrigal,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;which rings of the Court rather
      than the Polytechnique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son only expressed a very natural thought, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Madame
      du Gua, who had her own reasons for placating the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then laugh while you may,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, smiling at the
      young man. &ldquo;How do you look when you have really something to weep for, if
      what you are pleased to call a happiness makes you so dismal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This smile, accompanied by a provoking glance which destroyed the
      consistency of her reserve, revived the youth&rsquo;s feelings. But inspired by
      her nature, which often impels a woman to do either too much or too little
      under such circumstances, Mademoiselle de Verneuil, having covered the
      young man with that brilliant look full of love&rsquo;s promises, immediately
      withdrew from his answering expression into a cold and severe modesty,&mdash;a
      conventional performance by which a woman sometimes hides a true emotion.
      In a moment, a single moment, when each expected to see the eyelids of the
      other lowered, they had communicated to one another their real thoughts;
      but they veiled their glances as quickly as they had mingled them in that
      one flash which convulsed their hearts and enlightened them. Confused at
      having said so many things in a single glance, they dared no longer look
      at each other. Mademoiselle de Verneuil withdrew into cold politeness, and
      seemed to be impatient for the conclusion of the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you must have suffered very much in prison?&rdquo; said Madame du
      Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, madame, I sometimes think that I am still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your escort sent to protect you, mademoiselle, or to watch you? Are
      you still suspected by the Republic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle felt instinctively that Madame du Gua had no real interest in
      her, and the question alarmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I really do not know myself the exact nature of my
      relations to the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it fears you?&rdquo; said the young man, rather satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must respect her secrets,&rdquo; interposed Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame, the secrets of a young girl who knows nothing of life but its
      misfortunes are not interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; answered Madame du Gua, wishing to continue a conversation which
      might reveal to her all that she wanted to know, &ldquo;the First Consul seems
      to have excellent intentions. They say that he is going to remove the
      disabilities of the <i>emigres</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, madame,&rdquo; she replied, with rather too much eagerness, &ldquo;and
      if so, why do we rouse Brittany and La Vendee? Why bring civil war into
      France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This eager cry, in which she seemed to share her own reproach, made the
      young sailor quiver. He looked earnestly at her, but was unable to detect
      either hatred or love upon her face. Her beautiful skin, the delicacy of
      which was shown by the color beneath it, was impenetrable. A sudden and
      invincible curiosity attracted him to this strange creature, to whom he
      was already drawn by violent desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, after a pause, &ldquo;may I ask if you
      are going to Mayenne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the young man with a questioning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madame,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;as your son serves the Republic&rdquo; (she said
      the words with an apparently indifferent air, but she gave her companions
      one of those furtive glances the art of which belongs to women and
      diplomatists), &ldquo;you must fear the Chouans, and an escort is not to be
      despised. We are now almost travelling companions, and I hope you will
      come with me to Mayenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mother and son hesitated, and seemed to consult each other&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;that it is prudent in
      me to tell you that interests of the highest importance require our
      presence to-night in the neighborhood of Fougeres, and we have not yet
      been able to find a means of conveyance; but women are so naturally
      generous that I am ashamed not to confide in you. Nevertheless,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;before putting ourselves in your hands, I ought to know whether we shall
      get out of them safe and sound. In short, mademoiselle, are you the
      sovereign or the slave of your Republican escort? Pardon my frankness, but
      your position does not seem to me exactly natural&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live in times, monsieur, when nothing takes place naturally. You can
      accept my proposal without anxiety. Above all,&rdquo; she added, emphasizing her
      words, &ldquo;you need fear no treachery in an offer made by a woman who has no
      part in political hatreds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A journey thus made is not without danger,&rdquo; he said, with a look which
      gave significance to that commonplace remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you fear?&rdquo; she answered, smiling sarcastically. &ldquo;I see no
      peril for any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the woman who a moment ago shared my desires in her eyes?&rdquo;
       thought the young man. &ldquo;What a tone in her voice! she is laying a trap for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a shrill cry of an owl which appeared to have perched on
      the chimney top vibrated in the air like a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;Our journey
      together will not begin under favorable auspices. Do owls in these woods
      screech by daylight?&rdquo; she added, with a surprised gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said the young man, coolly. &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we
      may bring you ill-luck; you are thinking of that, I am sure. We had better
      not travel together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were said with a calmness and reserve which puzzled
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she replied, with truly aristocratic insolence, &ldquo;I am far from
      wishing to compel you. Pray let us keep the little liberty the Republic
      leaves us. If Madame were alone, I should insist&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy step of a soldier was heard in the passage, and the Commandant
      Hulot presently appeared in the doorway with a frowning brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, colonel,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, smiling and pointing
      to a chair beside her. &ldquo;Let us talk over the affairs of State. But what is
      the matter with you? Are there Chouans here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant stood speechless on catching sight of the young man, at
      whom he looked with peculiar attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, will you take some more hare? Mademoiselle, you are not eating,&rdquo;
       said the sailor to Francine, seeming busy with the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hulot&rsquo;s astonishment and Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s close observation
      had something too dangerously serious about them to be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, citizen?&rdquo; said the young man, abruptly; &ldquo;do you know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; replied the Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; I remember you at the School.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never went to any school,&rdquo; said the soldier, roughly. &ldquo;What school do
      you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Polytechnique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, those barracks where they expect to make soldiers in
      dormitories,&rdquo; said the veteran, whose aversion for officers trained in
      that nursery was insurmountable. &ldquo;To what arm do you belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Hulot, smiling vindictively, &ldquo;how many of your fellow-students
      are in the navy? Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; he added in a serious tone, &ldquo;that none
      but the artillery and the engineers graduate from there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was not disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An exception was made in my favor, on account of the name I bear,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;We are all naval men in our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of your family, citizen?&rdquo; asked Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Du Gua Saint-Cyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were not killed at Mortagne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came very near being killed,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua, quickly; &ldquo;my son
      received two balls in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your papers?&rdquo; asked Hulot, not listening to the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you propose to read them?&rdquo; said the young man, cavalierly; his blue
      eye, keen with suspicion, studied alternately the gloomy face of the
      commandant and that of Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stripling like you to pretend to fool me! Come, produce your papers, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La! la! citizen, I&rsquo;m not such a babe as I look to be. Why should I answer
      you? Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commander of this department,&rdquo; answered Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, of course, the matter is serious; I am taken with arms in my
      hand,&rdquo; and he held a glass full of Bordeaux to the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not thirsty,&rdquo; said Hulot. &ldquo;Come, your papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the rattle of arms and the tread of men was heard in the
      street. Hulot walked to the window and gave a satisfied look which made
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil tremble. That sign of interest on her part seemed
      to fire the young man, whose face had grown cold and haughty. After
      feeling in the pockets of his coat he drew forth an elegant portfolio and
      presented certain papers to the commandant, which the latter read slowly,
      comparing the description given in the passport with the face and figure
      of the young man before him. During this prolonged examination the owl&rsquo;s
      cry rose again; but this time there was no difficulty whatever in
      recognizing a human voice. The commandant at once returned the papers to
      the young man, with a scoffing look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like the music. You will
      come with me to headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you take him there?&rdquo; asked Mademoiselle de Verneuil, in a tone of
      some excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good lady,&rdquo; replied the commandant, with his usual grimace, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      none of your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Irritated by the tone and words of the old soldier, but still more at the
      sort of humiliation offered to her in presence of a man who was under the
      influence of her charms, Mademoiselle de Verneuil rose, abandoning the
      simple and modest manner she had hitherto adopted; her cheeks glowed and
      her eyes shone as she said in a quiet tone but with a trembling voice:
      &ldquo;Tell me, has this young man met all the requirements of the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;apparently,&rdquo; said Hulot ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I desire that you will leave him, <i>apparently</i>, alone,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Are you afraid he will escape you? You are to escort him with me to
      Mayenne; he will be in the coach with his mother. Make no objection; it is
      my will&mdash;Well, what?&rdquo; she added, noticing Hulot&rsquo;s grimace; &ldquo;do you
      suspect him still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing; balance his head with a little lead perhaps. He&rsquo;s a
      giddy-pate!&rdquo; said the commandant, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you joking, colonel?&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the commandant, nodding to the young man, &ldquo;make haste, let us
      be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this impertinence Mademoiselle de Verneuil became calm and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; she said to the young man, protecting him with a gesture that
      was full of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a beautiful head!&rdquo; said the youth to his mother, who frowned
      heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annoyance, and many other sentiments, aroused and struggled with, did
      certainly bring fresh beauties to the young woman&rsquo;s face. Francine, Madame
      du Gua, and her son had all risen from their seats. Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil hastily advanced and stood between them and the commandant, who
      smiled amusedly; then she rapidly unfastened the frogged fastenings of her
      jacket. Acting with that blindness which often seizes women when their
      self-love is threatened and they are anxious to show their power, as a
      child is impatient to play with a toy that has just been given to it, she
      took from her bosom a paper and presented it to Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; she said, with a sarcastic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned to the young man and gave him, in the excitement of her
      triumph, a look in which mischief was mingled with an expression of love.
      Their brows cleared, joy flushed each agitated face, and a thousand
      contradictory thoughts rose in their hearts. Madame du Gua noted in that
      one look far more of love than of pity in Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s
      intervention; and she was right. The handsome creature blushed beneath the
      other woman&rsquo;s gaze, understanding its meaning, and dropped her eyelids;
      then, as if aware of some threatening accusation, she raised her head
      proudly and defied all eyes. The commandant, petrified, returned the
      paper, countersigned by ministers, which enjoined all authorities to obey
      the orders of this mysterious lady. Having done so, he drew his sword,
      laid it across his knees, broke the blade, and flung away the pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you probably know what you are about; but a Republican has
      his own ideas, and his own dignity. I cannot serve where women command.
      The First Consul will receive my resignation to-morrow; others, who are
      not of my stripe, may obey you. I do not understand my orders and
      therefore I stop short,&mdash;all the more because I am supposed to
      understand them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, but it was soon broken by the young lady,
      who went up to the commandant and held out her hand, saying, &ldquo;Colonel,
      though your beard is somewhat long, you may kiss my hand; you are, indeed,
      a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself I am, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he replied, depositing a kiss upon
      the hand of this singular young woman rather awkwardly. &ldquo;As for you,
      friend,&rdquo; he said, threatening the young man with his finger, &ldquo;you have had
      a narrow escape this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;it is time all this nonsense should cease;
      I am ready to go with you, if you like, to headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bring your invisible owl, Marche-a-Terre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Marche-a-Terre?&rdquo; asked the young man, showing all the signs of
      genuine surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he hoot just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did that hooting have to do with me, I should like to know? I
      supposed it was your soldiers letting you know of their arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, you did not think that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. But do drink that glass of Bordeaux; the wine is good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised at the natural behaviour of the youth and also by the frivolity
      of his manners and the youthfulness of his face, made even more juvenile
      by the careful curling of his fair hair, the commandant hesitated in the
      midst of his suspicions. He noticed that Madame du Gua was intently
      watching the glances that her son gave to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, and he
      asked her abruptly: &ldquo;How old are you, <i>citoyenne</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur l&rsquo;officier,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the rules of the Republic are very
      severe; must I tell you that I am thirty-eight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be shot if I believe it! Marche-a-Terre is here; it was he who gave
      that cry; you are Chouans in disguise. God&rsquo;s thunder! I&rsquo;ll search the inn
      and make sure of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a hoot, somewhat like those that preceded it, came from the
      courtyard; the commandant rushed out, and missed seeing the pallor that
      covered Madame du Gua&rsquo;s face as he spoke. Hulot saw at once that the sound
      came from a postilion harnessing his horses to the coach, and he cast
      aside his suspicions, all the more because it seemed absurd to suppose
      that the Chouans would risk themselves in Alencon. He returned to the
      house confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive him now, but later he shall pay dear for the anxiety he has
      given us,&rdquo; said the mother to the son, in a low voice, as Hulot re-entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brave old officer showed on his worried face the struggle that went on
      in his mind betwixt a stern sense of duty and the natural kindness of his
      heart. He kept his gruff air, partly, perhaps, because he fancied he had
      deceived himself, but he took the glass of Bordeaux, and said: &ldquo;Excuse me,
      comrade, but your Polytechnique does send such young officers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chouans have younger ones,&rdquo; said the youth, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom did you take my son?&rdquo; asked Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the Gars, the leader sent to the Chouans and the Vendeans by the
      British cabinet; his real name is Marquis de Montauran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant watched the faces of the suspected pair, who looked at each
      other with a puzzled expression that seemed to say: &ldquo;Do you know that
      name?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, do you?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is he talking about?&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden change in the manner of Marie de Verneuil, and her torpor as
      she heard the name of the royalist general was observed by no one but
      Francine, the only person to whom the least shade on that young face was
      visible. Completely routed, the commandant picked up the bits of his
      broken sword, looked at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, whose ardent beauty was
      beginning to find its way to his heart, and said: &ldquo;As for you,
      mademoiselle, I take nothing back, and to-morrow these fragments of my
      sword will reach Bonaparte, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! what do I care for Bonaparte, or your republic, or the king, or the
      Gars?&rdquo; she cried, scarcely repressing an explosion of ill-bred temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mysterious emotion, the passion of which gave to her face a dazzling
      color, showed that the whole world was nothing to the girl the moment that
      one individual was all in all to her. But she suddenly subdued herself
      into forced calmness, observing, like a trained actor, that the spectators
      were watching her. The commandant rose hastily and went out. Anxious and
      agitated, Mademoiselle de Verneuil followed him, stopped him in the
      corridor, and said, in an almost solemn tone: &ldquo;Have you any good reason to
      suspect that young man of being the Gars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder! mademoiselle, that fellow who rode here with you came back
      to warn me that the travellers in the mail-coach had all been murdered by
      the Chouans; I knew that, but what I didn&rsquo;t know was the name of the
      murdered persons,&mdash;it was Gua de Saint-Cyr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if Corentin is at the bottom of all this, nothing surprises me,&rdquo; she
      cried, with a gesture of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commandant went his way without daring to look at Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil, whose dangerous beauty began to affect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had stayed two minutes longer I should have committed the folly of
      taking back my sword and escorting her,&rdquo; he was saying to himself as he
      went down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Madame du Gua watched the young man, whose eyes were fixed on the door
      through which Mademoiselle de Verneuil had passed, she said to him in a
      low voice: &ldquo;You are incorrigible. You will perish through a woman. A doll
      can make you forget everything. Why did you allow her to breakfast with
      us? Who is a Demoiselle de Verneuil escorted by the Blues, who accepts a
      breakfast from strangers and disarms an officer with a piece of paper
      hidden in the bosom of her gown like a love-letter? She is one of those
      contemptible creatures by whose aid Fouche expects to lay hold of you, and
      the paper she showed the commandant ordered the Blues to assist her
      against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! madame,&rdquo; he replied in a sharp tone which went to the lady&rsquo;s heart
      and turned her pale; &ldquo;her generous action disproves your supposition. Pray
      remember that the welfare of the king is the sole bond between us. You,
      who have had Charette at your feet must find the world without him empty;
      are you not living to avenge him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady stood still and pensive, like one who sees from the shore the
      wreck of all her treasures, and only the more eagerly longs for the
      vanished property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the room; the young man exchanged a
      smile with her and gave her a glance full of gentle meaning. However
      uncertain the future might seem, however ephemeral their union, the
      promises of their sudden love were only the more endearing to them. Rapid
      as the glance was, it did not escape the sagacious eye of Madame du Gua,
      who instantly understood it; her brow clouded, and she was unable to
      wholly conceal her jealous anger. Francine was observing her; she saw the
      eyes glitter, the cheeks flush; she thought she perceived a diabolical
      spirit in the face, stirred by some sudden and terrible revulsion. But
      lightning is not more rapid, nor death more prompt than this brief
      exhibition of inward emotion. Madame du Gua recovered her lively manner
      with such immediate self-possession that Francine fancied herself
      mistaken. Nevertheless, having once perceived in this woman a violence of
      feeling that was fully equal to that of Mademoiselle de Verneuil, she
      trembled as she foresaw the clash with which such natures might come
      together, and the girl shuddered when she saw Mademoiselle de Verneuil go
      up to the young man with a passionate look and, taking him by the hand,
      draw him close beside her and into the light, with a coquettish glance
      that was full of witchery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, trying to read his eyes, &ldquo;own to me that you are not the
      citizen du Gua Saint-Cyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he and his mother were killed yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry for that,&rdquo; he replied, laughing. &ldquo;However that may be, I
      am none the less under a great obligation to you, for which I shall always
      feel the deepest gratitude and only wish I could prove it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was saving an <i>emigre</i>, but I love you better as a
      Republican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words escaped her lips as it were impulsively; she became confused;
      even her eyes blushed, and her face bore no other expression than one of
      exquisite simplicity of feeling; she softly released the young man&rsquo;s hand,
      not from shame at having pressed it, but because of a thought too weighty,
      it seemed, for her heart to bear, leaving him drunk with hope. Suddenly
      she appeared to regret this freedom, permissible as it might be under the
      passing circumstances of a journey. She recovered her conventional manner,
      bowed to the lady and her son, and taking Francine with her, left the
      room. When they reached their own chamber Francine wrung her hands and
      tossed her arms, as she looked at her mistress, saying: &ldquo;Ah, Marie, what a
      crowd of things in a moment of time! who but you would have such
      adventures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil sprang forward and clasped Francine round the
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! this is life indeed&mdash;I am in heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or hell,&rdquo; retorted Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hell if you like!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;Here, give me
      your hand; feel my heart, how it beats. There&rsquo;s fever in my veins; the
      whole world is now a mere nothing to me! How many times have I not seen
      that man in my dreams! Oh! how beautiful his head is&mdash;how his eyes
      sparkle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he love you?&rdquo; said the simple peasant-woman, in a quivering voice,
      her face full of sad foreboding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask me that!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;But, Francine,
      tell me,&rdquo; she added throwing herself into a pose that was half serious,
      half comic, &ldquo;will it be very hard to love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but will he love you always?&rdquo; replied Francine, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other for a moment speechless,&mdash;Francine at
      revealing so much knowledge of life, and Marie at the perception, which
      now came to her for the first time, of a future of happiness in her
      passion. She seemed to herself hanging over a gulf of which she had wanted
      to know the depth, and listening to the fall of the stone she had flung,
      at first heedlessly, into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is my own affair,&rdquo; she said, with the gesture of a gambler. &ldquo;I
      should never pity a betrayed woman; she has no one but herself to blame if
      she is abandoned. I shall know how to keep, either living or dead, the man
      whose heart has once been mine. But,&rdquo; she added, with some surprise and
      after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;where did you get your knowledge of love,
      Francine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the peasant-woman, hastily, &ldquo;hush, I hear steps in
      the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! not <i>his</i> steps!&rdquo; said Marie, listening. &ldquo;But you are evading an
      answer; well, well, I&rsquo;ll wait for it, or guess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine was right, however. Three taps on the door interrupted the
      conversation. Captain Merle appeared, after receiving Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil&rsquo;s permission to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a military salute to the lady, whose beauty dazzled him, the soldier
      ventured on giving her a glance, but he found nothing better to say than:
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I am at your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are to be my protector, in place of the commander, who retires;
      is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my superior is the adjutant-major Gerard, who has sent me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your commandant must be very much afraid of me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, mademoiselle, Hulot is afraid of nothing. But women, you see,
      are not in his line; it ruffled him to have a general in a mob-cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; continued Mademoiselle de Verneuil, &ldquo;it was his duty to obey
      his superiors. I like subordination, and I warn you that I shall allow no
      one to disobey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be difficult,&rdquo; replied Merle, gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us consult,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;You can get fresh troops
      here and accompany me to Mayenne, which I must reach this evening. Shall
      we find other soldiers there, so that I might go on at once, without
      stopping at Mayenne? The Chouans are quite ignorant of our little
      expedition. If we travel at night, we can avoid meeting any number of
      them, and so escape an attack. Do you think this feasible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of road is it between Mayenne and Fougeres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rough; all up and down, a regular squirrel-wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us start at once. As we have nothing to fear near Alencon, you
      can go before me; we&rsquo;ll join you soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think she had seen ten years&rsquo; service,&rdquo; thought Merle, as he
      departed. &ldquo;Hulot is mistaken; that young girl is not earning her living
      out of a feather-bed. Ten thousand carriages! if I want to be
      adjutant-major I mustn&rsquo;t be such a fool as to mistake Saint-Michael for
      the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s conference with the captain, Francine
      had slipped out for the purpose of examining, through a window of the
      corridor, the spot in the courtyard which had excited her curiosity on
      arriving at the inn. She watched the stable and the heaps of straw with
      the absorption of one who was saying her prayers to the Virgin, and she
      presently saw Madame du Gua approaching Marche-a-Terre with the precaution
      of a cat that dislikes to wet its feet. When the Chouan caught sight of
      the lady, he rose and stood before her in an attitude of deep respect.
      This singular circumstance aroused Francine&rsquo;s curiosity; she slipped into
      the courtyard and along the walls, avoiding Madame du Gua&rsquo;s notice, and
      trying to hide herself behind the stable door. She walked on tiptoe,
      scarcely daring to breathe, and succeeded in posting herself close to
      Marche-a-Terre, without exciting his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, after all this information,&rdquo; the lady was saying to the Chouan, &ldquo;it
      proves not to be her real name, you are to fire upon her without pity, as
      you would on a mad dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady left him. The Chouan replaced his red woollen cap upon his head,
      remained standing, and was scratching his ear as if puzzled when Francine
      suddenly appeared before him, apparently by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Anne of Auray!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Then he dropped his whip, clasped his
      hands, and stood as if in ecstasy. A faint color illuminated his coarse
      face, and his eyes shone like diamonds dropped on a muck-heap. &ldquo;Is it
      really the brave girl from Cottin?&rdquo; he muttered, in a voice so smothered
      that he alone heard it. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> fine,&rdquo; he said, after a pause,
      using the curious word, &ldquo;godaine,&rdquo; a superlative in the dialect of those
      regions used by lovers to express the combination of fine clothes and
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t touch you,&rdquo; added Marche-a-Terre, putting out his big hand
      nevertheless, as if to weigh the gold chain which hung round her neck and
      below her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not, Pierre,&rdquo; replied Francine, inspired by the instinct
      which makes a woman despotic when not oppressed. She drew back haughtily,
      after enjoying the Chouan&rsquo;s surprise; but she compensated for the
      harshness of her words by the softness of her glance, saying, as she once
      more approached him: &ldquo;Pierre, that lady was talking to you about my young
      mistress, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre was silent; his face struggled, like the dawn, between
      clouds and light. He looked in turn at Francine, at the whip he had
      dropped, and at the chain, which seemed to have as powerful an attraction
      for him as the Breton girl herself. Then, as if to put a stop to his own
      uneasiness, he picked up his whip and still kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is easy to see that that lady told you to kill my mistress,&rdquo;
       resumed Francine, who knew the faithful discretion of the peasant, and
      wished to relieve his scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre lowered his head significantly. To the Cottin girl that was
      answer enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Pierre,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if any evil happens to her, if a hair of
      her head is injured, you and I will have seen each other for the last
      time; for I shall be in heaven, and you will go to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The possessed of devils whom the Church in former days used to exorcise
      with great pomp were not more shaken and agitated than Marche-a-Terre at
      this prophecy, uttered with a conviction that gave it certainty. His
      glance, which at first had a character of savage tenderness, counteracted
      by a fanaticism as powerful in his soul as love, suddenly became surly, as
      he felt the imperious manner of the girl he had long since chosen.
      Francine interpreted his silence in her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do anything for my sake?&rdquo; she said in a tone of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the Chouan cast a glance at his mistress from eyes that
      were black as a crow&rsquo;s wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you free?&rdquo; he asked in a growl that Francine alone could have
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I be here if I were not?&rdquo; she replied indignantly. &ldquo;But you, what
      are you doing here? Still playing bandit, still roaming the country like a
      mad dog wanting to bite. Oh! Pierre, if you were wise, you would come with
      me. This beautiful young lady, who, I ought to tell you, was nursed when a
      baby in our home, has taken care of me. I have two hundred francs a year
      from a good investment. And Mademoiselle has bought me my uncle Thomas&rsquo;s
      big house for fifteen hundred francs, and I have saved two thousand
      beside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her smiles and the announcement of her wealth fell dead before the
      dogged immovability of the Chouan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priests have told us to go to war,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Every Blue we shoot
      earns one indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the Blues shoot you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered by letting his arms drop at his sides, as if regretting the
      poverty of the offering he should thus make to God and the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of me?&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre looked at her stupidly; his eyes seemed to enlarge; tears
      rolled down his hairy cheeks upon the goatskin which covered him, and a
      low moan came from his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Anne of Auray!&mdash;Pierre, is this all you have to say to me
      after a parting of seven years? You have changed indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you the same as ever,&rdquo; said the Chouan, in a gruff voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the king is first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you look at me like that I shall go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, adieu,&rdquo; she replied, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand, wrung it, kissed it, made the sign of the cross, and
      rushed into the stable, like a dog who fears that his bone will be taken
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pille-Miche,&rdquo; he said to his comrade. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your tobacco-box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! <i>sacre bleu</i>! what a fine chain!&rdquo; cried Pille-Miche, fumbling in
      a pocket constructed in his goatskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he held out to Marche-a-Terre the little horn in which Bretons put
      the finely powdered tobacco which they prepare themselves during the long
      winter nights. The Chouan raised his thumb and made a hollow in the palm
      of his hand, after the manner in which an &ldquo;Invalide&rdquo; takes his tobacco;
      then he shook the horn, the small end of which Pille-Miche had unscrewed.
      A fine powder fell slowly from the little hole pierced in the point of
      this Breton utensil. Marche-a-Terre went through the same process seven or
      eight times silently, as if the powder had power to change the current of
      his thoughts. Suddenly he flung the horn to Pille-Miche with a gesture of
      despair, and caught up a gun which was hidden in the straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven or eight shakes at once! I suppose you think that costs nothing!&rdquo;
       said the stingy Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s work before
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Thirty or more Chouans who were sleeping in the straw under the mangers,
      raised their heads, saw Marche-a-Terre on his feet, and disappeared
      instantly through a door which led to the garden, from which it was easy
      to reach the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Francine left the stable she found the mail-coach ready to start.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil and her new fellow-travellers were already in it.
      The girl shuddered as she saw her young mistress sitting side by side with
      the woman who had just ordered her death. The young man had taken his seat
      facing Marie, and as soon as Francine was in hers the heavy vehicle
      started at a good pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had swept away the gray autumnal mists, and its rays were
      brightening the gloomy landscape with a look of youth and holiday. Many
      lovers fancy that such chance accidents of the sky are premonitions.
      Francine was surprised at the strange silence which fell upon the
      travellers. Mademoiselle de Verneuil had recovered her cold manner, and
      sat with her eyes lowered, her head slightly inclined, and her hands
      hidden under a sort of mantle in which she had wrapped herself. If she
      raised her eyes it was only to look at the passing scenery. Certain of
      being admired, she rejected admiration; but her apparent indifference was
      evidently more coquettish than natural. Purity, which gives such harmony
      to the diverse expressions by which a simple soul reveals itself, could
      lend no charm to a being whose every instinct predestined her to the
      storms of passion. Yielding himself up to the pleasures of this dawning
      intrigue, the young man did not try to explain the contradictions which
      were obvious between the coquetry and the enthusiasm of this singular
      young girl. Her assumed indifference allowed him to examine at his ease a
      face which was now as beautiful in its calmness as it had been when
      agitated. Like the rest of us, he was not disposed to question the sources
      of his enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult for a pretty woman to avoid the glances of her companions
      in a carriage when their eyes fasten upon her as a visible distraction to
      the monotony of a journey. Happy, therefore, in being able to satisfy the
      hunger of his dawning passion, without offence or avoidance on the part of
      its object, the young man studied the pure and brilliant lines of the
      girl&rsquo;s head and face. To him they were a picture. Sometimes the light
      brought out the transparent rose of the nostrils and the double curve
      which united the nose with the upper lip; at other times a pale glint of
      sunshine illuminated the tints of the skin, pearly beneath the eyes and
      round the mouth, rosy on the cheeks, and ivory-white about the temples and
      throat. He admired the contrasts of light and shade caused by the masses
      of black hair surrounding her face and giving it an ephemeral grace,&mdash;for
      all is fleeting in a woman; her beauty of to-day is often not that of
      yesterday, fortunately for herself, perhaps! The young man, who was still
      at an age when youth delights in the nothings which are the all of love,
      watched eagerly for each movement of the eyelids, and the seductive rise
      and fall of her bosom as she breathed. Sometimes he fancied, suiting the
      tenor of his thoughts, that he could see a meaning in the expression of
      the eyes and the imperceptible inflection of the lips. Every gesture
      betrayed to him the soul, every motion a new aspect of the young girl. If
      a thought stirred those mobile features, if a sudden blush suffused the
      cheeks, or a smile brought life into the face, he found a fresh delight in
      trying to discover the secrets of this mysterious creature. Everything
      about her was a snare to the soul and a snare to the senses. Even the
      silence that fell between them, far from raising an obstacle to the
      understanding of their hearts, became the common ground for mutual
      thoughts. But after a while the many looks in which their eyes encountered
      each other warned Marie de Verneuil that the silence was compromising her,
      and she turned to Madame du Gua with one of those commonplace remarks
      which open the way to conversation; but even in so doing she included the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could you put your son into the navy? have you
      not doomed yourself to perpetual anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, the fate of women, of mothers, I should say, is to tremble
      for the safety of their dear ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son is very like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile with which the young man listened to these remarks increased the
      vexation of his pretended mother. Her hatred grew with every passionate
      glance he turned on Marie. Silence or conversation, all increased the
      dreadful wrath which she carefully concealed beneath a cordial manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;you are quite mistaken. Naval men are
      not more exposed to danger than soldiers. Women ought not to dislike the
      navy; we sailors have a merit beyond that of the military,&mdash;we are
      faithful to our mistresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from necessity,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even so, it is fidelity,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua, in a deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation grew lively, touching upon subjects that were interesting
      to none but the three travellers, for under such circumstances intelligent
      persons given new meanings to commonplace talk; but every word,
      insignificant as it might seem, was a mutual interrogation, hiding the
      desires, hopes, and passions which agitated them. Marie&rsquo;s cleverness and
      quick perception (for she was fully on her guard) showed Madame du Gua
      that calumny and treachery could alone avail to triumph over a rival as
      formidable through her intellect as by her beauty. The mail-coach
      presently overtook the escort, and then advanced more slowly. The young
      man, seeing a long hill before them, proposed to the young lady that they
      should walk. The friendly politeness of his offer decided her, and her
      consent flattered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Madame of our opinion?&rdquo; she said, turning to Madame du Gua. &ldquo;Will she
      walk, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coquette!&rdquo; said the lady to herself, as she left the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie and the young man walked together, but a little apart. The sailor,
      full of ardent desires, was determined to break the reserve that checked
      him, of which, however, he was not the dupe. He fancied that he could
      succeed by dallying with the young lady in that tone of courteous
      amiability and wit, sometimes frivolous, sometimes serious, which
      characterized the men of the exiled aristocracy. But the smiling Parisian
      beauty parried him so mischievously, and rejected his frivolities with
      such disdain, evidently preferring the stronger ideas and enthusiasms
      which he betrayed from time to time in spite of himself, that he presently
      began to understand the true way of pleasing her. The conversation then
      changed. He realized the hopes her expressive face had given him; yet, as
      he did so, new difficulties arose, and he was still forced to suspend his
      judgment on a girl who seemed to take delight in thwarting him, a siren
      with whom he grew more and more in love. After yielding to the seduction
      of her beauty, he was still more attracted to her mysterious soul, with a
      curiosity which Marie perceived and took pleasure in exciting. Their
      intercourse assumed, insensibly, a character of intimacy far removed from
      the tone of indifference which Mademoiselle de Verneuil endeavored in vain
      to give to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Madame du Gua had followed the lovers, the latter had unconsciously
      walked so much more rapidly than she that a distance of several hundred
      feet soon separated them. The charming pair trod the fine sand beneath
      their feet, listening with childlike delight to the union of their
      footsteps, happy in being wrapped by the same ray of a sunshine that
      seemed spring-like, in breathing with the same breath autumnal perfumes
      laden with vegetable odors which seemed a nourishment brought by the
      breezes to their dawning love. Though to them it may have been a mere
      circumstance of their fortuitous meeting, yet the sky, the landscape, the
      season of the year, did communicate to their emotions a tinge of
      melancholy gravity which gave them an element of passion. They praised the
      weather and talked of its beauty; then of their strange encounter, of the
      coming rupture of an intercourse so delightful; of the ease with which, in
      travelling, friendships, lost as soon as made, are formed. After this last
      remark, the young man profited by what seemed to be a tacit permission to
      make a few tender confidences, and to risk an avowal of love like a man
      who was not unaccustomed to such situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how little the feelings of the
      heart follow the old conventional rules in the days of terror in which we
      live? Everything about us bears the stamp of suddenness. We love in a day,
      or we hate on the strength of a single glance. We are bound to each other
      for life in a moment, or we part with the celerity of death itself. All
      things are hurried, like the convulsions of the nation. In the midst of
      such dangers as ours the ties that bind should be stronger than under the
      ordinary course of life. In Paris during the Terror, every one came to
      know the full meaning of a clasp of the hand as men do on a battle-field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People felt the necessity of living fast and ardently,&rdquo; she answered,
      &ldquo;for they had little time to live.&rdquo; Then, with a glance at her companion
      which seemed to tell him that the end of their short intercourse was
      approaching, she added, maliciously: &ldquo;You are very well informed as to the
      affairs of life, for a young man who has just left the Ecole
      Polytechnique!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of me?&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;Tell me
      frankly, without disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to acquire the right to speak to me of myself,&rdquo; she said
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer me,&rdquo; he went on after a slight pause. &ldquo;Take care,
      silence is sometimes significant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I cannot guess all that you would like to say to me? Good
      heavens! you have already said enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if we understand each other,&rdquo; he replied, smiling, &ldquo;I have obtained
      more than I dared hope for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in return so graciously that she seemed to accept the courteous
      struggle into which all men like to draw a woman. They persuaded
      themselves, half in jest, half in earnest, that they never could be more
      to each other than they were at that moment. The young man fancied,
      therefore, he might give reins to a passion that could have no future; the
      young woman felt she might smile upon it. Marie suddenly struck her foot
      against a stone and stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my arm,&rdquo; said her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems I must,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;you would be too proud if I refused; you
      would fancy I feared you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, pressing her arm against his heart that she
      might feel the beating of it, &ldquo;you flatter my pride by granting such a
      favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the readiness with which I do so will cure your illusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to save me from the danger of the emotions you cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;do not try to entangle me in such boudoir
      riddles. I don&rsquo;t like to find the wit of fools in a man of your character.
      See! here we are beneath the glorious sky, in the open country; before us,
      above us, all is grand. You wish to tell me that I am beautiful, do you
      not? Well, your eyes have already told me so; besides, I know it; I am not
      a woman whom mere compliments can please. But perhaps you would like,&rdquo;
       this with satirical emphasis, &ldquo;to talk about your <i>sentiments</i>? Do
      you think me so simple as to believe that sudden sympathies are powerful
      enough to influence a whole life through the recollections of one
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the recollections of a morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but those of a beautiful
      woman who has shown herself generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; she retorted, laughing, &ldquo;half my attractions,&mdash;a
      mysterious woman, with everything odd about her, name, rank, situation,
      freedom of thought and manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not mysterious to me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have fathomed you; there
      is nothing that could be added to your perfections except a little more
      faith in the love you inspire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my poor child of eighteen, what can you know of love?&rdquo; she said
      smiling. &ldquo;Well, well, so be it!&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;it is a fair subject of
      conversation, like the weather when one pays a visit. You shall find that
      I have neither false modesty nor petty fears. I can hear the word love
      without blushing; it has been so often said to me without one echo of the
      heart that I think it quite unmeaning. I have met with it everywhere, in
      books, at the theatre, in society,&mdash;yes, everywhere, and never have I
      found in it even a semblance of its magnificent ideal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you seek that ideal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word was said with such perfect ease and freedom that the young man
      made a gesture of surprise and looked at Marie fixedly, as if he had
      suddenly changed his opinion on her character and real position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said with ill-concealed devotion, &ldquo;are you maid or
      wife, angel or devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All,&rdquo; she replied, laughing. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something diabolic and also
      angelic in a young girl who has never loved, does not love, and perhaps
      will never love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think yourself happy thus?&rdquo; he asked with a free and easy tone and
      manner, as though already he felt less respect for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, happy, no,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;When I think that I am alone, hampered by
      social conventions that make me deceitful, I envy the privileges of a man.
      But when I also reflect on the means which nature has bestowed on us women
      to catch and entangle you men in the invisible meshes of a power which you
      cannot resist, then the part assigned to me in the world is not
      displeasing to me. And then again, suddenly, it does seem very petty, and
      I feel that I should despise a man who allowed himself to be duped by such
      vulgar seductions. No sooner do I perceive our power and like it, than I
      know it to be horrible and I abhor it. Sometimes I feel within me that
      longing towards devotion which makes my sex so nobly beautiful; and then I
      feel a desire, which consumes me, for dominion and power. Perhaps it is
      the natural struggle of the good and the evil principle in which all
      creatures live here below. Angel or devil! you have expressed it. Ah!
      to-day is not the first time that I have recognized my double nature. But
      we women understand better than you men can do our own shortcomings. We
      have an instinct which shows us a perfection in all things to which,
      nevertheless, we fail to attain. But,&rdquo; she added, sighing as she glanced
      at the sky; &ldquo;that which enhances us in your eyes is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that we are all struggling, more or less,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;against
      a thwarted destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, why should we part to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she replied, smiling at the passionate look which he gave her, &ldquo;let
      us get into the carriage; the open air does not agree with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie turned abruptly; the young man followed her, and pressed her arm
      with little respect, but in a manner that expressed his imperious
      admiration. She hastened her steps. Seeing that she wished to escape an
      importune declaration, he became the more ardent; being determined to win
      a first favor from this woman, he risked all and said, looking at her
      meaningly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quickly, if it concerns you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the service of the Republic. Where are you going? I shall
      follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words Marie trembled violently. She withdrew her arm and covered
      her face with both hands to hide either the flush or the pallor of her
      cheeks; then she suddenly uncovered her face and said in a voice of deep
      emotion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you began as you would have ended, by deceiving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this answer she turned again from the carriage, which was now
      overtaking them, and began to almost run along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, following her, &ldquo;that the open air did not agree with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it has changed,&rdquo; she replied in a grave tone, continuing to walk on,
      a prey to agitating thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer me,&rdquo; said the young man, his heart full of the soft
      expectation of coming pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, in a strained voice, &ldquo;the tragedy begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tragedy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, looked at the young student from head to foot with a
      mingled expression of fear and curiosity; then she concealed her feelings
      that were agitating her under the mask of an impenetrable calmness,
      showing that for a girl of her age she had great experience of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she said,&mdash;&ldquo;but I know already; when I first saw you I
      suspected it. You are the royalist leader whom they call the Gars. The
      ex-bishop of Autun was right in saying we should always believe in
      presentiments which give warning of evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What interest have you in knowing the Gars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What interest has he in concealing himself from me who have already saved
      his life?&rdquo; She began to laugh, but the merriment was forced. &ldquo;I have
      wisely prevented you from saying that you love me. Let me tell you,
      monsieur, that I abhor you. I am republican, you are royalist; I would
      deliver you up if you were not under my protection, and if I had not
      already saved your life, and if&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped. These violent
      extremes of feeling and the inward struggle which she no longer attempted
      to conceal alarmed the young man, who tried, but in vain, to observe her
      calmly. &ldquo;Let us part here at once,&mdash;I insist upon it; farewell!&rdquo; she
      said. She turned hastily back, made a few steps, and then returned to him.
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I have too great an interest in knowing who you
      are. Hide nothing from me; tell me the truth. Who are you? for you are no
      more a pupil of the Ecole Polytechnique than you are eighteen years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a sailor, ready to leave the ocean and follow you wherever your
      imagination may lead you. If I have been so lucky as to rouse your
      curiosity in any particular I shall be very careful not to lessen it. Why
      mingle the serious affairs of real life with the life of the heart in
      which we are beginning to understand each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our souls might have understood each other,&rdquo; she said in a grave voice.
      &ldquo;But I have no right to exact your confidence. You will never know the
      extent of your obligations to me; I shall not explain them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked a few steps in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life does interest you,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I implore you, tell me your name or else be silent. You are a
      child,&rdquo; she added, with an impatient movement of her shoulders, &ldquo;and I
      feel a pity for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obstinacy with which she insisted on knowing his name made the
      pretended sailor hesitate between prudence and love. The vexation of a
      desired woman is powerfully attractive; her anger, like her submission, is
      imperious; many are the fibres she touches in a man&rsquo;s heart, penetrating
      and subjugating it. Was this scene only another aspect of Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil&rsquo;s coquetry? In spite of his sudden passion the unnamed lover had
      the strength to distrust a woman thus bent on forcing from him a secret of
      life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has my rash indiscretion, which sought to give a future to our
      present meeting, destroyed the happiness of it?&rdquo; he said, taking her hand,
      which she left in his unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who seemed to be in real distress, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How have I displeased you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can I do to soothe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, and they walked some distance in silence. Suddenly
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil stopped short, like one who has come to some
      serious determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis de Montauran,&rdquo; she said, with dignity, but without
      being able to conceal entirely the nervous trembling of her features, &ldquo;I
      desire to do you a great service, whatever it may cost me. We part here.
      The coach and its escort are necessary for your protection, and you must
      continue your journey in it. Fear nothing from the Republicans; they are
      men of honor, and I shall give the adjutant certain orders which he will
      faithfully execute. As for me, I shall return on foot to Alencon with my
      maid, and take a few of the soldiers with me. Listen to what I say, for
      your life depends on it. If, before you reach a place of safety, you meet
      that odious man you saw in my company at the inn, escape at once, for he
      will instantly betray you. As for me,&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, &ldquo;as for me, I
      fling myself back into the miseries of life. Farewell, monsieur, may you
      be happy; farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a sign to Captain Merle, who was just then reaching the brow of
      the hill behind her. The marquis was taken unawares by her sudden action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, in a tone of despair that was well acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This singular caprice of a girl for whom he would at that instant have
      thrown away his life so surprised him that he invented, on the spur of the
      moment, a fatal fiction by which to hide his name and satisfy the
      curiosity of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have almost guessed the truth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am an <i>emigre</i>,
      condemned to death, and my name is Vicomte de Bauvan. Love of my country
      has brought me back to France to join my brother. I hope to be taken off
      the list of <i>emigres</i> through the influence of Madame de Beauharnais,
      now the wife of the First Consul; but if I fail in this, I mean to die on
      the soil of my native land, fighting beside my friend Montauran. I am now
      on my way secretly, by means of a passport he has sent me, to learn if any
      of my property in Brittany is still unconfiscated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the young man spoke Mademoiselle de Verneuil examined him with a
      penetrating eye. She tried at first to doubt his words, but being by
      nature confiding and trustful, she slowly regained an expression of
      serenity, and said eagerly, &ldquo;Monsieur, are you telling me the exact
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the exact truth,&rdquo; replied the young man, who seemed to have no
      conscience in his dealings with women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil gave a deep sigh, like a person who returns to
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I am very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you hate that poor Montauran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I could not make you understand my meaning. I was not
      willing that <i>you</i> should meet the dangers from which I will try to
      protect him,&mdash;since he is your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that Montauran was in danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, monsieur, even if I had not come from Paris, where his enterprise is
      the one thing talked of, the commandant at Alencon said enough to show his
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me ask you how you expect to save him from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I do not choose to answer,&rdquo; she replied, with the haughty air
      that women often assume to hide an emotion. &ldquo;What right have you to know
      my secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of a man who loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, you do not love me. I am only an object of
      passing gallantry to you,&mdash;that is all. I am clear-sighted; did I not
      penetrate your disguise at once? A woman who knows anything of good
      society could not be misled, in these days, by a pupil of the
      Polytechnique who uses choice language, and conceals as little as you do
      the manners of a <i>grand seigneur</i> under the mask of a Republican.
      There is a trifle of powder left in your hair, and a fragrance of nobility
      clings to you which a woman of the world cannot fail to detect. Therefore,
      fearing that the man whom you saw accompanying me, who has all the
      shrewdness of a woman, might make the same discovery, I sent him away.
      Monsieur, let me tell you that a true Republican officer just from the
      Polytechnique would not have made love to me as you have done, and would
      not have taken me for a pretty adventuress. Allow me, Monsieur de Bauvan,
      to preach you a little sermon from a woman&rsquo;s point of view. Are you too
      juvenile to know that of all the creatures of my sex the most difficult to
      subdue is that same adventuress,&mdash;she whose price is ticketed and who
      is weary of pleasure. That sort of woman requires, they tell me, constant
      seduction; she yields only to her own caprices; any attempt to please her
      argues, I should suppose, great conceit on the part of a man. But let us
      put aside that class of women, among whom you have been good enough to
      rank me; you ought to understand that a young woman, handsome, brilliant,
      and of noble birth (for, I suppose, you will grant me those advantages),
      does not sell herself, and can only be won by the man who loves her in one
      way. You understand me? If she loves him and is willing to commit a folly,
      she must be justified by great and heroic reasons. Forgive me this logic,
      rare in my sex; but for the sake of your happiness,&mdash;and my own,&rdquo; she
      added, dropping her head,&mdash;&ldquo;I will not allow either of us to deceive
      the other, nor will I permit you to think that Mademoiselle de Verneuil,
      angel or devil, maid or wife, is capable of being seduced by commonplace
      gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the marquis, whose surprise, though he concealed it,
      was extreme, and who at once became a man of the great world, &ldquo;I entreat
      you to believe that I take you to be a very noble person, full of the
      highest sentiments, or&mdash;a charming girl, as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask all that,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;Allow me to keep my
      incognito. My mask is better than yours, and it pleases me to wear it,&mdash;if
      only to discover whether those who talk to me of love are sincere.
      Therefore, beware of me! Monsieur,&rdquo; she cried, catching his arm
      vehemently, &ldquo;listen to me; if you were able to prove that your love is
      true, nothing, no human power, could part us. Yes, I would fain unite
      myself to the noble destiny of some great man, and marry a vast ambition,
      glorious hopes! Noble hearts are never faithless, for constancy is in
      their fibre; I should be forever loved, forever happy,&mdash;I would make
      my body a stepping-stone by which to raise the man who loved me; I would
      sacrifice all things to him, bear all things from him, and love him
      forever,&mdash;even if he ceased to love me. I have never before dared to
      confess to another heart the secrets of mine, nor the passionate
      enthusiasms which exhaust me; but I tell you something of them now
      because, as soon as I have seen you in safety, we shall part forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part? never!&rdquo; he cried, electrified by the tones of that vigorous soul
      which seemed to be fighting against some overwhelming thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you free?&rdquo; she said, with a haughty glance which subdued him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free! yes, except for the sentence of death which hangs over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She added presently, in a voice full of bitter feeling: &ldquo;If all this were
      not a dream, a glorious life might indeed be ours. But I have been talking
      folly; let us beware of committing any. When I think of all you would have
      to be before you could rate me at my proper value I doubt everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt nothing if you will only grant me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she cried, hearing a note of true passion in his voice, &ldquo;the open
      air is decidedly disagreeing with us; let us return to the coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That vehicle soon came up; they took their places and drove on several
      miles in total silence. Both had matter for reflection, but henceforth
      their eyes no longer feared to meet. Each now seemed to have an equal
      interest in observing the other, and in mutually hiding important secrets;
      but for all that they were drawn together by one and the same impulse,
      which now, as a result of this interview, assumed the dimensions of a
      passion. They recognized in each other qualities which promised to
      heighten all the pleasures to be derived from either their contest or
      their union. Perhaps both of them, living a life of adventure, had reached
      the singular moral condition in which, either from weariness or in
      defiance of fate, the mind rejects serious reflection and flings itself on
      chance in pursuing an enterprise precisely because the issues of chance
      are unknown, and the interest of expecting them vivid. The moral nature,
      like the physical nature, has its abysses into which strong souls love to
      plunge, risking their future as gamblers risk their fortune. Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil and the young marquis had obtained a revelation of each
      other&rsquo;s minds as a consequence of this interview, and their intercourse
      thus took rapid strides, for the sympathy of their souls succeeded to that
      of their senses. Besides, the more they felt fatally drawn to each other,
      the more eager they were to study the secret action of their minds. The
      so-called Vicomte de Bauvan, surprised at the seriousness of the strange
      girl&rsquo;s ideas, asked himself how she could possibly combine such acquired
      knowledge of life with so much youth and freshness. He thought he
      discovered an extreme desire to appear chaste in the modesty and reserve
      of her attitudes. He suspected her of playing a part; he questioned the
      nature of his own pleasure; and ended by choosing to consider her a clever
      actress. He was right; Mademoiselle de Verneuil, like other women of the
      world, grew the more reserved the more she felt the warmth of her own
      feelings, assuming with perfect naturalness the appearance of prudery,
      beneath which such women veil their desires. They all wish to offer
      themselves as virgins on love&rsquo;s altar; and if they are not so, the
      deception they seek to practise is at least a homage which they pay to
      their lovers. These thoughts passed rapidly through the mind of the young
      man and gratified him. In fact, for both, this mutual examination was an
      advance in their intercourse, and the lover soon came to that phase of
      passion in which a man finds in the defects of his mistress a reason for
      loving her the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was thoughtful. Perhaps her imagination led her
      over a greater extent of the future than that of the young <i>emigre</i>,
      who was merely following one of the many impulses of his life as a man;
      whereas Marie was considering a lifetime, thinking to make it beautiful,
      and to fill it with happiness and with grand and noble sentiments. Happy
      in such thoughts, more in love with her ideal than with the actual
      reality, with the future rather than with the present, she desired now to
      return upon her steps so as to better establish her power. In this she
      acted instinctively, as all women act. Having agreed with her soul that
      she would give herself wholly up, she wished&mdash;if we may so express it&mdash;to
      dispute every fragment of the gift; she longed to take back from the past
      all her words and looks and acts and make them more in harmony with the
      dignity of a woman beloved. Her eyes at times expressed a sort of terror
      as she thought of the interview just over, in which she had shown herself
      aggressive. But as she watched the face before her, instinct with power,
      and felt that a being so strong must also be generous, she glowed at the
      thought that her part in life would be nobler than that of most women,
      inasmuch as her lover was a man of character, a man condemned to death,
      who had come to risk his life in making war against the Republic. The
      thought of occupying such a soul to the exclusion of all rivals gave a new
      aspect to many matters. Between the moment, only five hours earlier, when
      she composed her face and toned her voice to allure the young man, and the
      present moment, when she was able to convulse him with a look, there was
      all the difference to her between a dead world and a living one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the condition of soul in which Mademoiselle de Verneuil now existed
      external life seemed to her a species of phantasmagoria. The carriage
      passed through villages and valleys and mounted hills which left no
      impressions on her mind. They reached Mayenne; the soldiers of the escort
      were changed; Merle spoke to her; she replied; they crossed the whole town
      and were again in the open country; but the faces, houses, streets,
      landscape, men, swept past her like the figments of a dream. Night came,
      and Marie was travelling beneath a diamond sky, wrapped in soft light, and
      yet she was not aware that darkness had succeeded day; that Mayenne was
      passed; that Fougeres was near; she knew not even where she was going.
      That she should part in a few hours from the man she had chosen, and who,
      she believed, had chosen her, was not for her a possibility. Love is the
      only passion which looks to neither past nor future. Occasionally her
      thoughts escaped in broken words, in phrases devoid of meaning, though to
      her lover&rsquo;s ears they sounded like promises of love. To the two witnesses
      of this birth of passion she seemed to be rushing onward with fearful
      rapidity. Francine knew Marie as well as Madame du Gua knew the marquis,
      and their experience of the past made them await in silence some terrible
      finale. It was, indeed, not long before the end came to the drama which
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil had called, without perhaps imagining the truth
      of her words, a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the travellers were about three miles beyond Mayenne they heard a
      horseman riding after them with great rapidity. When he reached the
      carriage he leaned towards it to look at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who
      recognized Corentin. That offensive personage made her a sign of
      intelligence, the familiarity of which was deeply mortifying; then he
      turned away, after chilling her to the bone with a look full of some base
      meaning. The young <i>emigre</i> seemed painfully affected by this
      circumstance, which did not escape the notice of his pretended mother; but
      Marie softly touched him, seeming by her eyes to take refuge in his heart
      as thought it were her only haven. His brow cleared at this proof of the
      full extent of his mistress&rsquo;s attachment, coming to him as it were by
      accident. An inexplicable fear seemed to have overcome her coyness, and
      her love was visible for a moment without a veil. Unfortunately for both
      of them, Madame du Gua saw it all; like a miser who gives a feast, she
      seemed to count the morsels and begrudge the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in their happiness the lovers arrived, without any consciousness
      of the distance they had traversed, at that part of the road which passed
      through the valley of Ernee. There Francine noticed and showed to her
      companions a number of strange forms which seemed to move like shadows
      among the trees and gorse that surrounded the fields. When the carriage
      came within range of these shadows a volley of musketry, the balls of
      which whistled above their heads, warned the travellers that the shadows
      were realities. The escort had fallen into a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Merle now keenly regretted having adopted Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil&rsquo;s idea that a rapid journey by night would be a safe one,&mdash;an
      error which had led him to reduce his escort from Mayenne to sixty men. He
      at once, under Gerard&rsquo;s orders, divided his little troop into two columns,
      one on each side of the road, which the two officers marched at a quick
      step among the gorse hedges, eager to meet the assailants, though ignorant
      of their number. The Blues beat the thick bushes right and left with rash
      intrepidity, and replied to the Chouans with a steady fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s first impulse was to jump from the carriage and
      run back along the road until she was out of sight of the battle; but
      ashamed of her fears, and moved by the feeling which impels us all to act
      nobly under the eyes of those we love, she presently stood still,
      endeavoring to watch the combat coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis followed her, took her hand, and placed it on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;but now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then her terrified maid cried out: &ldquo;Marie, take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as she said the words, Francine, who was springing from the carriage,
      felt herself grasped by a strong hand. The sudden weight of that enormous
      hand made her shriek violently; she turned, and was instantly silenced on
      recognizing Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice I owe to chance,&rdquo; said the marquis to Mademoiselle de Verneuil,
      &ldquo;the revelation of the sweetest secrets of the heart. Thanks to Francine I
      now know you bear the gracious name of Marie,&mdash;Marie, the name I have
      invoked in my distresses,&mdash;Marie, a name I shall henceforth speak in
      joy, and never without sacrifice, mingling religion and love. There can be
      no wrong where prayer and love go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clasped hands, looked silently into each other&rsquo;s eyes, and the excess
      of their emotion took away from them the power to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger for <i>the rest of you</i>,&rdquo; Marche-a-Terre was saying
      roughly to Francine, giving to his hoarse and guttural voice a reproachful
      tone, and emphasizing his last words in a way to stupefy the innocent
      peasant-girl. For the first time in her life she saw ferocity in that
      face. The moonlight seemed to heighten the effect of it. The savage
      Breton, holding his cap in one hand and his heavy carbine in the other,
      dumpy and thickset as a gnome, and bathed in that white light the shadows
      of which give such fantastic aspects to forms, seemed to belong more to a
      world of goblins than to reality. This apparition and its tone of reproach
      came upon Francine with the suddenness of a phantom. He turned rapidly to
      Madame du Gua, with whom he exchanged a few eager words, which Francine,
      who had somewhat forgotten the dialect of Lower Brittany, did not
      understand. The lady seemed to be giving him a series of orders. The short
      conference ended by an imperious gesture of the lady&rsquo;s hand pointing out
      to the Chouan the lovers standing a little distance apart. Before obeying,
      Marche-a-Terre glanced at Francine whom he seemed to pity; he wished to
      speak to her, and the girl was aware that his silence was compulsory. The
      rough and sunburnt skin of his forehead wrinkled, and his eyebrows were
      drawn violently together. Did he think of disobeying a renewed order to
      kill Mademoiselle de Verneuil? The contortion of his face made him all the
      more hideous to Madame du Gua, but to Francine the flash of his eye seemed
      almost gentle, for it taught her to feel intuitively that the violence of
      his savage nature would yield to her will as a woman, and that she
      reigned, next to God, in that rough heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers were interrupted in their tender interview by Madame du Gua,
      who ran up to Marie with a cry, and pulled her away as though some danger
      threatened her. Her real object however, was to enable a member of the
      royalist committee of Alencon, whom she saw approaching them, to speak
      privately to the Gars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of the girl you met at the hotel in Alencon; she will betray you,&rdquo;
       said the Chevalier de Valois, in the young man&rsquo;s ear; and immediately he
      and his little Breton horse disappeared among the bushes from which he had
      issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firing was heavy at that moment, but the combatants did not come to
      close quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adjutant,&rdquo; said Clef-des-Coeurs, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it a sham attack, to capture our
      travellers and get a ransom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil is in it, but I believe you are right,&rdquo; replied Gerard, darting
      back towards the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Chouan fire slackened, for, in truth, the whole object of
      the skirmish was to give the chevalier an opportunity to utter his warning
      to the Gars. Merle, who saw the enemy disappearing across the hedges,
      thought best not to follow them nor to enter upon a fight that was
      uselessly dangerous. Gerard ordered the escort to take its former position
      on the road, and the convoy was again in motion without the loss of a
      single man. The captain offered his hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil to
      replace her in the coach, for the young nobleman stood motionless, as if
      thunderstruck. Marie, amazed at his attitude, got into the carriage alone
      without accepting the politeness of the Republican; she turned her head
      towards her lover, saw him still motionless, and was stupefied at the
      sudden change which had evidently come over him. The young man slowly
      returned, his whole manner betraying deep disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not right?&rdquo; said Madame du Gua in his ear, as she led him to the
      coach. &ldquo;We have fallen into the hands of a creature who is trafficking for
      your head; but since she is such a fool as to have fallen in love with
      you, for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t behave like a boy; pretend to love her at
      least till we reach La Vivetiere; once there&mdash;But,&rdquo; she thought to
      herself, seeing the young man take his place with a dazed air, as if
      bewildered, &ldquo;can it be that he already loves her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coach rolled on over the sandy road. To Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s
      eyes all seemed changed. Death was gliding beside her love. Perhaps it was
      only fancy, but, to a woman who loves, fancy is as vivid as reality.
      Francine, who had clearly understood from Marche-a-Terre&rsquo;s glance that
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s fate, over which she had commanded him to
      watch, was in other hands than his, looked pale and haggard, and could
      scarcely restrain her tears when her mistress spoke to her. To her eyes
      Madame du Gua&rsquo;s female malignancy was scarcely concealed by her
      treacherous smiles, and the sudden changes which her obsequious attentions
      to Mademoiselle de Verneuil made in her manners, voice, and expression was
      of a nature to frighten a watchful observer. Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      herself shuddered instinctively, asking herself, &ldquo;Why should I fear? She
      is his mother.&rdquo; Then she trembled in every limb as the thought crossed her
      mind, &ldquo;Is she really his mother?&rdquo; An abyss suddenly opened before her, and
      she cast a look upon the mother and son, which finally enlightened her.
      &ldquo;That woman loves him!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But why has she begun these
      attentions after showing me such coolness? Am I lost? or&mdash;is she
      afraid of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for the young man, he was flushed and pale by turns; but he kept a
      quiet attitude and lowered his eyes to conceal the emotions which agitated
      him. The graceful curve of his lips was lost in their close compression,
      and his skin turned yellow under the struggle of his stormy thoughts.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was unable to decide whether any love for her
      remained in his evident anger. The road, flanked by woods at this
      particular point, became darker and more gloomy, and the obscurity
      prevented the eyes of the silent travellers from questioning each other.
      The sighing of the wind, the rustling of the trees, the measured step of
      the escort, gave that almost solemn character to the scene which quickens
      the pulses. Mademoiselle de Verneuil could not long try in vain to
      discover the reason of this change. The recollection of Corentin came to
      her like a flash, and reminded her suddenly of her real destiny. For the
      first time since the morning she reflected seriously on her position.
      Until then she had yielded herself up to the delight of loving, without a
      thought of the past or of the future. Unable to bear the agony of her
      mind, she sought, with the patience of love, to obtain a look from the
      young man&rsquo;s eyes, and when she did so her paleness and the quiver in her
      face had so penetrating an influence over him that he wavered; but the
      softening was momentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, mademoiselle?&rdquo; he said, but his voice had no gentleness; the
      very question, the look, the gesture, all served to convince her that the
      events of this day belonged to a mirage of the soul which was fast
      disappearing like mists before the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I ill?&rdquo; she replied, with a forced laugh. &ldquo;I was going to ask you the
      same question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed you understood each other,&rdquo; remarked Madame du Gua with
      specious kindliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the young man nor Mademoiselle de Verneuil replied. The girl,
      doubly insulted, was angered at feeling her powerful beauty powerless. She
      knew she could discover the cause of the present situation the moment she
      chose to do so; but, for the first time, perhaps, a woman recoiled before
      a secret. Human life is sadly fertile in situations where, as a result of
      either too much meditation or of some catastrophe, our thoughts seem to
      hold to nothing; they have no substance, no point of departure, and the
      present has no hooks by which to hold to the past or fasten on the future.
      This was Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s condition at the present moment.
      Leaning back in the carriage, she sat there like an uprooted shrub. Silent
      and suffering, she looked at no one, wrapped herself in her grief, and
      buried herself so completely in the unseen world, the refuge of the
      miserable, that she saw nothing around her. Crows crossed the road in the
      air above them cawing, but although, like all strong hearts, hers had a
      superstitious corner, she paid no attention to the omen. The party
      travelled on in silence. &ldquo;Already parted?&rdquo; Mademoiselle de Verneuil was
      saying to herself. &ldquo;Yet no one about us has uttered one word. Could it be
      Corentin? It is not his interest to speak. Who can have come to this spot
      and accused me? Just loved, and already abandoned! I sow attraction, and I
      reap contempt. Is it my perpetual fate to see happiness and ever lose it?&rdquo;
       Pangs hitherto unknown to her wrung her heart, for she now loved truly and
      for the first time. Yet she had not so wholly delivered herself to her
      lover that she could not take refuge from her pain in the natural pride
      and dignity of a young and beautiful woman. The secret of her love&mdash;a
      secret often kept by women under torture itself&mdash;had not escaped her
      lips. Presently she rose from her reclining attitude, ashamed that she had
      shown her passion by her silent sufferings; she shook her head with a
      light-hearted action, and showed a face, or rather a mask, that was gay
      and smiling, then she raised her voice to disguise the quiver of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; she said to Captain Merle, who kept himself at a certain
      distance from the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six miles from Fougeres, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon be there, shall we not?&rdquo; she went on, to encourage a
      conversation in which she might show some preference for the young
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Breton mile,&rdquo; said Merle much delighted, &ldquo;has the disadvantage of never
      ending; when you are at the top of one hill you see a valley and another
      hill. When you reach the summit of the slope we are now ascending you will
      see the plateau of Mont Pelerine in the distance. Let us hope the Chouans
      won&rsquo;t take their revenge there. Now, in going up hill and going down hill
      one doesn&rsquo;t make much headway. From La Pelerine you will still see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young <i>emigre</i> made a movement at the name which Marie alone
      noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is La Pelerine?&rdquo; she asked hastily, interrupting the captain&rsquo;s
      description of Breton topography.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the summit of a mountain,&rdquo; said Merle, &ldquo;which gives its name to the
      Maine valley through which we shall presently pass. It separates this
      valley from that of Couesnon, at the end of which is the town of Fougeres,
      the chief town in Brittany. We had a fight there last Vendemiaire with the
      Gars and his brigands. We were escorting Breton conscripts, who meant to
      kill us sooner than leave their own land; but Hulot is a rough Christian,
      and he gave them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the Gars?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What sort of man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her keen, malicious eyes never left the so-called vicomte&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied Merle, nettled at being always interrupted,
      &ldquo;he is so like citizen du Gua, that if your friend did not wear the
      uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique I could swear it was he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil looked fixedly at the cold, impassible young man
      who had scorned her, but she saw nothing in him that betrayed the
      slightest feeling of alarm. She warned him by a bitter smile that she had
      now discovered the secret so treacherously kept; then in a jesting voice,
      her nostrils dilating with pleasure, and her head so turned that she could
      watch the young man and yet see Merle, she said to the Republican: &ldquo;That
      new leader gives a great deal of anxiety to the First Consul. He is very
      daring, they say; but he has the weakness of rushing headlong into
      adventures, especially with women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are counting on that to get even with him,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;If we
      catch him for only an hour we shall put a bullet in his head. He&rsquo;ll do the
      same to us if he meets us, so <i>par pari</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the <i>emigre</i>, &ldquo;we have nothing to fear. Your soldiers
      cannot go as far as La Pelerine, they are tired, and, if you consent, we
      can all rest a short distance from here. My mother stops at La Vivetiere,
      the road to which turns off a few rods farther on. These ladies might like
      to stop there too; they must be tired with their long drive from Alencon
      without resting; and as mademoiselle,&rdquo; he added, with forced politeness,
      &ldquo;has had the generosity to give safety as well as pleasure to our journey,
      perhaps she will deign to accept a supper from my mother; and I think,
      captain,&rdquo; he added, addressing Merle, &ldquo;the times are not so bad but what
      we can find a barrel of cider for your men. The Gars can&rsquo;t have taken all,
      at least my mother thinks not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, interrupting him in a tone
      of irony, and making no reply to his invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my age seem more improbable to you this evening, mademoiselle?&rdquo; said
      Madame du Gua. &ldquo;Unfortunately I was married very young, and my son was
      born when I was fifteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not mistaken, madame?&mdash;when you were thirty, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua turned livid as she swallowed the sarcasm. She would have
      liked to revenge herself on the spot, but was forced to smile, for she was
      determined at any cost, even that of insult, to discover the nature of the
      feelings that actuated the young girl; she therefore pretended not to have
      understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chouans have never had a more cruel leader than the Gars, if we are
      to believe the stories about him,&rdquo; she said, addressing herself vaguely to
      both Francine and her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for cruel, I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil;
      &ldquo;he knows how to lie, but he seems rather credulous himself. The leader of
      a party ought not to be the plaything of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; asked the <i>emigre</i>, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, with a disdainful glance, &ldquo;but I thought I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle, he&rsquo;s a <i>malin</i>, yes a <i>malin</i>,&rdquo; said Captain
      Merle, shaking his head and giving with an expressive gesture the peculiar
      meaning to the word which it had in those days but has since lost. &ldquo;Those
      old families do sometimes send out vigorous shoots. He has just returned
      from a country where, they say, the <i>ci-devants</i> didn&rsquo;t find life too
      easy, and men ripen like medlars in the straw. If that fellow is really
      clever he can lead us a pretty dance. He has already formed companies of
      light infantry who oppose our troops and neutralize the efforts of the
      government. If we burn a royalist village he burns two of ours. He can
      hold an immense tract of country and force us to spread out our men at the
      very moment when we want them on one spot. Oh, he knows what he is about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is cutting his country&rsquo;s throat,&rdquo; said Gerard in a loud voice,
      interrupting the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the <i>emigre</i>, &ldquo;if his death would deliver the nation,
      why don&rsquo;t you catch him and shoot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he tried to look into the depths of Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s
      soul, and one of those voiceless scenes the dramatic vividness and
      fleeting sagacity of which cannot be reproduced in language passed between
      them in a flash. Danger is always interesting. The worst criminal
      threatened with death excites pity. Though Mademoiselle de Verneuil was
      now certain that the lover who had cast her off was this very leader of
      the Chouans, she was not ready to verify her suspicions by giving him up;
      she had quite another curiosity to satisfy. She preferred to doubt or to
      believe as her passion led her, and she now began deliberately to play
      with peril. Her eyes, full of scornful meaning, bade the young chief
      notice the soldiers of the escort; by thus presenting to his mind
      triumphantly an image of his danger she made him feel that his life
      depended on a word from her, and her lips seemed to quiver on the verge of
      pronouncing it. Like an American Indian, she watched every muscle of the
      face of her enemy, tied, as it were, to the stake, while she brandished
      her tomahawk gracefully, enjoying a revenge that was still innocent, and
      torturing like a mistress who still loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had a son like yours, madame,&rdquo; she said to Madame du Gua, who was
      visibly frightened, &ldquo;I should wear mourning from the day when I had
      yielded him to danger; I should know no peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer was made to this speech. She turned her head repeatedly to the
      escort and then suddenly to Madame du Gua, without detecting the slightest
      secret signal between the lady and the Gars which might have confirmed her
      suspicions on the nature of their intimacy, which she longed to doubt. The
      young chief calmly smiled, and bore without flinching the scrutiny she
      forced him to undergo; his attitude and the expression of his face were
      those of a man indifferent to danger; he even seemed to say at times:
      &ldquo;This is your chance to avenge your wounded vanity&mdash;take it! I have
      no desire to lessen my contempt for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil began to study the young man from the
      vantage-ground of her position with coolness and dignity; at the bottom of
      her heart she admired his courage and tranquillity. Happy in discovering
      that the man she loved bore an ancient title (the distinctions of which
      please every woman), she also found pleasure in meeting him in their
      present situation, where, as champion of a cause ennobled by misfortune,
      he was fighting with all the faculties of a strong soul against a Republic
      that was constantly victorious. She rejoiced to see him brought face to
      face with danger, and still displaying the courage and bravery so powerful
      on a woman&rsquo;s heart; again and again she put him to the test, obeying
      perhaps the instinct which induces a woman to play with her victim as a
      cat plays with a mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By virtue of what law do you put the Chouans to death?&rdquo; she said to
      Merle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of the 14th of last Fructidor, which outlaws the insurgent
      departments and proclaims martial law,&rdquo; replied the Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why I have the honor to attract your eyes?&rdquo; she said presently
      to the young chief, who was attentively watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of a feeling which a man of honor cannot express to any woman, no
      matter who she is,&rdquo; replied the Marquis de Montauran, in a low voice,
      bending down to her. &ldquo;We live in times,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;when women do the
      work of the executioner and wield the axe with even better effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at de Montauran fixedly; then, delighted to be attacked by the
      man whose life she held in her hands, she said in a low voice, smiling
      softly: &ldquo;Your head is a very poor one; the executioner does not want it; I
      shall keep it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis looked at the inexplicable girl, whose love had overcome all,
      even insult, and who now avenged herself by forgiving that which women are
      said never to forgive. His eyes grew less stern, less cold; a look of
      sadness came upon his face. His love was stronger than he suspected.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, satisfied with these faint signs of a desired
      reconciliation, glanced at him tenderly, with a smile that was like a
      kiss; then she leaned back once more in the carriage, determined not to
      risk the future of this happy drama, believing she had assured it with her
      smile. She was so beautiful! She knew so well how to conquer all obstacles
      to love! She was so accustomed to take all risks and push on at all
      hazards! She loved the unexpected, and the tumults of life&mdash;why
      should she fear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the carriage, under the young chief&rsquo;s directions, left the
      highway and took a road cut between banks planted with apple-trees, more
      like a ditch than a roadway, which led to La Vivetiere. The carriage now
      advanced rapidly, leaving the escort to follow slowly towards the
      manor-house, the gray roofs of which appeared and disappeared among the
      trees. Some of the men lingered on the way to knock the stiff clay of the
      road-bed from their shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is devilishly like the road to Paradise,&rdquo; remarked Beau-Pied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the impatience of the postilion, Mademoiselle de Verneuil soon
      saw the chateau of La Vivetiere. This house, standing at the end of a sort
      of promontory, was protected and surrounded by two deep lakelets, and
      could be reached only by a narrow causeway. That part of the little
      peninsula on which the house and gardens were placed was still further
      protected by a moat filled with water from the two lakes which it
      connected. The house really stood on an island that was well-nigh
      impregnable,&mdash;an invaluable retreat for a chieftain, who could be
      surprised there only by treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil put her head out of the carriage as she heard the
      rusty hinges of the great gates open to give entrance to an arched portal
      which had been much injured during the late war. The gloomy colors of the
      scene which met her eyes almost extinguished the thoughts of love and
      coquetry in which she had been indulging. The carriage entered a large
      courtyard that was nearly square, bordered on each side by the steep banks
      of the lakelets. Those sterile shores, washed by water, which was covered
      with large green patches, had no other ornament than aquatic trees devoid
      of foliage, the twisted trunks and hoary heads of which, rising from the
      reeds and rushes, gave them a certain grotesque likeness to gigantic
      marmosets. These ugly growths seemed to waken and talk to each other when
      the frogs deserted them with much croaking, and the water-fowl, startled
      by the sound of the wheels, flew low upon the surface of the pools. The
      courtyard, full of rank and seeded grasses, reeds, and shrubs, either
      dwarf or parasite, excluded all impression of order or of splendor. The
      house appeared to have been long abandoned. The roof seemed to bend
      beneath the weight of the various vegetations which grew upon it. The
      walls, though built of the smooth, slaty stone which abounds in that
      region, showed many rifts and chinks where ivy had fastened its rootlets.
      Two main buildings, joined at the angle by a tall tower which faced the
      lake, formed the whole of the chateau, the doors and swinging, rotten
      shutters, rusty balustrades, and broken windows of which seemed ready to
      fall at the first tempest. The north wind whistled through these ruins, to
      which the moon, with her indefinite light, gave the character and outline
      of a great spectre. But the colors of those gray-blue granites, mingling
      with the black and tawny schists, must have been seen in order to
      understand how vividly a spectral image was suggested by the empty and
      gloomy carcass of the building. Its disjointed stones and paneless
      windows, the battered tower and broken roofs gave it the aspect of a
      skeleton; the birds of prey which flew from it, shrieking, added another
      feature to this vague resemblance. A few tall pine-trees standing behind
      the house waved their dark foliage above the roof, and several yews cut
      into formal shapes at the angles of the building, festooned it gloomily
      like the ornaments on a hearse. The style of the doors, the coarseness of
      the decorations, the want of harmony in the architecture, were all
      characteristic of the feudal manors of which Brittany was proud; perhaps
      justly proud, for they maintained upon that Gaelic ground a species of
      monumental history of the nebulous period which preceded the establishment
      of the French monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, to whose imagination the word &ldquo;chateau&rdquo; brought
      none but its conventional ideas, was affected by the funereal aspect of
      the scene. She sprang from the carriage and stood apart gazing at in
      terror, and debating within herself what action she ought to take.
      Francine heard Madame du Gua give a sigh of relief as she felt herself in
      safety beyond reach of the Blues; an exclamation escaped her when the
      gates were closed, and she saw the carriage and its occupants within the
      walls of this natural fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis de Montauran turned hastily to Mademoiselle de Verneuil,
      divining the thoughts that crowded in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This chateau,&rdquo; he said, rather sadly, &ldquo;was ruined by the war, just as my
      plans for our happiness have been ruined by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ruined?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you indeed &lsquo;beautiful, brilliant, and of noble birth&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked
      ironically, repeating the words she had herself used in their former
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has told you to the contrary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, in whom I put faith; who care for my safety and are on the watch
      against treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a sarcastic tone. &ldquo;Have you forgotten Hulot
      and Alencon already? You have no memory,&mdash;a dangerous defect in the
      leader of a party. But if friends,&rdquo; she added, with increased sarcasm,
      &ldquo;are so all-powerful in your heart, keep your friends. Nothing is
      comparable to the joys of friendship. Adieu; neither I nor the soldiers of
      the Republic will stop here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards the gateway with a look of wounded pride and scorn, and
      her motions as she did so displayed a dignity and also a despair which
      changed in an instant the thoughts of the young man; he felt that the cost
      of relinquishing his desires was too great, and he gave himself up
      deliberately to imprudence and credulity. He loved; and the lovers had no
      desire now to quarrel with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say but one word and I will believe you,&rdquo; he said, in a supplicating
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word?&rdquo; she answered, closing her lips tightly, &ldquo;not a single word;
      not even a gesture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, be angry with me,&rdquo; he entreated, trying to take the hand she
      withheld from him,&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if you dare to be angry with the leader
      of the rebels, who is now as sad and distrustful as he was lately happy
      and confiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie gave him a look that was far from angry, and he added: &ldquo;You have my
      secret, but I have not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The alabaster brow appeared to darken at these words; she cast a look of
      annoyance on the young chieftain, and answered, hastily: &ldquo;Tell you my
      secret? Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In love every word, every glance has the eloquence of the moment; but on
      this occasion Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s exclamation revealed nothing,
      and, clever as Montauran might be, its secret was impenetrable to him,
      though the tones of her voice betrayed some extraordinary and unusual
      emotion which piqued his curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a singular way of dispelling suspicion,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still suspect me?&rdquo; she replied, looking him in the eye, as if to
      say, &ldquo;What rights have you over me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the young man, in a voice that was submissive and yet
      firm, &ldquo;the authority you exercise over Republican troops, this escort&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that reminds me! My escort and I,&rdquo; she asked, in a slightly satirical
      tone, &ldquo;your protectors, in short,&mdash;will they be safe here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on the word of a gentleman. Whoever you be, you and your party have
      nothing to fear in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The promise was made with so loyal and generous an air and manner that
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil felt absolutely secure as to the safety of the
      Republican soldiers. She was about to speak when Madame du Gua&rsquo;s approach
      silenced her. That lady had either overheard or guessed part of their
      conversation, and was filled with anxiety at no longer perceiving any
      signs of animosity between them. As soon as the marquis caught sight of
      her, he offered his hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil and led her hastily
      towards the house, as if to escape an undesired companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in their way,&rdquo; thought Madame du Gua, remaining where she was. She
      watched the lovers walking slowly towards the portico, where they stopped,
      as if satisfied to have placed some distance between themselves and her.
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am in their way,&rdquo; she repeated, speaking to herself; &ldquo;but
      before long that creature will not be in mine; the lake, God willing,
      shall have her. I&rsquo;ll help him keep his word as a gentleman; once under the
      water, she has nothing to fear,&mdash;what can be safer than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking fixedly at the still mirror of the little lake to the
      right when suddenly she heard a rustling among the rushes and saw in the
      moonlight the face of Marche-a-Terre rising behind the gnarled trunk of an
      old willow. None but those who knew the Chouan well could have
      distinguished him from the tangle of branches of which he seemed a part.
      Madame du Gua looked about her with some distrust; she saw the postilion
      leading his horses to a stable in the wing of the chateau which was
      opposite to the bank where Marche-a-Terre was hiding; Francine, with her
      back to her, was going towards the two lovers, who at that moment had
      forgotten the whole earth. Madame du Gua, with a finger on her lip to
      demand silence, walked towards the Chouan, who guessed rather than heard
      her question, &ldquo;How many of you are here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are sixty-five; I counted them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the savage, with sullen satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attentive to all Francine&rsquo;s movements, the Chouan disappeared behind the
      willow, as he saw her turn to look for the enemy over whom she was keeping
      an instinctive watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six or eight persons, attracted by the noise of the carriage-wheels, came
      out on the portico, shouting: &ldquo;It is the Gars! it is he; here he is!&rdquo; On
      this several other men ran out, and their coming interrupted the lovers.
      The Marquis de Montauran went hastily up to them, making an imperative
      gesture for silence, and pointing to the farther end of the causeway,
      where the Republican escort was just appearing. At the sight of the
      well-known blue uniforms with red facings, and the glittering bayonets,
      the amazed conspirators called out hastily, &ldquo;You have surely not betrayed
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had, I should not warn you,&rdquo; said the marquis, smiling bitterly.
      &ldquo;Those Blues,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, &ldquo;are the escort of this young
      lady, whose generosity has delivered us, almost miraculously, from a
      danger we were in at Alencon. I will tell you about it later. Mademoiselle
      and her escort are here in safety, on my word as a gentleman, and we must
      all receive them as friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua and Francine were now on the portico; the marquis offered
      his hand to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, the group of gentlemen parted in two
      lines to allow them to pass, endeavoring, as they did so, to catch sight
      of the young lady&rsquo;s features; for Madame du Gua, who was following behind,
      excited their curiosity by secret signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil saw, with surprise, that a large table was set in
      the first hall, for about twenty guests. The dining-room opened into a
      vast salon, where the whole party were presently assembled. These rooms
      were in keeping with the dilapidated appearance of the outside of the
      house. The walnut panels, polished by age, but rough and coarse in design
      and badly executed, were loose in their places and ready to fall. Their
      dingy color added to the gloom of these apartments, which were barren of
      curtains and mirrors; a few venerable bits of furniture in the last stages
      of decay alone remained, and harmonized with the general destruction.
      Marie noticed maps and plans stretched out upon long tables, and in the
      corners of the room a quantity of weapons and stacked carbines. These
      things bore witness, though she did not know it, to an important
      conference between the leaders of the Vendeans and those of the Chouans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis led Mademoiselle de Verneuil to a large and worm-eaten
      armchair placed beside the fireplace; Francine followed and stood behind
      her mistress, leaning on the back of that ancient bit of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will allow me for a moment to play the part of master of the house,&rdquo;
       he said, leaving the two women and mingling with the groups of his other
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine saw the gentlemen hasten, after a few words from Montauran, to
      hide their weapons, maps, and whatever else might arouse the suspicions of
      the Republican officers. Some took off their broad leather belts
      containing pistols and hunting-knives. The marquis requested them to show
      the utmost prudence, and went himself to see to the reception of the
      troublesome guests whom fate had bestowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who had raised her feet to the fire and was now
      warming them, did not turn her head as Montauran left the room, thus
      disappointing those present, who were anxious to see her. Francine alone
      saw the change produced upon the company by the departure of the young
      chief. The gentlemen gathered hastily round Madame du Gua, and during a
      conversation carried on in an undertone between them, they all turned
      several times to look curiously at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Montauran,&rdquo; Madame du Gua said to them; &ldquo;he has fallen in love
      with that worthless girl, and, as you can easily understand, he thinks all
      my warnings selfish. Our friends in Paris, Messieurs de Valois and
      d&rsquo;Esgrignon, have warned him of a trap set for him by throwing some such
      creature at his head; but in spite of this he allows himself to be fooled
      by the first woman he meets,&mdash;a girl who, if my information is
      correct, has stolen a great name only to disgrace it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker, in whom our readers have already recognized the lady who
      instigated the attack on the &ldquo;turgotine,&rdquo; may be allowed to keep the name
      which she used to escape the dangers that threatened her in Alencon. The
      publication of her real name would only mortify a noble family already
      deeply afflicted at the misconduct of this woman; whose history, by the
      bye, has already been given on another scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curiosity manifested by the company of men soon became impertinent and
      almost hostile. A few harsh words reached Francine&rsquo;s ear, and after a word
      said to her mistress the girl retreated into the embrasure of a window.
      Marie rose, turned towards the insolent group, and gave them a look full
      of dignity and even disdain. Her beauty, the elegance of her manners, and
      her pride changed the behavior of her enemies, and won her the flattering
      murmur which escaped their lips. Two or three men, whose outward
      appearance seemed to denote the habits of polite society and the gallantry
      acquired in courts, came towards her; but her propriety of demeanor forced
      them to respect her, and none dared speak to her; so that, instead of
      being herself arraigned by the company, it was she who appeared to judge
      of them. These chiefs of a war undertaken for God and the king bore very
      little resemblance to the portraits her fancy had drawn of them. The
      struggle, really great in itself, shrank to mean proportions as she
      observed these provincial noblemen, all, with one or two vigorous
      exceptions, devoid of significance and virility. Having made to herself a
      poem of such heroes, Marie suddenly awakened to the truth. Their faces
      expressed to her eyes more a love of scheming than a love of glory;
      self-interest had evidently put arms into their hands. Still, it must be
      said that these men did become heroic when brought into action. The loss
      of her illusions made Mademoiselle de Verneuil unjust, and prevented her
      from recognizing the real devotion which rendered several of these men
      remarkable. It is true that most of those now present were commonplace. A
      few original and marked faces appeared among them, but even these were
      belittled by the artificiality and the etiquette of aristocracy. If Marie
      generously granted intellect and perception to the latter, she also
      discerned in them a total absence of the simplicity, the grandeur, to
      which she had been accustomed among the triumphant men of the Republic.
      This nocturnal assemblage in the old ruined castle made her smile; the
      scene seemed symbolic of the monarchy. But the thought came to her with
      delight that the marquis at least played a noble part among these men,
      whose only remaining merit in her eyes was devotion to a lost cause. She
      pictured her lover&rsquo;s face upon the background of this company, rejoicing
      to see it stand forth among those paltry and puny figures who were but the
      instruments of his great designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps of the marquis were heard in the adjoining room. Instantly
      the company separated into little groups and the whisperings ceased. Like
      schoolboys who have plotted mischief in the master&rsquo;s absence, they
      hurriedly became silent and orderly. Montauran entered. Marie had the
      happiness of admiring him among his fellows, of whom he was the youngest,
      the handsomest, and the chief. Like a king in his court, he went from
      group to group, distributing looks and nods and words of encouragement or
      warning, with pressure of the hands and smiles; doing his duty as leader
      of a party with a grace and self-possession hardly to be expected in the
      young man whom Marie had so lately accused of heedlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the marquis put an end to the open curiosity bestowed on
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, but Madame du Gua&rsquo;s scandalous suggestions bore
      fruit. The Baron du Guenic, familiarly called &ldquo;l&rsquo;Intime,&rdquo; who by rank and
      name had the best right among those present to treat Montauran familiarly,
      took the young leader by the arm and led him apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear marquis,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we are much disturbed at seeing you on the
      point of committing an amazing folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where that girl comes from, who she is, and what her schemes
      about you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, my dear Intime; between you and me my fancy for
      her will be over to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but suppose that creature betrays you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer that when you tell me why she has not done it already,&rdquo; said
      Montauran, assuming with a laugh an air of conceit. &ldquo;My dear fellow, look
      at that charming girl, watch her manners, and dare to tell me she is not a
      woman of distinction. If she gave you a few favorable looks wouldn&rsquo;t you
      feel at the bottom of your soul a respect for her? A certain lady has
      prejudiced you. I will tell you this: if she were the lost creature our
      friends are trying to make her out, I would, after what she and I have
      said to each other, kill her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua, joining them, &ldquo;that Fouche is fool
      enough to send you a common prostitute out of the streets? He has provided
      seductions according to your deserts. You may choose to be blind, but your
      friends are keeping their eyes open to protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied the Gars, his eyes flashing with anger, &ldquo;be warned; take
      no steps against that lady, nor against her escort; if you do, nothing
      shall save you from my vengeance. I choose that Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      is to be treated with the utmost respect, and as a lady belonging to my
      family. We are, I believe, related to the de Verneuils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The opposition the marquis was made to feel produced the usual effect of
      such obstacles on all young men. Though he had, apparently, treated
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil rather lightly, and left it to be supposed that
      his passion for her was a mere caprice, he now, from a feeling of pride,
      made immense strides in his relation to her. By openly protecting her, his
      honor became concerned in compelling respect to her person; and he went
      from group to group assuring his friends, in the tone of a man whom it was
      dangerous to contradict, that the lady was really Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil. The doubts and gossip ceased at once. As soon as Montauran felt
      that harmony was restored and anxiety allayed, he returned to his mistress
      eagerly, saying in a low voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those mischievous people have robbed me of an hour&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have come back to me,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;I warn you that
      I am inquisitive; therefore you must not get tired of my questions. Tell
      me, in the first place, who is that worthy in a green cloth jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the famous Major Brigaut, a man from the Marais, a comrade of the
      late Mercier, called La Vendee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that fat priest with the red face to whom he is talking at this
      moment about me?&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to know what they are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I want to know it? What a useless question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could not tell it without offending you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you allow me to be insulted in your house without avenging me,
      marquis, adieu!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will not stay another moment. I have some
      qualms already about deceiving these poor Republicans, loyal and confiding
      as they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a few hasty steps; the marquis followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Marie, listen to me. On my honor, I have silenced their evil
      speaking, without knowing whether it was false or true. But, placed as I
      am, if friends whom we have in all the ministries in Paris warn me to
      beware of every woman I meet, and assure me that Fouche has employed
      against me a Judith of the streets, it is not unnatural that my best
      friends here should think you too beautiful to be an honest woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the marquis plunged a glance into Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s
      eyes. She colored, and was unable to restrain her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve these insults,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish you really thought me that
      despicable creature and still loved me; then, indeed, I could no longer
      doubt you. I believed in you when you were deceiving me, and you will not
      believe me now when I am true. Let us make an end of this, monsieur,&rdquo; she
      said, frowning, but turning pale as death,&mdash;&ldquo;adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rushed towards the dining-room with a movement of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, my life is yours,&rdquo; said the young marquis in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will be generous. Farewell. In coming with you here
      I did not think of my past nor of your future&mdash;I was beside myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot mean that you will leave me now when I offer you my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You offer it in a moment of passion&mdash;of desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer it without regret, and forever,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the room they had left. Hiding his emotions the marquis
      continued the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fat priest whose name you asked is the Abbe Gudin, a Jesuit,
      obstinate enough&mdash;perhaps I ought to say devoted enough,&mdash;to
      remain in France in spite of the decree of 1793, which banished his order.
      He is the firebrand of the war in these regions and a propagandist of the
      religious association called the Sacre-Coeur. Trained to use religion as
      an instrument, he persuades his followers that if they are killed they
      will be brought to life again, and he knows how to rouse their fanaticism
      by shrewd sermons. You see, it is necessary to work upon every man&rsquo;s
      selfish interests to attain a great end. That is the secret of all
      political success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that vigorous, muscular old man, with the repulsive face, who is he?
      I mean the one in the ragged gown of a barrister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrister! he aspires to be considered a brigadier-general. Did you never
      hear of de Longuy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that he!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, horrified. &ldquo;You employ
      such men as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! he&rsquo;ll hear you. Do you see that other man in malignant conversation
      with Madame du Gua?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one in black who looks like a judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one of our go-betweens, La Billardiere, son of a councillor to
      the Breton Parliament, whose real name is something like Flamet; he is in
      close correspondence with the princes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his neighbor? the one who is just putting up his white clay pipe, and
      uses all the fingers of his right hand to snap the box, like a
      countryman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you are right; he was game-keeper to the deceased husband of
      that lady, and now commands one of the companies I send against the
      Republican militia. He and Marche-a-Terre are the two most conscientious
      vassals the king has here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&mdash;who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charette&rsquo;s last mistress,&rdquo; replied the marquis. &ldquo;She wields great
      influence over all these people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she faithful to his memory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all answer the marquis gave a dubious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think well of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very inquisitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is my enemy because she can no longer be my rival,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil, laughing. &ldquo;I forgive her her past errors if she forgives
      mine. Who is that officer with the long moustache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me not to name him; he wants to get rid of the First Consul by
      assassination. Whether he succeeds or not you will hear of him. He is
      certain to become famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have come here to command such men as these!&rdquo; she exclaimed in
      horror. &ldquo;Are <i>they</i> they king&rsquo;s defenders? Where are the gentlemen
      and the great lords?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said the marquis, coolly, &ldquo;they are in all the courts of Europe.
      Who else should win over kings and cabinets and armies to serve the
      Bourbon cause and hurl them at that Republic which threatens monarchies
      and social order with death and destruction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, with generous emotion, &ldquo;be to me henceforth the source
      from which I draw the ideas I must still acquire about your cause&mdash;I
      consent. But let me still remember that you are the only noble who does
      his duty in fighting France with Frenchmen, without the help of
      foreigners. I am a woman; I feel that if my child struck me in anger I
      could forgive him; but if he saw me beaten by a stranger, and consented to
      it, I should regard him as a monster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall remain a Republican,&rdquo; said the marquis, in the ardor produced
      by the generous words which confirmed his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Republican! no, I am that no longer. I could not now respect you if you
      submitted to the First Consul,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But neither do I like to see
      you at the head of men who are pillaging a corner of France, instead of
      making war against the whole Republic. For whom are you fighting? What do
      you expect of a king restored to his throne by your efforts? A woman did
      that great thing once, and the liberated king allowed her to be burned.
      Such men are the anointed of the Lord, and there is danger in meddling
      with sacred things. Let God take care of his own, and place, displace, and
      replace them on their purple seats. But if you have counted the cost, and
      seen the poor return that will come to you, you are tenfold greater in my
      eyes than I thought you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are bewitching. Don&rsquo;t attempt to indoctrinate my followers, or I
      shall be left without a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would let me convert you, only you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we might live
      happily a thousand leagues away from all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men whom you seem to despise,&rdquo; said the marquis, in a graver tone,
      &ldquo;will know how to die when the struggle comes, and all their misdeeds will
      be forgotten. Besides, if my efforts are crowned with some success, the
      laurel leaves of victory will hide all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no one but you who is risking anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken; I am not the only one,&rdquo; he replied, with true modesty.
      &ldquo;See, over there, the new leaders from La Vendee. The first, whom you must
      have heard of as &lsquo;Le Grand Jacques,&rsquo; is the Comte de Fontain; the other is
      La Billardiere, whom I mentioned to you just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten Quiberon, where La Billardiere played so equivocal a
      part?&rdquo; she said, struck by a sudden recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Billardiere took a great deal upon himself. Serving princes is far
      from lying on a bed of roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you make me shudder!&rdquo; cried Marie. &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; she continued, in a
      tone which seemed to indicate some mysterious personal reticence, &ldquo;a
      single instant suffices to destroy illusions and to betray secrets on
      which the life and happiness of many may depend&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, as
      though she feared she had said too much; then she added, in another tone,
      &ldquo;I wish I could be sure that those Republican soldiers were in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be prudent,&rdquo; he said, smiling to disguise his emotion; &ldquo;but say no
      more about your soldiers; have I not answered for their safety on my word
      as a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what right have I to dictate to you? Be my
      master henceforth. Did I not tell you it would drive me to despair to rule
      a slave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; said Major Brigaut, respectfully, interrupting the
      conversation, &ldquo;how long are the Blues to remain here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will leave as soon as they are rested,&rdquo; said Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis looked about the room and noticed the agitation of those
      present. He left Mademoiselle de Verneuil, and his place beside her was
      taken at once by Madame du Gua, whose smiling and treacherous face was in
      no way disconcerted by the young chief&rsquo;s bitter smile. Just then Francine,
      standing by the window, gave a stifled cry. Marie, noticing with amazement
      that the girl left the room, looked at Madame du Gua, and her surprise
      increased as she saw the pallor on the face of her enemy. Anxious to
      discover the meaning of Francine&rsquo;s abrupt departure, she went to the
      window, where Madame du Gua followed her, no doubt to guard against any
      suspicions which might arise in her mind. They returned together to the
      chimney, after each had cast a look upon the shore and the lake,&mdash;Marie
      without seeing anything that could have caused Francine&rsquo;s flight, Madame
      du Gua seeing that which satisfied her she was being obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lake, at the edge of which Marche-a-Terre had shown his head, where
      Madame du Gua had seen him, joined the moat in misty curves, sometimes
      broad as ponds, in other places narrow as the artificial streamlets of a
      park. The steep bank, washed by its waters, lay a few rods from the
      window. Francine, watching on the surface of the water the black lines
      thrown by the willows, noticed, carelessly at first, the uniform trend of
      their branches, caused by a light breeze then prevailing. Suddenly she
      thought she saw against the glassy surface a figure moving with the
      spontaneous and irregular motion of life. The form, vague as it was,
      seemed to her that of a man. At first she attributed what she saw to the
      play of the moonlight upon the foliage, but presently a second head
      appeared, then several others in the distance. The shrubs upon the bank
      were bent and then violently straightened, and Francine saw the long hedge
      undulating like one of those great Indian serpents of fabulous size and
      shape. Here and there, among the gorse and taller brambles, points of
      light could be seen to come and go. The girl&rsquo;s attention redoubled, and
      she thought she recognized the foremost of the dusky figures; indistinct
      as its outlines were, the beating of her heart convinced her it was no
      other than her lover, Marche-a-Terre. Eager to know if this mysterious
      approach meant treachery, she ran to the courtyard. When she reached the
      middle of its grass plot she looked alternately at the two wings of the
      building and along the steep shores, without discovering, on the inhabited
      side of the house, any sign of this silent approach. She listened
      attentively and heard a slight rustling, like that which might be made by
      the footfalls of some wild animal in the silence of the forest. She
      quivered, but did not tremble. Though young and innocent, her anxious
      curiosity suggested a ruse. She saw the coach and slipped into it, putting
      out her head to listen, with the caution of a hare giving ear to the sound
      of the distant hunters. She saw Pille-Miche come out of the stable,
      accompanied by two peasants, all three carrying bales of straw; these they
      spread on the ground in a way to form a long bed of litter before the
      inhabited wing of the house, parallel with the bank, bordered by dwarf
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re spreading straw as if you thought they&rsquo;d sleep here! Enough,
      Pille-Miche, enough!&rdquo; said a low, gruff voice, which Francine recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t they sleep here?&rdquo; returned Pille-Miche with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid the Gars will be angry!&rdquo; he added, too low for Francine to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, in the same tone, &ldquo;we shall have
      killed the Blues anyway. Here&rsquo;s that coach, which you and I had better put
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pille-Miche pulled the carriage by the pole and Marche-a-Terre pushed it
      by one of the wheels with such force that Francine was in the barn and
      about to be locked up before she had time to reflect on her situation.
      Pille-Miche went out to fetch the barrel of cider, which the marquis had
      ordered for the escort; and Marche-a-Terre was passing along the side of
      the coach, to leave the barn and close the door, when he was stopped by a
      hand which caught and held the long hair of his goatskin. He recognized a
      pair of eyes the gentleness of which exercised a power of magnetism over
      him, and he stood stock-still for a moment under their spell. Francine
      sprang from the carriage, and said, in the nervous tone of an excited
      woman: &ldquo;Pierre, what news did you give to that lady and her son on the
      road? What is going on here? Why are you hiding? I must know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words brought a look on the Chouan&rsquo;s face which Francine had never
      seen there before. The Breton led his innocent mistress to the door; there
      he turned her towards the blanching light of the moon, and answered, as he
      looked in her face with terrifying eyes: &ldquo;Yes, by my damnation, Francine,
      I will tell you, but not until you have sworn on these beads (and he
      pulled an old chaplet from beneath his goatskin)&mdash;on this relic,
      which <i>you know well</i>,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to answer me truly one
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine colored as she saw the chaplet, which was no doubt a token of
      their love. &ldquo;It was on that,&rdquo; he added, much agitated, &ldquo;that you swore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. The young girl placed her hand on the lips
      of her savage lover and silenced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need I swear?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his mistress gently by the hand, looked at her for a moment and
      said: &ldquo;Is the lady you are with really Mademoiselle de Verneuil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine stood with hanging arms, her eyelids lowered, her head bowed,
      pale and speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a strumpet!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre, in a terrifying voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word the pretty hand once more covered his lips, but this time he
      sprang back violently. The girl no longer saw a lover; he had turned to a
      wild beast in all the fury of its nature. His eyebrows were drawn
      together, his lips drew apart, and he showed his teeth like a dog which
      defends its master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left you pure, and I find you muck. Ha! why did I ever leave you! You
      are here to betray us; to deliver up the Gars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These sentences sounded more like roars than words. Though Francine was
      frightened, she raised her angelic eyes at this last accusation and
      answered calmly, as she looked into his savage face: &ldquo;I will pledge my
      eternal safety that that is false. That&rsquo;s an idea of the lady you are
      serving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his head; then she took his hand and nestling to him with a
      pretty movement said: &ldquo;Pierre, what is all this to you and me? I don&rsquo;t
      know what you understand about it, but I can&rsquo;t make it out. Recollect one
      thing: that noble and beautiful young lady has been my benefactress; she
      is also yours&mdash;we live together like two sisters. No harm must ever
      come to her where we are, you and I&mdash;in our lifetime at least. Swear
      it! I trust no one here but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t command here,&rdquo; said the Chouan, in a surly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face darkened. She caught his long ears and twisted them gently as if
      playing with a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she said, seeing that he looked less stern, &ldquo;promise me to use
      all the power you have to protect our benefactress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head as if he doubted of success, and the motion made her
      tremble. At this critical moment the escort was entering the courtyard.
      The tread of the soldiers and the rattle of their weapons awoke the echoes
      and seemed to put an end to Marche-a-Terre&rsquo;s indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can save her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you make her stay in the house. And
      mind,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;whatever happens, you must stay with her and keep
      silence; if not, no safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise it,&rdquo; she replied in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then go in&mdash;go in at once, and hide your fears from every
      one, even your mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his hand; he stood for a moment watching her with an almost
      paternal air as she ran with the lightness of a bird up the portico; then
      he slipped behind the bushes, like an actor darting behind the scenes as
      the curtain rises on a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Merle,&rdquo; said Gerard as they reached the chateau, &ldquo;that this
      place looks to me like a mousetrap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I think,&rdquo; said the captain, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two officers hastened to post sentinels to guard the gate and the
      causeway; then they examined with great distrust the precipitous banks of
      the lakes and the surroundings of the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Merle, &ldquo;we must do one of two things: either trust ourselves
      in this barrack with perfect confidence, or else not enter it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; replied Gerard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers, released at the word of command, hastened to stack their
      muskets in conical sheaves, and to form a sort of line before the litter
      of straw, in the middle of which was the promised barrel of cider. They
      then divided into groups, to whom two peasants began to distribute butter
      and rye-bread. The marquis appeared in the portico to welcome the officers
      and take them to the salon. As Gerard went up the steps he looked at both
      ends of the portico, where some venerable larches spread their black
      branches; and he called up Clef-des-Coeurs and Beau-Pied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will each reconnoitre the gardens and search the bushes, and post a
      sentry before your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we light our fire before starting, adjutant?&rdquo; asked Clef-des-Coeurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerard nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! you see, Clef-des-Coeurs,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied, &ldquo;the adjutant&rsquo;s wrong
      to run himself into this wasp&rsquo;s-nest. If Hulot was in command we shouldn&rsquo;t
      be cornered here&mdash;in a saucepan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a stupid you are!&rdquo; replied Clef-des-Coeurs, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you guessed,
      you knave of tricks, that this is the home of the beauty our jovial Merle
      has been whistling round? He&rsquo;ll marry her to a certainty&mdash;that&rsquo;s as
      clear as a well-rubbed bayonet. A woman like that will do honor to the
      brigade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True for you,&rdquo; replied Beau-Pied, &ldquo;and you may add that she gives pretty
      good cider&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t drink it in peace till I know what&rsquo;s behind
      those devilish hedges. I always remember poor Larose and Vieux-Chapeau
      rolling down the ditch at La Pelerine. I shall recollect Larose&rsquo;s queue to
      the end of my days; it went hammering down like the knocker of a front
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beau-Pied, my friend; you have too much imagination for a soldier; you
      ought to be making songs at the national Institute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve too much imagination,&rdquo; retorted Beau-Pied, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t any; it
      will take you some time to get your degree as consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh put an end to the discussion, for Clef-des-Coeurs found no
      suitable reply in his pouch with which to floor his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and make our rounds; I&rsquo;ll go to the right,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, I&rsquo;ll take the left,&rdquo; replied his comrade. &ldquo;But stop one
      minute, I must have a glass of cider; my throat is glued together like the
      oiled-silk of Hulot&rsquo;s best hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The left bank of the gardens, which Clef-des-Coeurs thus delayed searching
      at once, was, unhappily, the dangerous slope where Francine had seen the
      moving line of men. All things go by chance in war.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Gerard entered the salon and bowed to the company he cast a penetrating
      eye on the men who were present. Suspicions came forcibly to his mind, and
      he went at once to Mademoiselle de Verneuil and said in a low voice: &ldquo;I
      think you had better leave this place immediately. We are not safe here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you fear while I am with you?&rdquo; she answered, laughing. &ldquo;You are
      safer here than you would be at Mayenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman answers for her lover in good faith. The two officers were
      reassured. The party now moved into the dining-room after some discussion
      about a guest, apparently of some importance, who had not appeared.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was able, thanks to the silence which always
      reigns at the beginning of a meal, to give some attention to the character
      of the assemblage, which was curious enough under existing circumstances.
      One thing struck her with surprise. The Republican officers seemed
      superior to the rest of the assembly by reason of their dignified
      appearance. Their long hair tied behind in a queue drew lines beside their
      foreheads which gave, in those days, an expression of great candor and
      nobleness to young heads. Their threadbare blue uniforms with the shabby
      red facings, even their epaulets flung back behind their shoulders (a sign
      throughout the army, even among the leaders, of a lack of overcoats),&mdash;all
      these things brought the two Republican officers into strong relief
      against the men who surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are the Nation, and that means liberty!&rdquo; thought Marie; then,
      with a glance at the royalists, she added, &ldquo;on the other side is a man, a
      king, and privileges.&rdquo; She could not refrain from admiring Merle, so
      thoroughly did that gay soldier respond to the ideas she had formed of the
      French trooper who hums a tune when the balls are whistling, and jests
      when a comrade falls. Gerard was more imposing. Grave and self-possessed,
      he seemed to have one of those truly Republican spirits which, in the days
      of which we write, crowded the French armies, and gave them, by means of
      these noble individual devotions, an energy which they had never before
      possessed. &ldquo;That is one of my men with great ideals,&rdquo; thought Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil. &ldquo;Relying on the present, which they rule, they destroy the
      past for the benefit of the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought saddened her because she could not apply it to her lover;
      towards whom she now turned, to discard by a different admiration, these
      beliefs in the Republic she was already beginning to dislike. Looking at
      the marquis, surrounded by men who were bold enough, fanatical enough, and
      sufficiently long-headed as to the future to give battle to a victorious
      Republic in the hope of restoring a dead monarchy, a proscribed religion,
      fugitive princes, and lost privileges, &ldquo;He,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;has no less an
      aim than the others; clinging to those fragments, he wants to make a
      future from the past.&rdquo; Her mind, thus grasped by conflicting images,
      hesitated between the new and the old wrecks. Her conscience told her that
      the one was fighting for a man, the other for a country; but she had now
      reached, through her feelings, the point to which reason will also bring
      us, namely: to a recognition that the king <i>is</i> the Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps of a man echoed in the adjoining room, and the marquis rose from
      the table to greet him. He proved to be the expected guest, and seeing the
      assembled company he was about to speak, when the Gars made him a hasty
      sign, which he concealed from the Republicans, to take his place and say
      nothing. The more the two officers analyzed the faces about them, the more
      their suspicions increased. The clerical dress of the Abbe Gudin and the
      singularity of the Chouan garments were so many warnings to them; they
      redoubled their watchfulness, and soon discovered many discrepancies
      between the manners of the guests and the topics of their conversation.
      The republicanism of some was quite as exaggerated as the aristocratic
      bearing of others was unmistakable. Certain glances which they detected
      between the marquis and his guests, certain words of double meaning
      imprudently uttered, but above all the fringe of beard which was round the
      necks of several of the men and was very ill-concealed by their cravats,
      brought the officers at last to a full conviction of the truth, which
      flashed upon their minds at the same instant. They gave each other one
      look, for Madame du Gua had cleverly separated them and they could only
      impart their thoughts by their eyes. Such a situation demanded the utmost
      caution. They did not know whether they and their men were masters of the
      situation, or whether they had been drawn into a trap, or whether
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was the dupe or the accomplice of this
      inexplicable state of things. But an unforeseen event precipitated a
      crisis before they had fully recognized the gravity of their situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new guest was one of those solid men who are square at the base and
      square at the shoulders, with ruddy skins; men who lean backward when they
      walk, seeming to displace much atmosphere about them, and who appear to
      think that more than one glance of the eye is needful to take them in.
      Notwithstanding his rank, he had taken life as a joke from which he was to
      get as much amusement as possible; and yet, although he knelt at his own
      shrine only, he was kind, polite, and witty, after the fashion of those
      noblemen who, having finished their training at court, return to live on
      their estates, and never suspect that they have, at the end of twenty
      years, grown rusty. Men of this type fail in tact with imperturbable
      coolness, talk folly wittily, distrust good with extreme shrewdness, and
      take incredible pains to fall into traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, by a play of his knife and fork which proclaimed him a good feeder,
      he had made up for lost time, he began to look round on the company. His
      astonishment was great when he observed the two Republican officers, and
      he questioned Madame du Gua with a look, while she, for all answer, showed
      him Mademoiselle de Verneuil in the same way. When he saw the siren whose
      demeanor had silenced the suspicions Madame du Gua had excited among the
      guests, the face of the stout stranger broke into one of those insolent,
      ironical smiles which contain a whole history of scandal. He leaned to his
      next neighbor and whispered a few words, which went from ear to ear and
      lip to lip, passing Marie and the two officers, until they reached the
      heart of one whom they struck to death. The leaders of the Vendeans and
      the Chouans assembled round that table looked at the Marquis de Montauran
      with cruel curiosity. The eyes of Madame du Gua, flashing with joy, turned
      from the marquis to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who was speechless with
      surprise. The Republican officers, uneasy in mind, questioned each other&rsquo;s
      thoughts as they awaited the result of this extraordinary scene. In a
      moment the forks remained inactive in every hand, silence reigned, and
      every eye was turned to the Gars. A frightful anger showed upon his face,
      which turned waxen in tone. He leaned towards the guest from whom the
      rocket had started and said, in a voice that seemed muffled in crape,
      &ldquo;Death of my soul! count, is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor,&rdquo; said the count, bowing gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis lowered his eyes for a moment, then he raised them and looked
      fixedly at Marie, who, watchful of his struggle, knew that look to be her
      death-warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give my life,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;for revenge on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua understood the words from the mere movement of the young
      man&rsquo;s lips, and she smiled upon him as we smile at a friend whose regrets
      are about to cease. The scorn felt for Mademoiselle de Verneuil and shown
      on every face, brought to its height the growing indignation of the two
      Republicans, who now rose hastily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want anything, citizens?&rdquo; asked Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our swords, <i>citoyenne</i>,&rdquo; said Gerard, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not need them at table,&rdquo; said the marquis, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but we are going to play at a game you know very well,&rdquo; replied
      Gerard. &ldquo;This is La Pelerine over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole party seemed dumfounded. Just then a volley, fired with terrible
      regularity, echoed through the courtyard. The two officers sprang to the
      portico; there they beheld a hundred or so of Chouans aiming at the few
      soldiers who were not shot down at the first discharge; these they fired
      upon as upon so many hares. The Bretons swarmed from the bank, where
      Marche-a-Terre had posted them at the peril of their lives; for after the
      last volley, and mingling with the cries of the dying, several Chouans
      were heard to fall into the lake, where they were lost like stones in a
      gulf. Pille-Miche took aim at Gerard; Marche-a-Terre held Merle at his
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the marquis to Merle, repeating to the Republican his own
      words, &ldquo;you see that men are like medlars, they ripen on the straw.&rdquo; He
      pointed with a wave of his hand to the entire escort of the Blues lying on
      the bloody litter where the Chouans were despatching those who still
      breathed, and rifling the dead bodies with incredible rapidity. &ldquo;I was
      right when I told you that your soldiers will not get as far as La
      Pelerine. I think, moreover, that your head will fill with lead before
      mine. What say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montauran felt a horrible necessity to vent his rage. His bitter sarcasm,
      the ferocity, even the treachery of this military execution, done without
      his orders, but which he now accepted, satisfied in some degree the
      craving of his heart. In his fury he would fain have annihilated France.
      The dead Blues, the living officers, all innocent of the crime for which
      he demanded vengeance, were to him the cards by which a gambler cheats his
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather perish than conquer as you are conquering,&rdquo; said Gerard.
      Then, seeing the naked and bloody corpses of his men, he cried out,
      &ldquo;Murdered basely, in cold blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was how you murdered Louis XVI., monsieur,&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Gerard, haughtily, &ldquo;there are mysteries in a king&rsquo;s
      trial which you could never comprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to accuse the king?&rdquo; exclaimed the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to fight your country?&rdquo; retorted Gerard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly!&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parricide!&rdquo; exclaimed the Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; cried Merle, gaily, &ldquo;a pretty time to quarrel at the moment
      of your death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Gerard, coldly, turning to the marquis. &ldquo;Monsieur, if it is
      your intention to put us to death, at least have the goodness to shoot us
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s like you, Gerard,&rdquo; said Merle, &ldquo;always in a hurry to finish
      things. But if one has to travel far and can&rsquo;t breakfast on the morrow, at
      least we might sup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gerard sprang forward without a word towards the wall. Pille-Miche covered
      him, glancing as he did so at the motionless marquis, whose silence he
      took for an order, and the adjutant-major fell like a tree. Marche-a-Terre
      ran to share the fresh booty with Pille-Miche; like two hungry crows they
      disputed and clamored over the still warm body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really wish to finish your supper, captain, you can come with me,&rdquo;
       said the marquis to Merle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain followed him mechanically, saying in a low voice: &ldquo;It is that
      devil of a strumpet that caused all this. What will Hulot say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strumpet!&rdquo; cried the marquis in a strangled voice, &ldquo;then she is one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain seemed to have given Montauran a death-blow, for he re-entered
      the house with a staggering step, pale, haggard, and undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another scene had meanwhile taken place in the dining-room, which assumed,
      in the marquis&rsquo;s absence, such a threatening character that Marie, alone
      without her protector, might well fancy she read her death-warrant in the
      eyes of her rival. At the noise of the volley the guests all sprang to
      their feet, but Madame du Gua remained seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;our men are despatching the Blues.&rdquo; Then,
      seeing the marquis outside on the portico, she rose. &ldquo;Mademoiselle whom
      you here see,&rdquo; she continued, with the calmness of concentrated fury,
      &ldquo;came here to betray the Gars! She meant to deliver him up to the
      Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have done so twenty times to-day and yet I saved his life,&rdquo; said
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua sprang upon her rival like lightning; in her blind
      excitement she tore apart the fastenings of the young girl&rsquo;s spencer, the
      stuff, the embroidery, the corset, the chemise, and plunged her savage
      hand into the bosom where, as she well knew, a letter lay hidden. In doing
      this her jealousy so bruised and tore the palpitating throat of her rival,
      taken by surprise at the sudden attack, that she left the bloody marks of
      her nails, feeling a sort of pleasure in making her submit to so degrading
      a prostitution. In the feeble struggle which Marie made against the
      furious woman, her hair became unfastened and fell in undulating curls
      about her shoulders; her face glowed with outraged modesty, and tears made
      their burning way along her cheeks, heightening the brilliancy of her
      eyes, as she quivered with shame before the looks of the assembled men.
      The hardest judge would have believed in her innocence when he saw her
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hatred is so uncalculating that Madame du Gua did not perceive she had
      overshot her mark, and that no one listened to her as she cried
      triumphantly: &ldquo;You shall now see, gentlemen, whether I have slandered that
      horrible creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so horrible,&rdquo; said the bass voice of the guest who had thrown the
      first stone. &ldquo;But for my part, I like such horrors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; continued the cruel woman, &ldquo;is an order signed by Laplace, and
      counter-signed by Dubois, minister of war.&rdquo; At these names several heads
      were turned to her. &ldquo;Listen to the wording of it,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The military citizen commanders of all grades, the district
  administrators, the <i>procureur-syndics</i>, et cetera, of the
  insurgent departments, and particularly those of the localities in
  which the ci-devant Marquis de Montauran, leader of the brigands
  and otherwise known as the Gars, may be found, are hereby
  commanded to give aid and assistance to the <i>citoyenne</i> Marie
  Verneuil and to obey the orders which she may give them at her
  discretion.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthless hussy takes a noble name to soil it with such treachery,&rdquo;
       added Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement of astonishment ran through the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fight is not even if the Republic employs such pretty women against
      us,&rdquo; said the Baron du Guenic gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially women who have nothing to lose,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; cried the Chevalier du Vissard. &ldquo;Mademoiselle has a property
      which probably brings her in a pretty good sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Republic must like a joke, to send strumpets for ambassadors,&rdquo; said
      the Abbe Gudin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, Mademoiselle seeks the joys that kill,&rdquo; said Madame du
      Gua, with a horrible expression of pleasure at the end she foresaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you still living?&rdquo; said her victim, rising to her feet,
      after repairing the disorder of her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bitter sarcasm excited a sort of respect for so brave a victim, and
      silenced the assembly. Madame du Gua saw a satirical smile on the lips of
      the men, which infuriated her, and paying no attention to the marquis and
      Merle who were entering the room, she called to the Chouan who followed
      them. &ldquo;Pille-Miche!&rdquo; she said, pointing to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, &ldquo;take
      her; she is my share of the booty, and I turn her over to you&mdash;do
      what you like with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the whole assembly shuddered, for the hideous heads of
      Pille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre appeared behind the marquis, and the
      punishment was seen in all its horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was standing with clasped hands as though paralyzed. Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil, who recovered her presence of mind before the danger that
      threatened her, cast a look of contempt at the assembled men, snatched the
      letter from Madame du Gua&rsquo;s hand, threw up her head with a flashing eye,
      and darted towards the door where Merle&rsquo;s sword was still leaning. There
      she came upon the marquis, cold and motionless as a statue. Nothing
      pleaded for her on his fixed, firm features. Wounded to the heart, life
      seemed odious to her. The man who had pledged her so much love must have
      heard the odious jests that were cast upon her, and stood there silently a
      witness of the infamy she had been made to endure. She might, perhaps,
      have forgiven him his contempt, but she could not forgive his having seen
      her in so humiliating a position, and she flung him a look that was full
      of hatred, feeling in her heart the birth of an unutterable desire for
      vengeance. With death beside her, the sense of impotence almost strangled
      her. A whirlwind of passion and madness rose in her head; the blood which
      boiled in her veins made everything about her seem like a conflagration.
      Instead of killing herself, she seized the sword and thrust it though the
      marquis. But the weapon slipped between his arm and side; he caught her by
      the wrist and dragged her from the room, aided by Pille-Miche, who had
      flung himself upon the furious creature when she attacked his master.
      Francine shrieked aloud. &ldquo;Pierre! Pierre! Pierre!&rdquo; she cried in
      heart-rending tones, as she followed her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis closed the door on the astonished company. When he reached the
      portico he was still holding the woman&rsquo;s wrist, which he clasped
      convulsively, while Pille-Miche had almost crushed the bones of her arm
      with his iron fingers, but Marie felt only the burning hand of the young
      leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hurt me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all answer he looked at her a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you some base revenge to take&mdash;like that woman?&rdquo; she said.
      Then, seeing the dead bodies on the heap of straw, she cried out,
      shuddering: &ldquo;The faith of a gentleman! ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; With a frightful laugh
      she added: &ldquo;Ha! the glorious day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a day without a morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let go her hand and took a long, last look at the beautiful creature he
      could scarcely even then renounce. Neither of these proud natures yielded.
      The marquis may have looked for a tear, but the eyes of the girl were dry
      and scornful. Then he turned quickly, and left the victim to Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God will hear me, marquis,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I will ask Him to give you a
      glorious day without a morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pille-Miche, not a little embarrassed with so rich a prize, dragged her
      away with some gentleness and a mixture of respect and scorn. The marquis,
      with a sigh, re-entered the dining-room, his face like that of a dead man
      whose eyes have not been closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merle&rsquo;s presence was inexplicable to the silent spectators of this
      tragedy; they looked at him in astonishment and their eyes questioned each
      other. Merle saw their amazement, and, true to his native character, he
      said, with a smile: &ldquo;Gentlemen, you will scarcely refuse a glass of wine
      to a man who is about to make his last journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just as the company had calmed down under the influence of these
      words, said with a true French carelessness which pleased the Vendeans,
      that Montauran returned, his face pale, his eyes fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you shall see,&rdquo; said Merle, &ldquo;how death can make men lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the marquis, with a gesture as if suddenly awaking, &ldquo;here you
      are, my dear councillor of war,&rdquo; and he passed him a bottle of <i>vin de
      Grave</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks, citizen marquis,&rdquo; replied Merle. &ldquo;Now I can divert myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this sally Madame du Gua turned to the other guests with a smile,
      saying, &ldquo;Let us spare him the dessert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very cruel vengeance, madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You forget my murdered
      friend who is waiting for me; I never miss an appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the marquis, throwing him his glove, &ldquo;you are free; that&rsquo;s
      your passport. The Chasseurs du Roi know that they must not kill all the
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for me!&rdquo; replied Merle, &ldquo;but you are making a mistake;
      we shall come to close quarters before long, and I&rsquo;ll not let you off.
      Though your head can never pay for Gerard&rsquo;s, I want it and I shall have
      it. Adieu. I could drink with my own assassins, but I cannot stay with
      those of my friend&rdquo;; and he disappeared, leaving the guests astonished at
      his coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what do you think of the lawyers and surgeons and
      bailiffs who manage the Republic,&rdquo; said the Gars, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s-death! marquis,&rdquo; replied the Comte de Bauvan; &ldquo;they have shocking
      manners; that fellow presumed to be impertinent, it seems to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s hasty retreat had a motive. The despised, humiliated woman,
      who was even then, perhaps, being put to death, had so won upon him during
      the scene of her degradation that he said to himself, as he left the room,
      &ldquo;If she is a prostitute, she is not an ordinary one, and I&rsquo;ll marry her.&rdquo;
       He felt so sure of being able to rescue her from the savages that his
      first thought, when his own life was given to him, was to save hers.
      Unhappily, when he reached the portico, he found the courtyard deserted.
      He looked about him, listened to the silence, and could hear nothing but
      the distant shouts and laughter of the Chouans, who were drinking in the
      gardens and dividing their booty. He turned the corner to the fatal wing
      before which his men had been shot, and from there he could distinguish,
      by the feeble light of a few stray lanterns, the different groups of the
      Chasseurs du Roi. Neither Pille-Miche, nor Marche-a-Terre, nor the girl
      were visible; but he felt himself gently pulled by the flap of his
      uniform, and, turning round, saw Francine on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; Pierre drove me back and told me not to stir from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That way,&rdquo; she replied, pointing to the causeway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain and Francine then noticed in that direction a line of strong
      shadows thrown by the moonlight on the lake, and among them that of a
      female figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she!&rdquo; cried Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil seemed to be standing, as if resigned, in the
      midst of other figures, whose gestures denoted a debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Well, no matter, let us go to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get yourself killed uselessly,&rdquo; said Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been killed once before to-day,&rdquo; he said gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both walked towards the gloomy gateway which led to the causeway;
      there Francine suddenly stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go no farther; Pierre told me not to meddle;
      I believe in him; if we go on we shall spoil all. Do as you please,
      officer, but leave me. If Pierre saw us together he would kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Pille-Miche appeared in the gateway and called to the postilion
      who was left in the stable. At the same moment he saw the captain and
      covered him with his musket, shouting out, &ldquo;By Saint Anne of Auray! the
      rector was right enough in telling us the Blues had signed a compact with
      the devil. I&rsquo;ll bring you to life, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! my life is sacred,&rdquo; cried Merle, seeing his danger. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
      glove of your Gars,&rdquo; and he held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts&rsquo; lives are not sacred,&rdquo; replied the Chouan, &ldquo;and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give
      you yours. Ave Maria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fired, and the ball passed through his victim&rsquo;s head. The captain fell.
      When Francine reached him she heard him mutter the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die
      with them than return without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouan sprang upon the body to strip it, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one good
      thing about ghosts, they come to life in their clothes.&rdquo; Then, recognizing
      the Gars&rsquo; glove, that sacred safeguard, in the captain&rsquo;s hand, he stopped
      short, terrified. &ldquo;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t in the skin of my mother&rsquo;s son!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, as he turned and disappeared with the rapidity of a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand this scene, so fatal to poor Merle, we must follow
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil after the marquis, in his fury and despair, had
      abandoned her to Pille-Miche. Francine had caught Marche-a-Terre by the
      arm and reminded him, with sobs, of the promise he had made her.
      Pille-Miche was already dragging away his victim like a heavy bundle.
      Marie, her head and hair hanging back, turned her eyes to the lake; but
      held as she was in a grasp of iron she was forced to follow the Chouan,
      who turned now and then to hasten her steps, and each time that he did so
      a jovial thought brought a hideous smile upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a morsel!&rdquo; he cried, with a coarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words, Francine recovered speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll kill herself, she will never submit; and if she dies I shall
      die too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you love her too much, and she shall die,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre! if we are rich and happy we owe it all to her; but, whether or
      no, you promised me to save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try; but you must stay here, and don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine at once let go his arm, and waited in horrible suspense in the
      courtyard where Merle found her. Meantime Marche-a-Terre joined his
      comrade at the moment when the latter, after dragging his victim to the
      barn, was compelling her to get into the coach. Pille-Miche called to him
      to help in pulling out the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with all that?&rdquo; asked Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Grande Garce gave me the woman, and all that belongs to her is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coach will put a sou or two in your pocket; but as for the woman,
      she&rsquo;ll scratch your eyes out like a cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pille-Miche burst into a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tie her up and take her home,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; suppose we harness the horses,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Marche-a-Terre, who had left his comrade mounting
      guard over his prey, led the coach from the stable to the causeway, where
      Pille-Miche got into it beside Mademoiselle de Verneuil, not perceiving
      that she was on the point of making a spring into the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Pille-Miche!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy all your booty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; asked the other, catching his prisoner by the petticoat,
      as a butcher catches a calf that is trying to escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see her, and I&rsquo;ll set a price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate creature was made to leave the coach and stand between the
      two Chouans, who each held a hand and looked at her as the Elders must
      have looked at Susannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take thirty francs in good coin?&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, with a
      groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done?&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, done; I can get plenty of Breton girls for that, and choice morsels,
      too. But the coach; whose is that?&rdquo; asked Pille-Miche, beginning to
      reflect upon his bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre, in a terrible tone of voice, which showed
      the sort of superiority his ferocious character gave him over his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose there&rsquo;s money in the coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say, &lsquo;Done&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I said, &lsquo;Done.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then go and fetch the postilion who is gagged in the stable
      over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s money in the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any?&rdquo; asked Marche-a-Terre, roughly, shaking Marie by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about a hundred crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, friend,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t quarrel for a female
      Blue; let&rsquo;s pitch her into the lake with a stone around her neck, and
      divide the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you that money as my share in d&rsquo;Orgemont&rsquo;s ransom,&rdquo; said
      Marche-a-Terre, smothering a groan, caused by such sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pille-Miche uttered a sort of hoarse cry as he started to find the
      postilion, and his glee brought death to Merle, whom he met on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the shot, Marche-a-Terre rushed in the direction where he had left
      Francine, and found her praying on her knees, with clasped hands, beside
      the poor captain, whose murder had deeply horrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run to your mistress,&rdquo; said the Chouan; &ldquo;she is saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran himself to fetch the postilion, returning with all speed, and, as
      he repassed Merle&rsquo;s body, he noticed the Gars&rsquo; glove, which was still
      convulsively clasped in the dead hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Pille-Miche has blundered horribly&mdash;he won&rsquo;t live
      to spend his crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched up the glove and said to Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who was
      already in the coach with Francine: &ldquo;Here, take this glove. If any of our
      men attack you on the road, call out &lsquo;Ho, the Gars!&rsquo; show the glove, and
      no harm can happen to you. Francine,&rdquo; he said, turning towards her and
      seizing her violently, &ldquo;you and I are quits with that woman; come with me
      and let the devil have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ask me to abandon her just at this moment!&rdquo; cried Francine, in
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre scratched his ear and forehead, then he raised his head,
      and his mistress saw the ferocious expression of his eyes. &ldquo;You are
      right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I leave you with her one week; if at the end of that
      time you don&rsquo;t come with me&mdash;&rdquo; he did not finish the sentence, but he
      slapped the muzzle of his gun with the flat of his hand. After making the
      gesture of taking aim at her, he disappeared, without waiting for her
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was he gone than a voice, which seemed to issue from the lake,
      called, in a muffled tone: &ldquo;Madame, madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postilion and the two women shuddered, for several corpses were
      floating near them. A Blue, hidden behind a tree, cautiously appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get up behind the coach, or I&rsquo;m a dead man. That damned cider
      which Clef-des-Coeurs would stop to drink cost more than a pint of blood.
      If he had done as I did, and made his round, our poor comrades there
      wouldn&rsquo;t be floating dead in the pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      While these events were taking place outside the chateau, the leaders sent
      by the Vendeans and those of the Chouans were holding a council of war,
      with their glasses in their hands, under the presidency of the Marquis de
      Montauran. Frequent libations of Bordeaux animated the discussion, which,
      however, became more serious and important at the end of the meal. After
      the general plan of military operations had been decided on, the Royalists
      drank to the health of the Bourbons. It was at that moment that the shot
      which killed Merle was heard, like an echo of the disastrous war which
      these gay and noble conspirators were about to make against the Republic.
      Madame du Gua quivered with pleasure at the thought that she was freed
      from her rival; the guests looked at each other in silence; the marquis
      rose from the table and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loved her!&rdquo; said Madame du Gua, sarcastically. &ldquo;Follow him, Monsieur
      de Fontaine, and keep him company; he will be as irritating as a fly if we
      let him sulk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to a window which looked on the courtyard to endeavor to see
      Marie&rsquo;s body. There, by the last gleams of the sinking moon, she caught
      sight of the coach being rapidly driven down the avenue of apple-trees.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s veil was fluttering in the wind. Madame du Gua,
      furious at the sight, left the room hurriedly. The marquis, standing on
      the portico absorbed in gloomy thought, was watching about a hundred and
      fifty Chouans, who, having divided their booty in the gardens, were now
      returning to finish the cider and the rye-bread provided for the Blues.
      These soldiers of a new species, on whom the monarchy was resting its
      hopes, dispersed into groups. Some drank the cider; others, on the bank
      before the portico, amused themselves by flinging into the lake the dead
      bodies of the Blues, to which they fastened stones. This sight, joined to
      the other aspects of the strange scene,&mdash;the fantastic dress, the
      savage expressions of the barbarous and uncouth <i>gars</i>,&mdash;was so
      new and so amazing to Monsieur de Fontaine, accustomed to the nobler and
      better-regulated appearance of the Vendean troops, that he seized the
      occasion to say to the Marquis de Montauran, &ldquo;What do you expect to do
      with such brutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much, my dear count,&rdquo; replied the Gars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they ever be fit to manoeuvre before the enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can they understand or execute an order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what good will they be to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will help me to plunge my sword into the entrails of the Republic,&rdquo;
       replied the marquis in a thundering voice. &ldquo;They will give me Fougeres in
      three days, and all Brittany in ten! Monsieur,&rdquo; he added in a gentler
      voice, &ldquo;start at once for La Vendee; if d&rsquo;Auticamp, Suzannet, and the Abbe
      Bernier will act as rapidly as I do, if they&rsquo;ll not negotiate with the
      First Consul, as I am afraid they will&rdquo; (here he wrung the hand of the
      Vendean chief) &ldquo;we shall be within reach of Paris in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Republic is sending sixty thousand men and General Brune against
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty thousand men! indeed!&rdquo; cried the marquis, with a scoffing laugh.
      &ldquo;And how will Bonaparte carry on the Italian campaign? As for General
      Brune, he is not coming. The First Consul has sent him against the English
      in Holland, and General Hedouville, <i>the friend of our friend Barras</i>,
      takes his place here. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Monsieur de Fontaine heard these words he gave Montauran a look of keen
      intelligence which seemed to say that the marquis had not himself
      understood the real meaning of the words addressed to him. The two leaders
      then comprehended each other perfectly, and the Gars replied with an
      undefinable smile to the thoughts expressed in both their eyes: &ldquo;Monsieur
      de Fontaine, do you know my arms? our motto is &lsquo;Persevere unto death.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Fontaine took Montauran&rsquo;s hand and pressed it, saying: &ldquo;I was
      left for dead at Quatre-Chemins, therefore you need never doubt me. But
      believe in my experience&mdash;times have changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said La Billardiere, who now joined them. &ldquo;You are young, marquis.
      Listen to me; your property has not yet been sold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Montauran, &ldquo;can you conceive of devotion without sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really know the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I admire your loyalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; replied the young chieftain, &ldquo;is the priest; I am fighting not
      for the man, but for the faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted,&mdash;the Vendean leader convinced of the necessity of
      yielding to circumstances and keeping his beliefs in the depths of his
      heart; La Billardiere to return to his negotiations in England; and
      Montauran to fight savagely and compel the Vendeans, by the victories he
      expected to win, to co-operate in his enterprise.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The events of the day had excited such violent emotions in Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil&rsquo;s whole being that she lay back almost fainting in the carriage,
      after giving the order to drive to Fougeres. Francine was as silent as her
      mistress. The postilion, dreading some new disaster, made all the haste he
      could to reach the high-road, and was soon on the summit of La Pelerine.
      Through the thick white mists of morning Marie de Verneuil crossed the
      broad and beautiful valley of Couesnon (where this history began) scarcely
      able to distinguish the slaty rock on which the town of Fougeres stands
      from the slopes of La Pelerine. They were still eight miles from it.
      Shivering with cold herself, Mademoiselle de Verneuil recollected the poor
      soldier behind the carriage, and insisted, against his remonstrances, in
      taking him into the carriage beside Francine. The sight of Fougeres drew
      her for a time out of her reflections. The sentinels stationed at the
      Porte Saint-Leonard refused to allow ingress to the strangers, and she was
      therefore obliged to exhibit the ministerial order. This at once gave her
      safety in entering the town, but the postilion could find no other place
      for her to stop at than the Poste inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the Blue whose life she had saved. &ldquo;If you ever want a
      sabre to deal some special blow, my life is yours. I am good for that. My
      name is Jean Falcon, otherwise called Beau-Pied, sergeant of the first
      company of Hulot&rsquo;s veterans, seventy-second half-brigade, nicknamed &lsquo;Les
      Mayencais.&rsquo; Excuse my vanity; I can only offer you the soul of a sergeant,
      but that&rsquo;s at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel and walked off whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lower one goes in social life,&rdquo; said Marie, bitterly, &ldquo;the more we
      find generous feelings without display. A marquis returns death for life,
      and a poor sergeant&mdash;but enough of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the weary woman was at last in a warm bed, her faithful Francine
      waited in vain for the affectionate good-night to which she was
      accustomed; but her mistress, seeing her still standing and evidently
      uneasy, made her a sign of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is called a day, Francine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I have aged ten years in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, as soon as she had risen, Corentin came to see her and
      she admitted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;my degradation is great indeed, for the
      thought of that man is not disagreeable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, when she saw him, she felt once more, for the hundredth time, the
      instinctive repulsion which two years&rsquo; intercourse had increased rather
      than lessened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;I felt certain you were succeeding. Was I
      mistaken? did you get hold of the wrong man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corentin,&rdquo; she replied, with a dull look of pain, &ldquo;never mention that
      affair to me unless I speak of it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down the room casting oblique glances at her, endeavoring
      to guess the secret thoughts of the singular woman whose mere glance had
      the power of discomfiting at times the cleverest men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I foresaw this check,&rdquo; he replied, after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;If you
      would be willing to establish your headquarters in this town, I have
      already found a suitable place for you. We are in the very centre of
      Chouannerie. Will you stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered with an affirmative sign, which enabled Corentin to make
      conjectures, partly correct, as to the events of the preceding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hire a house for you, a bit of national property still unsold. They
      are behind the age in these parts. No one has dared buy the old barrack
      because it belonged to an <i>emigre</i> who was thought to be harsh. It is
      close to the church of Saint Leonard; and on my word of honor the view
      from it is delightful. Something can really be made of the old place; will
      you try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at once,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a few hours to have it cleaned and put in order for you, so that
      you may like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could live in a cloister or a prison without
      caring. However, see that everything is in order before night, so that I
      may sleep there in perfect solitude. Go, leave me; your presence is
      intolerable. I wish to be alone with Francine; she is better for me than
      my own company, perhaps. Adieu; go&mdash;go, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, said volubly with a mingling of coquetry, despotism, and
      passion, showed she had entirely recovered her self-possession. Sleep had
      no doubt classified the impressions of the preceding day, and reflection
      had determined her on vengeance. If a few reluctant signs appeared on her
      face they only proved the ease with which certain women can bury the
      better feelings of their souls, and the cruel dissimulation which enables
      them to smile sweetly while planning the destruction of a victim. She sat
      alone after Corentin had left her, thinking how she could get the marquis
      still living into her toils. For the first time in her life this woman had
      lived according to her inmost desires; but of that life nothing remained
      but one craving,&mdash;that of vengeance,&mdash;vengeance complete and
      infinite. It was her one thought, her sole desire. Francine&rsquo;s words and
      attentions were unnoticed. Marie seemed to be sleeping with her eyes open;
      and the long day passed without an action or even a gesture that bore
      testimony to her thoughts. She lay on a couch which she had made of chairs
      and pillows. It was late in the evening when a few words escaped her, as
      if involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said to Francine, &ldquo;I understood yesterday what it was to
      live for love; to-day I know what it means to die for vengeance. Yes, I
      will give my life to seek him wherever he may be, to meet him, seduce him,
      make him mine! If I do not have that man, who dared to despise me, at my
      feet humble and submissive, if I do not make him my lackey and my slave, I
      shall indeed be base; I shall not be a woman; I shall not be myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house which Corentin now hired for Mademoiselle de Verneuil offered
      many gratifications to the innate love of luxury and elegance that was
      part of this girl. The capricious creature took possession of it with
      regal composure, as of a thing which already belonged to her; she
      appropriated the furniture and arranged it with intuitive sympathy, as
      though she had known it all her life. This is a vulgar detail, but one
      that is not unimportant in sketching the character of so exceptional a
      person. She seemed to have been already familiarized in a dream with the
      house in which she now lived on her hatred as she might have lived on her
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I did not rouse insulting pity in him; I
      do not owe him my life. Oh, my first, my last, my only love! what an end
      to it!&rdquo; She sprang upon Francine, who was terrified. &ldquo;Do you love a man?
      Oh, yes, yes, I remember; you do. I am glad I have a woman here who can
      understand me. Ah, my poor Francette, man is a miserable being. Ha! he
      said he loved me, and his love could not bear the slightest test! But I,&mdash;if
      all men had accused him I would have defended him; if the universe
      rejected him my soul should have been his refuge. In the old days life was
      filled with human beings coming and going for whom I did not care; it was
      sad and dull, but not horrible; but now, now, what is life without him? He
      will live on, and I not near him! I shall not see him, speak to him, feel
      him, hold him, press him,&mdash;ha! I would rather strangle him myself in
      his sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine, horrified, looked at her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill the man you love?&rdquo; she said, in a soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, if he ceases to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after those ruthless words she hid her face in her hands, and sat down
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day a man presented himself without being announced. His face was
      stern. It was Hulot, followed by Corentin. Mademoiselle de Verneuil looked
      at the commandant and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to ask me to account for your friends. They
      are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and not in the service of the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me, and by me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You preach the nation to me. Can the
      nation bring to life those who die for her? Can she even avenge them? But
      I&mdash;I will avenge them!&rdquo; she cried. The awful images of the
      catastrophe filled her imagination suddenly, and the graceful creature who
      held modesty to be the first of women&rsquo;s wiles forgot herself in a moment
      of madness, and marched towards the amazed commandant brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In exchange for a few murdered soldiers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will bring to the
      block a head that is worth a million heads of other men. It is not a
      woman&rsquo;s business to wage war; but you, old as you are, shall learn good
      stratagems from me. I&rsquo;ll deliver a whole family to your bayonets&mdash;him,
      his ancestors, his past, his future. I will be as false and treacherous to
      him as I was good and true. Yes, commandant, I will bring that little
      noble to my arms, and he shall leave them to go to death. I have no other
      rival. The wretch himself pronounced his doom,&mdash;<i>a day without a
      morrow</i>. Your Republic and I shall be avenged. The Republic!&rdquo; she cried
      in a voice the strange intonations of which horrified Hulot. &ldquo;Is he to die
      for bearing arms against the nation? Shall I suffer France to rob me of my
      vengeance? Ah! what a little thing is life! death can expiate but one
      crime. He has but one head to fall, but I will make him know in one night
      that he loses more than life. Commandant, you who will kill him,&rdquo; and she
      sighed, &ldquo;see that nothing betrays my betrayal; he must die convinced of my
      fidelity. I ask that of you. Let him know only me&mdash;me, and my
      caresses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped; but through the crimson of her cheeks Hulot and Corentin saw
      that rage and delirium had not entirely smothered all sense of shame.
      Marie shuddered violently as she said the words; she seemed to listen to
      them as though she doubted whether she herself had said them, and she made
      the involuntary movement of a woman whose veil is falling from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had him in your power,&rdquo; said Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you stop me when I had him?&rdquo; asked Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know what he would prove to be,&rdquo; she cried. Then, suddenly, the
      excited woman, who was walking up and down with hurried steps and casting
      savage glances at the spectators of the storm, calmed down. &ldquo;I do not know
      myself,&rdquo; she said, in a man&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;Why talk? I must go and find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and find him?&rdquo; said Hulot. &ldquo;My dear woman, take care; we are not yet
      masters of this part of the country; if you venture outside of the town
      you will be taken or killed before you&rsquo;ve gone a hundred yards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never any danger for those who seek vengeance,&rdquo; she said, driving
      from her presence with a disdainful gesture the two men whom she was
      ashamed to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a woman!&rdquo; cried Hulot as he walked away with Corentin. &ldquo;A queer idea
      of those police fellows in Paris to send her here; but she&rsquo;ll never
      deliver him up to us,&rdquo; he added, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, she will,&rdquo; replied Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see she loves him?&rdquo; said Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why she will. Besides,&rdquo; looking at the amazed commandant, &ldquo;I
      am here to see that she doesn&rsquo;t commit any folly. In my opinion, comrade,
      there is no love in the world worth the three hundred thousand francs
      she&rsquo;ll make out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the police diplomatist left the soldier the latter stood looking
      after him, and as the sound of the man&rsquo;s steps died away he gave a sigh,
      muttering to himself, &ldquo;It may be a good thing after all to be such a
      dullard as I am. God&rsquo;s thunder! if I meet the Gars I&rsquo;ll fight him hand to
      hand, or my name&rsquo;s not Hulot; for if that fox brings him before me in any
      of their new-fangled councils of war, my honor will be as soiled as the
      shirt of a young trooper who is under fire for the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The massacre at La Vivetiere, and the desire to avenge his friends had led
      Hulot to accept a reinstatement in his late command; in fact, the new
      minister, Berthier, had refused to accept his resignation under existing
      circumstances. To the official despatch was added a private letter, in
      which, without explaining the mission of Mademoiselle de Verneuil, the
      minister informed him that the affair was entirely outside of the war, and
      not to interfere with any military operations. The duty of the commanders,
      he said, was limited to giving assistance to that honorable <i>citoyenne</i>,
      if occasion arose. Learning from his scouts that the movements of the
      Chouans all tended towards a concentration of their forces in the
      neighborhood of Fougeres, Hulot secretly and with forced marches brought
      two battalions of his brigade into the town. The nation&rsquo;s danger, his
      hatred of aristocracy, whose partisans threatened to convulse so large a
      section of country, his desire to avenge his murdered friends, revived in
      the old veteran the fire of his youth.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the life I craved,&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, when
      she was left alone with Francine. &ldquo;No matter how fast the hours go, they
      are to me like centuries of thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she took Francine&rsquo;s hand, and her voice, soft as that of the
      first red-throat singing after a storm, slowly gave sound to the following
      words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try as I will to forget them, I see those two delicious lips, that chin
      just raised, those eyes of fire; I hear the &lsquo;Hue!&rsquo; of the postilion; I
      dream, I dream,&mdash;why then such hatred on awakening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long sigh, rose, and then for the first time looked out upon
      the country delivered over to civil war by the cruel leader whom she was
      plotting to destroy. Attracted by the scene she wandered out to breathe at
      her ease beneath the sky; and though her steps conducted her at a venture,
      she was surely led to the Promenade of the town by one of those occult
      impulses of the soul which lead us to follow hope irrationally. Thoughts
      conceived under the dominion of that spell are often realized; but we then
      attribute their pre-vision to a power we call presentiment,&mdash;an
      inexplicable power, but a real one,&mdash;which our passions find
      accommodating, like a flatterer who, among his many lies, does sometimes
      tell the truth.

      III. A DAY WITHOUT A MORROW
    </h2>
    <p>
      The preceding events of this history having been greatly influenced by the
      formation of the regions in which they happened, it is desirable to give a
      minute description of them, without which the closing scenes might be
      difficult of comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of Fougeres is partly built upon a slate rock, which seems to
      have slipped from the mountains that hem in the broad valley of Couesnon
      to the west and take various names according to their localities. The town
      is separated from the mountains by a gorge, through which flows a small
      river called the Nancon. To the east, the view is the same as from the
      summit of La Pelerine; to the west, the town looks down into the tortuous
      valley of the Nancon; but there is a spot from which a section of the
      great valley and the picturesque windings of the gorge can be seen at the
      same time. This place, chosen by the inhabitants of the town for their
      Promenade, and to which the steps of Mademoiselle de Verneuil were now
      turned, was destined to be the theatre on which the drama begun at La
      Vivetiere was to end. Therefore, however picturesque the other parts of
      Fougeres may be, attention must be particularly given to the scenery which
      meets the eye from this terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an idea of the rock on which Fougeres stands, as seen on this
      side, we may compare it to one of those immense towers circled by Saracen
      architects with balconies on each story, which were reached by spiral
      stairways. To add to this effect, the rock is capped by a Gothic church,
      the small spires, clock-tower, and buttresses of which make its shape
      almost precisely that of a sugar-loaf. Before the portal of this church,
      which is dedicated to Saint-Leonard, is a small, irregular square, where
      the soil is held up by a buttressed wall, which forms a balustrade and
      communicates by a flight of steps with the Promenade. This public walk,
      like a second cornice, extends round the rock a few rods below the square
      of Saint-Leonard; it is a broad piece of ground planted with trees, and it
      joins the fortifications of the town. About ten rods below the walls and
      rocks which support this Promenade (due to a happy combination of
      indestructible slate and patient industry) another circular road exists,
      called the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Staircase&rdquo;; this is cut in the rock itself and leads
      to a bridge built across the Nancon by Anne of Brittany. Below this road,
      which forms a third cornice, gardens descend, terrace after terrace, to
      the river, like shelves covered with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parallel with the Promenade, on the other side of the Nancon and across
      its narrow valley, high rock-formations, called the heights of
      Saint-Sulpice, follow the stream and descend in gentle slopes to the great
      valley, where they turn abruptly to the north. Towards the south, where
      the town itself really ends and the faubourg Saint-Leonard begins, the
      Fougeres rock makes a bend, becomes less steep, and turns into the great
      valley, following the course of the river, which it hems in between itself
      and the heights of Saint-Sulpice, forming a sort of pass through which the
      water escapes in two streamlets to the Couesnon, into which they fall.
      This pretty group of rocky hills is called the &ldquo;Nid-aux-Crocs&rdquo;; the little
      vale they surround is the &ldquo;Val de Gibarry,&rdquo; the rich pastures of which
      supply the butter known to epicures as that of the &ldquo;Pree-Valaye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the point where the Promenade joins the fortifications is a tower
      called the &ldquo;Tour de Papegaut.&rdquo; Close to this square erection, against the
      side of which the house now occupied by Mademoiselle de Verneuil rested,
      is a wall, partly built by hands and partly formed of the native rock
      where it offered a smooth surface. Here stands a gateway leading to the
      faubourg of Saint-Sulpice and bearing the same name. Above, on a
      breastwork of granite which commands the three valleys, rise the
      battlements and feudal towers of the ancient castle of Fougeres,&mdash;one
      of those enormous erections built by the Dukes of Brittany, with lofty
      walls fifteen feet thick, protected on the east by a pond from which flows
      the Nancon, the waters of which fill its moats, and on the west by the
      inaccessible granite rock on which it stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seen from the Promenade, this magnificent relic of the Middle Ages,
      wrapped in its ivy mantle, adorned with its square or rounded towers, in
      either of which a whole regiment could be quartered,&mdash;the castle, the
      town, and the rock, protected by walls with sheer surfaces, or by the
      glacis of the fortifications, form a huge horseshoe, lined with
      precipices, on which the Bretons have, in course of ages, cut various
      narrow footways. Here and there the rocks push out like architectural
      adornments. Streamlets issue from the fissures, where the roots of stunted
      trees are nourished. Farther on, a few rocky slopes, less perpendicular
      than the rest, afford a scanty pasture for the goats. On all sides
      heather, growing from every crevice, flings its rosy garlands over the
      dark, uneven surface of the ground. At the bottom of this vast funnel the
      little river winds through meadows that are always cool and green, lying
      softly like a carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the castle and among the granite boulders is a church dedicated to
      Saint-Sulpice, whose name is given to the suburb which lies across the
      Nancon. This suburb, flung as it were to the bottom of a precipice, and
      its church, the spire of which does not rise to the height of the rocks
      which threaten to crush it, are picturesquely watered by several affluents
      of the Nancon, shaded by trees and brightened by gardens. The whole region
      of Fougeres, its suburbs, its churches, and the hills of Saint-Sulpice are
      surrounded by the heights of Rille, which form part of a general range of
      mountains enclosing the broad valley of Couesnon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the chief features of this landscape, the principal
      characteristic of which is a rugged wildness softened by smiling
      accidents, by a happy blending of the finest works of men&rsquo;s hands with the
      capricious lay of a land full of unexpected contrasts, by a something,
      hardly to be explained, which surprises, astonishes, and puzzles. In no
      other part of France can the traveller meet with such grandiose contrasts
      as those offered by the great basin of the Couesnon, and the valleys
      hidden among the rocks of Fougeres and the heights of Rille. Their beauty
      is of that unspeakable kind in which chance triumphs and all the harmonies
      of Nature do their part. The clear, limpid, flowing waters, the mountains
      clothed with the vigorous vegetation of those regions, the sombre rocks,
      the graceful buildings, the fortifications raised by nature, and the
      granite towers built by man; combined with all the artifices of light and
      shade, with the contrasts of the varieties of foliage, with the groups of
      houses where an active population swarms, with the lonely barren places
      where the granite will not suffer even the lichen to fasten on its
      surface, in short, with all the ideas we ask a landscape to possess: grace
      and awfulness, poesy with its renascent magic, sublime pictures,
      delightful ruralities,&mdash;all these are here; it is Brittany in bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tower called the Papegaut, against which the house now occupied by
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil rested, has its base at the very bottom of the
      precipice, and rises to the esplanade which forms the cornice or terrace
      before the church of Saint-Leonard. From Marie&rsquo;s house, which was open on
      three sides, could be seen the horseshoe (which begins at the tower
      itself), the winding valley of the Nancon, and the square of
      Saint-Leonard. It is one of a group of wooden buildings standing parallel
      with the western side of the church, with which they form an alley-way,
      the farther end of which opens on a steep street skirting the church and
      leading to the gate of Saint-Leonard, along which Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      now made her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie naturally avoided entering the square of the church which was then
      above her, and turned towards the Promenade. The magnificence of the scene
      which met her eyes silenced for a moment the tumult of her passions. She
      admired the vast trend of the valley, which her eyes took in, from the
      summit of La Pelerine to the plateau where the main road to Vitry passes;
      then her eyes rested on the Nid-aux-Crocs and the winding gorges of the
      Val de Gibarry, the crests of which were bathed in the misty glow of the
      setting sun. She was almost frightened by the depth of the valley of the
      Nancon, the tallest poplars of which scarcely reached to the level of the
      gardens below the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase. At this time of day the smoke from
      the houses in the suburbs and in the valleys made a vapor in the air,
      through which the various objects had a bluish tinge; the brilliant colors
      of the day were beginning to fade; the firmament took a pearly tone; the
      moon was casting its veil of light into the ravine; all things tended to
      plunge the soul into reverie and bring back the memory of those beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the scene before her was powerless to hold Marie&rsquo;s thoughts.
      In vain did the setting sun cast its gold-dust and its crimson sheets to
      the depths of the river and along the meadows and over the graceful
      buildings strewn among the rocks; she stood immovable, gazing at the
      heights of the Mont Saint-Sulpice. The frantic hope which had led her to
      the Promenade was miraculously realized. Among the gorse and bracken which
      grew upon those heights she was certain that she recognized, in spite of
      the goatskins which they wore, a number of the guests at La Vivetiere, and
      among them the Gars, whose every moment became vivid to her eyes in the
      softened light of the sinking sun. A few steps back of the ground of men
      she distinguished her enemy, Madame du Gua. For a moment Marie fancied
      that she dreamed, but her rival&rsquo;s hatred soon proved to her that the dream
      was a living one. The attention she was giving to the least little gesture
      of the marquis prevented her from observing the care with which Madame du
      Gua aimed a musket at her. But a shot which woke the echoes of the
      mountains, and a ball that whistled past her warned Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil of her rival&rsquo;s determination. &ldquo;She sends me her card,&rdquo; thought
      Marie, smiling. Instantly a &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; echoing from sentry to sentry,
      from the castle to the Porte Saint-Leonard, proved to the Chouans the
      alertness of the Blues, inasmuch as the least accessible of their ramparts
      was so well guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she&mdash;and he,&rdquo; muttered Marie to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To seek the marquis, follow his steps and overtake him, was a thought that
      flashed like lightning through her mind. &ldquo;I have no weapon!&rdquo; she cried.
      She remembered that on leaving Paris she had flung into a trunk an elegant
      dagger formerly belonging to a sultana, which she had jestingly brought
      with her to the theatre of war, as some persons take note-books in which
      to jot down their travelling ideas; she was less attracted by the prospect
      of shedding blood than by the pleasure of wearing a pretty weapon studded
      with precious stones, and playing with a blade that was stainless. Three
      days earlier she had deeply regretted having put this dagger in a trunk,
      when to escape her enemies at La Vivetiere she had thought for a moment of
      killing herself. She now returned to the house, found the weapon, put it
      in her belt, wrapped a large shawl round her shoulders and a black lace
      scarf about her hair, and covered her head with one of those broad-brimmed
      hats distinctive of Chouans which belonged to a servant of the house.
      Then, with the presence of mind which excited passions often give, she
      took the glove which Marche-a-Terre had given her as a safeguard, and
      saying, in reply to Francine&rsquo;s terrible looks, &ldquo;I would seek him in hell,&rdquo;
       she returned to the Promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gars was still at the same place, but alone. By the direction of his
      telescope he seemed to be examining with the careful attention of a
      commander the various paths across the Nancon, the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase, and
      the road leading through the Porte Saint-Sulpice and round the church of
      that name, where it meets the high-road under range of the guns at the
      castle. Mademoiselle de Verneuil took one of the little paths made by
      goats and their keepers leading down from the Promenade, reached the
      Staircase, then the bottom of the ravine, crossed the Nancon and the
      suburb, and divining like a bird in the desert her right course among the
      dangerous precipices of the Mont Saint-Sulpice, she followed a slippery
      track defined upon the granite, and in spite of the prickly gorse and
      reeds and loose stones which hindered her, she climbed the steep ascent
      with an energy greater perhaps than that of a man,&mdash;the energy
      momentarily possessed by a woman under the influence of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night overtook her as she endeavored by the failing moonlight to make out
      the path the marquis must have taken; an obstinate quest without reward,
      for the dead silence about her was sufficient proof of the withdrawal of
      the Chouans and their leader. This effort of passion collapsed with the
      hope that inspired it. Finding herself alone, after nightfall, in a
      hostile country, she began to reflect; and Hulot&rsquo;s advice, together with
      the recollection of Madame du Gua&rsquo;s attempt, made her tremble with fear.
      The stillness of the night, so deep in mountain regions, enabled her to
      hear the fall of every leaf even at a distance, and these slight sounds
      vibrated on the air as though to give a measure of the silence or the
      solitude. The wind was blowing across the heights and sweeping away the
      clouds with violence, producing an alternation of shadows and light, the
      effect of which increased her fears, and gave fantastic and terrifying
      semblances to the most harmless objects. She turned her eyes to the houses
      of Fougeres, where the domestic lights were burning like so many earthly
      stars, and she presently saw distinctly the tower of Papegaut. She was but
      a very short distance from her own house, but within that space was the
      ravine. She remembered the declivities by which she had come, and wondered
      if there were not more risk in attempting to return to Fougeres than in
      following out the purpose which had brought her. She reflected that the
      marquis&rsquo;s glove would surely protect her from the Chouans, and that Madame
      du Gua was the only enemy to be really feared. With this idea in her mind,
      Marie clasped her dagger, and tried to find the way to a country house the
      roofs of which she had noticed as she climbed Saint-Sulpice; but she
      walked slowly, for she suddenly became aware of the majestic solemnity
      which oppresses a solitary being in the night time in the midst of wild
      scenery, where lofty mountains nod their heads like assembled giants. The
      rustle of her gown, caught by the brambles, made her tremble more than
      once, and more than once she hastened her steps only to slacken them again
      as she thought her last hour had come. Before long matters assumed an
      aspect which the boldest men could not have faced without alarm, and which
      threw Mademoiselle de Verneuil into the sort of terror that so affects the
      very springs of life that all things become excessive, weakness as well as
      strength. The feeblest beings will then do deeds of amazing power; the
      strongest go mad with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie heard at a short distance a number of strange sounds, distinct yet
      vague, indicative of confusion and tumult, fatiguing to the ear which
      tried to distinguish them. They came from the ground, which seemed to
      tremble beneath the feet of a multitude of marching men. A momentary
      clearness in the sky enabled her to perceive at a little distance long
      files of hideous figures waving like ears of corn and gliding like
      phantoms; but she scarcely saw them, for darkness fell again, like a black
      curtain, and hid the fearful scene which seemed to her full of yellow,
      dazzling eyes. She turned hastily and ran to the top of a bank to escape
      meeting three of these horrible figures who were coming towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt a cold wind as it rushed past me,&rdquo; replied a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I smelt a damp and graveyard smell,&rdquo; said the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it white?&rdquo; asked the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should only <i>he</i> come back out of all those we left dead at La
      Pelerine?&rdquo; said the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed?&rdquo; replied the third. &ldquo;Why do the Sacre-Coeur men have the
      preference? Well, at any rate, I&rsquo;d rather die without confession than
      wander about as he does, without eating or drinking, and no blood in his
      body or flesh on his bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation, or rather this fearful cry, issued from the group as the
      three Chouans pointed to the slender form and pallid face of Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil, who fled away with terrified rapidity without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; &ldquo;There!&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Can you see him?&rdquo; These cries reverberated like the monotonous murmur of
      waves upon a shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil walked bravely in the direction of the house she
      had seen, and soon came in sight of a number of persons, who all fled away
      at her approach with every sign of panic fear. She felt impelled to
      advance by a mysterious power which coerced her; the lightness of her
      body, which seemed to herself inexplicable, was another source of terror.
      These forms which rose in masses at her approach, as if from the ground on
      which she trod, uttered moans which were scarcely human. At last she
      reached, not without difficulty, a trampled garden, the hedges and fences
      of which were broken down. Stopped by a sentry, she showed the glove. The
      moon lighted her face, and the muzzle of the gun already pointed at her
      was dropped by the Chouan, who uttered a hoarse cry, which echoed through
      the place. She now saw large buildings, where a few lighted windows showed
      the rooms that were occupied, and presently reached the walls without
      further hindrance. Through the window into which she looked, she saw
      Madame du Gua and the leaders who were convoked at La Vivetiere.
      Bewildered at the sight, also by the conviction of her danger, she turned
      hastily to a little opening protected by iron bars, and saw in a long
      vaulted hall the marquis, alone and gloomy, within six feet of her. The
      reflection of the fire, before which he was sitting in a clumsy chair,
      lighted his face with a vacillating ruddy glow that gave the character of
      a vision to the scene. Motionless and trembling, the girl stood clinging
      to the bars, to catch his words if he spoke. Seeing him so depressed,
      disheartened, and pale, she believed herself to be the cause of his
      sadness. Her anger changed to pity, her pity to tenderness, and she
      suddenly knew that it was not revenge alone which had brought her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis rose, turned his head, and stood amazed when he saw, as if in
      a cloud, Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s face; then he shook his head with a
      gesture of impatience and contempt, exclaiming: &ldquo;Must I forever see the
      face of that devil, even when awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This utter contempt for her forced a half-maddened laugh from the unhappy
      girl which made the young leader quiver. He sprang to the window, but
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was gone. She heard the steps of a man behind
      her, which she supposed to be those of the marquis, and, to escape him,
      she knew no obstacles; she would have scaled walls and flown through air;
      she would have found and followed a path to hell sooner than have seen
      again, in flaming letters on the forehead of that man, &ldquo;I despise you,&rdquo;&mdash;words
      which an inward voice sounded in her soul with the noise of a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking a short distance without knowing where she went, she
      stopped, conscious of a damp exhalation. Alarmed by the sound of voices,
      she went down some steps which led into a cellar. As she reached the last
      of them, she stopped to listen and discover the direction her pursuers
      might take. Above the sounds from the outside, which were somewhat loud,
      she could hear within the lugubrious moans of a human being, which added
      to her terror. Rays of light coming down the steps made her fear that this
      retreat was only too well known to her enemies, and, to escape them, she
      summoned fresh energy. Some moments later, after recovering her composure
      of mind, it was difficult for her to conceive by what means she had been
      able to climb a little wall, in a recess of which she was now hidden. She
      took no notice at first of the cramped position in which she was, but
      before long the pain of it became intolerable, for she was bending double
      under the arched opening of a vault, like the crouching Venus which
      ignorant persons attempt to squeeze into too narrow a niche. The wall,
      which was rather thick and built of granite, formed a low partition
      between the stairway and the cellar whence the groans were issuing.
      Presently she saw an individual, clothed in a goatskin, enter the cave
      beneath her, and move about, without making any sign of eager search.
      Impatient to discover if she had any chance of safety, Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil waited with anxiety till the light brought by the new-comer
      lighted the whole cave, where she could partly distinguish a formless but
      living mass which was trying to reach a part of the wall, with violent and
      repeated jerks, something like those of a carp lying out of water on a
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small pine torch threw its blue and hazy light into the cave. In spite
      of the gloomy poetic effects which Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s imagination
      cast about this vaulted chamber, which was echoing to the sounds of a
      pitiful prayer, she was obliged to admit that the place was nothing more
      than an underground kitchen, evidently long abandoned. When the formless
      mass was distinguishable it proved to be a short and very fat man, whose
      limbs were carefully bound before he had been left lying on the damp stone
      floor of the kitchen by those who had seized him. When he saw the
      new-comer approach him with a torch in one hand and a fagot of sticks in
      the other, the captive gave a dreadful groan, which so wrought upon the
      sensibilities of Mademoiselle de Verneuil that she forgot her own terror
      and despair and the cramped position of her limbs, which were growing
      numb. But she made a great effort and remained still. The Chouan flung the
      sticks into the fireplace, after trying the strength of an old crane which
      was fastened to a long iron bar; then he set fire to the wood with his
      torch. Marie saw with terror that the man was the same Pille-Miche to whom
      her rival had delivered her, and whose figure, illuminated by the flame,
      was like that of the little boxwood men so grotesquely carved in Germany.
      The moans of his prisoner produced a broad grin upon features that were
      ribbed with wrinkles and tanned by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said to his victim, &ldquo;that we Christians keep our promises,
      which you don&rsquo;t. That fire is going to thaw out your legs and tongue and
      hands. Hey! hey! I don&rsquo;t see a dripping-pan to put under your feet; they
      are so fat the grease may put out the fire. Your house must be badly
      furnished if it can&rsquo;t give its master all he wants to warm him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim uttered a sharp cry, as if he hoped someone would hear him
      through the ceiling and come to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! sing away, Monsieur d&rsquo;Orgemont; they are all asleep upstairs, and
      Marche-a-Terre is just behind me; he&rsquo;ll shut the cellar door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking Pille-Miche was sounding with the butt-end of his musket
      the mantel-piece of the chimney, the tiles of the floor, the walls and the
      ovens, to discover, if possible, where the miser hid his gold. This search
      was made with such adroitness that d&rsquo;Orgemont kept silence, as if he
      feared to have been betrayed by some frightened servant; for, though he
      trusted his secrets to no one, his habits gave plenty of ground for
      logical deductions. Pille-Miche turned several times sharply to look at
      his victim, as children do when they try to guess, by the conscious
      expression of the comrade who has hidden an article, whether they are
      nearer to or farther away from it. D&rsquo;Orgemont pretended to be alarmed when
      the Chouan tapped the ovens, which sounded hollow, and seemed to wish to
      play upon his eager credulity. Just then three other Chouans rushed down
      the steps and entered the kitchen. Seeing Marche-a-Terre among them
      Pille-Miche discontinued his search, after casting upon d&rsquo;Orgemont a look
      that conveyed the wrath of his balked covetousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie Lambrequin has come to life!&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre, proclaiming by
      his manner that all other interests were of no account beside this great
      piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, &ldquo;he took the sacrament so often;
      the good God belonged to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; observed Mene-a-Bien, &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t stand him in anything at his
      death. He hadn&rsquo;t received absolution before the affair at La Pelerine. He
      had cheapened Goguelu&rsquo;s daughter, and was living in mortal sin. The Abbe
      Gudin said he&rsquo;d have to roam round two months as a ghost before he could
      come to life. We saw him pass us,&mdash;he was pale, he was cold, he was
      thin, he smelt of the cemetery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his Reverence says that if a ghost gets hold of a living man he can
      force him to be his companion,&rdquo; said the fourth Chouan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grotesque appearance of this last speaker drew Marche-a-Terre from the
      pious reflections he had been making on the accomplishment of this miracle
      of coming to life which, according to the Abbe Gudin would happen to every
      true defender of religion and the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Galope-Chopine,&rdquo; he said to the fourth man gravely, &ldquo;what comes
      of omitting even the smallest duty commanded by our holy religion. It is a
      warning to us, given by Saint Anne of Auray, to be rigorous with ourselves
      for the slightest sin. Your cousin Pille-Miche has asked the Gars to give
      you the surveillance of Fougeres, and the Gars consents, and you&rsquo;ll be
      well paid&mdash;but you know with what flour we bake a traitor&rsquo;s bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know why I tell you that. Some say you like cider and gambling,
      but you can&rsquo;t play heads or tails now, remember; you must belong to us
      only, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your leave, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, cider and stakes are two good
      things which don&rsquo;t hinder a man&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my cousin commits any folly,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, &ldquo;it will be out of
      ignorance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any way he commits it, if harm comes,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, in a voice
      which made the arched roof tremble, &ldquo;my gun won&rsquo;t miss him. You will
      answer for him to me,&rdquo; he added, turning to Pille-Miche; &ldquo;for if he does
      wrong I shall take it out on the thing that fills your goatskin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, with all due respect,&rdquo; said Galope-Chopine,
      &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you sometimes taken a counterfeit Chouan for a real one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre in a curt tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let that happen in
      your case, or I&rsquo;ll cut you in two like a turnip. As to the emissaries of
      the Gars, they all carry his glove, but since that affair at La Vivetiere
      the Grande Garce has added a green ribbon to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pille Miche nudged his comrade by the elbow and showed him d&rsquo;Orgemont, who
      was pretending to be asleep; but Pille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre both knew
      by experience that no one ever slept by the corner of their fire, and
      though the last words said to Galope-Chopine were almost whispered, they
      must have been heard by the victim, and the four Chouans looked at him
      fixedly, thinking perhaps that fear had deprived him of his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, at a slight sign from Marche-a-Terre, Pille-Miche pulled off
      d&rsquo;Orgemont&rsquo;s shoes and stockings, Mene-a-Bien and Galope-Chopine seized
      him round the body and carried him to the fire. Then Marche-a-Terre took
      one of the thongs that tied the fagots and fastened the miser&rsquo;s feet to
      the crane. These actions and the horrible celerity with which they were
      done brought cries from the victim, which became heart-rending when
      Pille-Miche gathered the burning sticks under his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, my good friends,&rdquo; screamed d&rsquo;Orgemont, &ldquo;you hurt me, you kill
      me! I&rsquo;m a Christian like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie in your throat!&rdquo; replied Marche-a-Terre. &ldquo;Your brother denied
      God; and as for you, you bought the abbey of Juvigny. The Abbe Gudin says
      we can roast apostates when we find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my brothers in God, I don&rsquo;t refuse to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We gave you two weeks, and it is now two months, and Galope-Chopine here
      hasn&rsquo;t received the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you received any of it, Galope-Chopine?&rdquo; asked the miser, in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of it, Monsieur d&rsquo;Orgemont,&rdquo; replied Galope-Chopine, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries, which had sunk into groans, continuous as the rattle in a dying
      throat, now began again with dreadful violence. Accustomed to such scenes,
      the four Chouans looked at d&rsquo;Orgemont, who was twisting and howling, so
      coolly that they seemed like travellers watching before an inn fire till
      the roast meat was done enough to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying, I&rsquo;m dying!&rdquo; cried the victim, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t get my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these agonizing cries, Pille-Miche saw that the fire did not
      yet scorch the skin; he drew the sticks cleverly together so as to make a
      slight flame. On this d&rsquo;Orgemont called out in a quavering voice: &ldquo;My
      friends, unbind me! How much do you want? A hundred crowns&mdash;a
      thousand crowns&mdash;ten thousand crowns&mdash;a hundred thousand crowns&mdash;I
      offer you two hundred thousand crowns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice became so lamentable that Mademoiselle de Verneuil forgot her
      own danger and uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo; asked Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans looked about them with terrified eyes. These men, so brave in
      fight, were unable to face a ghost. Pille-Miche alone continued to listen
      to the promises which the flames were now extracting from his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred thousand crowns&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll give them,&rdquo; cried the
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are they?&rdquo; answered Pille-Miche, tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the first apple-tree&mdash;Holy Virgin! at the bottom of the garden
      to the left&mdash;you are brigands&mdash;thieves! Ah! I&rsquo;m dying&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      ten thousand francs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francs! we don&rsquo;t want francs,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre; &ldquo;those Republican
      coins have pagan figures which oughtn&rsquo;t to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not francs, they are good louis d&rsquo;or. But oh! undo me, unbind
      me! I&rsquo;ve told you where my life is&mdash;my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The four Chouans looked at each other as if thinking which of their number
      they could trust sufficiently to disinter the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cannibal cruelty of the scene so horrified Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      that she could bear it no longer. Though doubtful whether the role of
      ghost, which her pale face and the Chouan superstitions evidently assigned
      to her, would carry her safely through the danger, she called out,
      courageously, &ldquo;Do you not fear God&rsquo;s anger? Unbind him, brutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans raised their heads and saw in the air above them two eyes
      which shone like stars, and they fled, terrified. Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      sprang into the kitchen, ran to d&rsquo;Orgemont, and pulled him so violently
      from the crane that the thong broke. Then with the blade of her dagger she
      cut the cords which bound him. When the miser was free and on his feet,
      the first expression of his face was a painful but sardonic grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apple-tree! yes, go to the apple-tree, you brigands,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ho, ho!
      this is the second time I&rsquo;ve fooled them. They won&rsquo;t get a third chance at
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he caught Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s hand, drew her under the
      mantel-shelf to the back of the hearth in a way to avoid disturbing the
      fire, which covered only a small part of it; then he touched a spring; the
      iron back was lifted, and when their enemies returned to the kitchen the
      heavy door of the hiding-place had already fallen noiselessly.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil then understood the carp-like movements she had
      seen the miser making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ghost has taken the Blue with him,&rdquo; cried the voice of
      Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fright of the Chouans must have been great, for the words were
      followed by a stillness so profound that d&rsquo;Orgemont and his companion
      could hear them muttering to themselves: &ldquo;Ave, sancta Anna Auriaca gratia
      plena, Dominus tecum,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are praying, the fools!&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Orgemont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! are you not afraid they will discover us?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil, checking her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s laugh dissipated her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That iron back is set in a wall of granite two feet thick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
      can hear them, but they can&rsquo;t hear us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took the hand of his preserver and placed it near a crevice
      through which a current of fresh air was blowing. She then perceived that
      the opening was made in the shaft of the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ai! ai!&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Orgemont. &ldquo;The devil! how my legs smart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouans, having finished their prayer, departed, and the old miser
      again caught the hand of his companion and helped her to climb some narrow
      winding steps cut in the granite wall. When they had mounted some twenty
      of these steps the gleam of a lamp dimly lighted their heads. The miser
      stopped, turned to his companion, examined her face as if it were a bank
      note he was doubtful about cashing, and heaved a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By bringing you here,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;I have paid
      you in full for the service you did me; I don&rsquo;t see why I should give you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I ask nothing of you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, and also, perhaps, the disdainful expression on the beautiful
      face, reassured the old man, for he answered, not without a sigh, &ldquo;Ah! if
      you take it that way, I have gone too far not to continue on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He politely assisted Marie to climb a few more steps rather strangely
      constructed, and half willingly, half reluctantly, ushered her into a
      small closet about four feet square, lighted by a lamp hanging from the
      ceiling. It was easy to see that the miser had made preparations to spend
      more than one day in this retreat if the events of the civil war compelled
      him to hide himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t brush against that wall, you might whiten yourself,&rdquo; said
      d&rsquo;Orgemont suddenly, as he hurriedly put his hand between the girl&rsquo;s shawl
      and the stones which seemed to have been lately whitewashed. The old man&rsquo;s
      action produced quite another effect from that he intended. Marie looked
      about her and saw in one corner a sort of projection, the shape of which
      forced from her a cry of terror, for she fancied it was that of a human
      being standing erect and mortared into the wall. D&rsquo;Orgemont made a violent
      sign to her to hold her tongue, and his little eyes of a porcelain blue
      showed as much fear as those of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! do you think I murdered him? It is the body of my brother,&rdquo; and the
      old man gave a lugubrious sigh. &ldquo;He was the first sworn-in priest; and
      this was the only asylum where he was safe against the fury of the Chouans
      and the other priests. He was my elder brother, and he alone had the
      patience to each me the decimal calculus. Oh! he was a good priest! He was
      economical and laid by money. It is four years since he died; I don&rsquo;t know
      what was the matter with him; perhaps it was that priests are so in the
      habit of kneeling down to pray that he couldn&rsquo;t get accustomed to standing
      upright here as I do. I walled him up there; <i>they&rsquo;d</i> have dug him up
      elsewhere. Some day perhaps I can put him in holy ground, as he used to
      call it,&mdash;poor man, he only took the oath out of fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tear rolled from the hard eyes of the little old man, whose rusty wig
      suddenly seemed less hideous to the girl, and she turned her eyes
      respectfully away from his distress. But, in spite of these tender
      reminiscences, d&rsquo;Orgemont kept on saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near the wall, you
      might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes never ceased to watch hers, hoping thus to prevent her from
      examining too closely the walls of the closet, where the close air was
      scarcely enough to inflate the lungs. Marie succeeded, however, in getting
      a sufficiently good look in spite of her Argus, and she came to the
      conclusion that the strange protuberances in the walls were neither more
      nor less than sacks of coin which the miser had placed there and plastered
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old d&rsquo;Orgemont was now in a state of almost grotesque bewilderment. The
      pain in his legs, the terror he felt at seeing a human being in the midst
      of his hoards, could be read in every wrinkle of his face, and yet at the
      same time his eyes expressed, with unaccustomed fire, a lively emotion
      excited in him by the presence of his liberator, whose white and rosy
      cheek invited kisses, and whose velvety black eye sent waves of blood to
      his heart, so hot that he was much in doubt whether they were signs of
      life or of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you married?&rdquo; he asked, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a little something,&rdquo; he continued, heaving a sigh, &ldquo;though I am
      not so rich as people think for. A young girl like you must love diamonds,
      trinkets, carriages, money. I&rsquo;ve got all that to give&mdash;after my
      death. Hey! if you will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyes were so shrewd and betrayed such calculation in this
      ephemeral love that Mademoiselle de Verneuil, as she shook her head in
      sign of refusal, felt that his desire to marry her was solely to bury his
      secret in another himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she said, with a look of scorn which made him satisfied and angry
      both; &ldquo;money is nothing to me. You would be three times as rich as you
      are, if you had all the gold that I have refused&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near that wall, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hear a voice,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it echoes through that wall,&mdash;a
      voice that is more to me than all your riches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the miser could stop her Marie had laid her hand on a small colored
      engraving of Louis XV. on horseback; to her amazement it turned, and she
      saw, in a room beneath her, the Marquis de Montauran, who was loading a
      musket. The opening, hidden by a little panel on which the picture was
      gummed, seemed to form some opening in the ceiling of the adjoining
      chamber, which, no doubt, was the bedroom of the royalist general.
      D&rsquo;Orgemont closed the opening with much precaution, and looked at the girl
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word if you love your life. You haven&rsquo;t thrown your
      grappling-iron on a worthless building. Do you know that the Marquis de
      Montauran is worth more than one hundred thousand francs a year from lands
      which have not yet been confiscated? And I read in the Primidi de
      l&rsquo;Ille-et-Vilaine a decree of the Consuls putting an end to confiscation.
      Ha! ha! you&rsquo;ll think the Gars a prettier fellow than ever, won&rsquo;t you? Your
      eyes are shining like two new louis d&rsquo;or.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s face was, indeed, keenly excited when she heard
      that well-known voice so near her. Since she had been standing there,
      erect, in the midst as it were of a silver mine, the spring of her mind,
      held down by these strange events, recovered itself. She seemed to have
      formed some sinister resolution and to perceive a means of carrying it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no return from such contempt,&rdquo; she was saying to herself; &ldquo;and
      if he cannot love me, I will kill him&mdash;no other woman shall have
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, abbe, no!&rdquo; cried the young chief, in a loud voice which was heard
      through the panel, &ldquo;it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; replied the Abbe Gudin, haughtily; &ldquo;you will
      scandalize all Brittany if you give that ball at Saint James. It is
      preaching, not dancing, which will rouse our villagers. Take guns, not
      fiddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abbe, you have sense enough to know that it is not in a general assembly
      of our partisans that I can learn to know these people, or judge of what I
      may be able to undertake with them. A supper is better for examining faces
      than all the spying in the world, of which, by the bye, I have a horror;
      they can be made to talk with glasses in their hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie quivered, as she listened, and conceived the idea of going to the
      ball and there avenging herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take me for an idiot with your sermon against dancing?&rdquo; continued
      Montauran. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you yourself dance a reed if it would restore your
      order under its new name of Fathers of the Faith? Don&rsquo;t you know that
      Bretons come away from the mass and go to dancing? Are you aware that
      Messieurs Hyde de Neuville and d&rsquo;Andigne had a conference, five days ago,
      with the First Consul, on the question of restoring his Majesty Louis
      XVIII.? Ah, monsieur, the princes are deceived as to the true state of
      France. The devotions which uphold them are solely those of rank. Abbe, if
      I have set my feet in blood, at least I will not go into it to my middle
      without full knowledge of what I do. I am devoted to the king, but not to
      four hot-heads, not to a man crippled with debt like Rifoel, not to
      &lsquo;chauffeurs,&rsquo; not to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say frankly, monsieur, not to abbes who force contributions on the
      highway to carry on the war,&rdquo; retorted the Abbe Gudin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not say it?&rdquo; replied the marquis, sharply; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll say,
      further, that the great and heroic days of La Vendee are over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis, we can perform miracles without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like that of Marie Lambrequin, whom I hear you have brought to
      life,&rdquo; said the marquis, smiling. &ldquo;Come, come, let us have no rancor,
      abbe. I know that you run all risks and would shoot a Blue as readily as
      you say an <i>oremus</i>. God willing, I hope to make you assist with a
      mitre on your head at the king&rsquo;s coronation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last remark must have had some magic power, for the click of a musket
      was heard as the abbe exclaimed, &ldquo;I have fifty cartridges in my pocket,
      monsieur le marquis, and my life is the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a debtor of mine,&rdquo; whispered the usurer to Marie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the
      five or six hundred crowns he has borrowed, but a debt of blood which I
      hope to make him pay. He can never suffer as much evil as I wish him, the
      damned Jesuit! He swore the death of my brother, and raised the country
      against him. Why? Because the poor man was afraid of the new laws.&rdquo; Then,
      after applying his ear to another part of his hiding-place, he added,
      &ldquo;They are all decamping, those brigands. I suppose they are going to do
      some other miracle elsewhere. I only hope they won&rsquo;t bid me good-bye as
      they did the last time, by setting fire to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of about half an hour, during which time the usurer and
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil looked at each other as if they were studying a
      picture, the coarse, gruff voice of Galope-Chopine was heard saying, in a
      muffled tone: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no longer any danger, Monsieur d&rsquo;Orgemont. But this
      time, you must allow that I have earned my thirty crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the miser to Marie, &ldquo;swear to shut your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil placed one hand over her eyelids; but for greater
      security d&rsquo;Orgemont blew out the lamp, took his liberator by the hand, and
      helped her to make seven or eight steps along a difficult passage. At the
      end of some minutes he gently removed her hand, and she found herself in
      the very room the Marquis de Montauran had just quitted, and which was, in
      fact, the miser&rsquo;s own bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you can safely go now. Don&rsquo;t look about
      you that way. I dare say you have no money with you. Here are ten crowns;
      they are a little shaved, but they&rsquo;ll pass. When you leave the garden you
      will see a path that leads straight to the town, or, as they say now, the
      district. But the Chouans will be at Fougeres, and it is to be presumed
      that you can&rsquo;t get back there at once. You may want some safe place to
      hide in. Remember what I say to you, but don&rsquo;t make use of it unless in
      some great emergency. You will see on the road which leads to
      Nid-aux-Crocs through the Val de Gibarry, a farmhouse belonging to Cibot&mdash;otherwise
      called Galope-Chopine. Go in, and say to his wife: &lsquo;Good-day, Becaniere,&rsquo; 
      and Barbette will hide you. If Galope-Chopine discovers you he will either
      take you for the ghost, if it is dark, or ten crowns will master him if it
      is light. Adieu, our account is squared. But if you choose,&rdquo; he added,
      waving his hand about him, &ldquo;all this is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil gave the strange old man a look of thanks, and
      succeeded in extracting a sigh from him, expressing a variety of emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will of course return me my ten crowns; and please remark that I ask
      no interest. You can pay them to my credit with Maitre Patrat, the notary
      at Fougeres, who would draw our marriage contract if you consented to be
      mine. Adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; she said, smiling and waving her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever want money,&rdquo; he called after her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend it to you at
      five per cent; yes, only five&mdash;did I say five?&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s gone!
      That girl looks to me like a good one; nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll change the
      secret opening of my chimney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a twelve-pound loaf and a ham, and returned to his
      hiding-place.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As Mademoiselle de Verneuil walked through the country she seemed to
      breathe a new life. The freshness of the night revived her after the fiery
      experience of the last few hours. She tried to follow the path explained
      to her by d&rsquo;Orgemont, but the darkness became so dense after the moon had
      gone down that she was forced to walk hap-hazard, blindly. Presently the
      fear of falling down some precipice seized her and saved her life, for she
      stopped suddenly, fancying the ground would disappear before her if she
      made another step. A cool breeze lifting her hair, the murmur of the
      river, and her instinct all combined to warn her that she was probably on
      the verge of the Saint-Sulpice rocks. She slipped her arm around a tree
      and waited for dawn with keen anxiety, for she heard a noise of arms and
      horses and human voices; she was grateful to the darkness which saved her
      from the Chouans, who were evidently, as the miser had said, surrounding
      Fougeres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like fires lit at night as signals of liberty, a few gleams, faintly
      crimsoned, began to show upon the summits, while the bases of the
      mountains still retained the bluish tints which contrasted with the rosy
      clouds that were floating in the valley. Soon a ruby disk rose slowly on
      the horizon and the skies greeted it; the varied landscape, the bell-tower
      of Saint-Leonard, the rocks, the meadows buried in shadow, all insensibly
      reappeared, and the trees on the summits were defined against the skies in
      the rising glow. The sun freed itself with a graceful spring from the
      ribbons of flame and ochre and sapphire. Its vivid light took level lines
      from hill to hill and flowed into the vales. The dusk dispersed, day
      mastered Nature. A sharp breeze crisped the air, the birds sang, life
      wakened everywhere. But the girl had hardly time to cast her eyes over the
      whole of this wondrous landscape before, by a phenomenon not infrequent in
      these cool regions, the mists spread themselves in sheets, filled the
      valleys, and rose to the tops of the mountains, burying the great valley
      beneath a mantle of snow. Mademoiselle de Verneuil fancied for a moment
      she saw a <i>mer de glace</i>, like those of the Alps. Then the vaporous
      atmosphere rolled like the waves of ocean, lifted impenetrable billows
      which softly swayed, undulated, and were violently whirled, catching from
      the sun&rsquo;s rays a vivid rosy tint, and showing here and there in their
      depths the transparencies of a lake of molten silver. Suddenly the north
      wind swept this phantasmagoric scene and scattered the mists which laid a
      dew full of oxygen on the meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was now able to distinguish a dark mass of men on
      the rocks of Fougeres. Seven or eight hundred Chouans were running like
      ants through the suburb of Saint-Sulpice. The sleeping town would
      certainly have been overpowered in spite of its fortifications and its old
      gray towers, if Hulot had not been alert. A battery, concealed on a height
      at the farther end of the basin formed by the ramparts, replied to the
      first fire of the Chouans by taking them diagonally on the road to the
      castle. The balls swept the road. Then a company of Blues made a sortie
      from the Saint-Sulpice gate, profited by the surprise of the royalists to
      form in line upon the high-road, and poured a murderous fire upon them.
      The Chouans made no attempt to resist, seeing that the ramparts of the
      castle were covered with soldiers, and that the guns of the fortress
      sufficiently protected the Republican advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, however, other Chouans, masters of the little valley of the
      Nancon, had swarmed up the rocks and reached the Promenade, which was soon
      covered with goatskins, giving it to Marie&rsquo;s eyes the appearance of a
      thatched roof, brown with age. At the same moment loud reports were heard
      from the part of the town which overlooks the valley of Couesnon.
      Evidently, Fougeres was attacked on all sides and completely surrounded.
      Flames rising on the western side of the rock showed that the Chouans were
      setting fire to the suburbs; but these soon ceased, and a column of black
      smoke which succeeded them showed that the fire was extinguished. Brown
      and white clouds again hid the scene from Mademoiselle de Verneuil, but
      they were clouds of smoke from the fire and powder, which the wind
      dispersed. The Republican commander, as soon as he saw his first orders
      admirably executed, changed the direction of his battery so as to sweep,
      successively, the valley of the Nancon, the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase, and the
      base of the rock of Fougeres. Two guns posted at the gate of Saint-Leonard
      scattered the ant-hill of Chouans who had seized that position, and the
      national guard of the town, rushing in haste to the square before the
      Church, succeeded in dislodging the enemy. The fight lasted only half an
      hour, and cost the Blues a hundred men. The Chouans, beaten on all sides,
      retreated under orders from the Gars, whose bold attempt failed (although
      he did not know this) in consequence of the massacre at La Vivetiere,
      which had brought Hulot secretly and in all haste to Fougeres. The
      artillery had arrived only that evening, and the news had not reached
      Montauran; otherwise, he would certainly have abandoned an enterprise
      which, if it failed, could only have bad results. As soon as he heard the
      guns the marquis knew it would be madness to continue, out of mere pride,
      a surprise which had missed fire. Therefore, not to lose men uselessly, he
      sent at once to all points of the attack, ordering an immediate retreat.
      The commandant, seeing his adversary on the rocks of Saint-Sulpice
      surrounded by a council of men, endeavored to pour a volley upon him; but
      the spot was cleverly selected, and the young leader was out of danger in
      a moment. Hulot now changed parts with his opponent and became the
      aggressor. At the first sign of the Gars&rsquo; intention, the company stationed
      under the walls of the castle were ordered to cut off the Chouans&rsquo; retreat
      by seizing the upper outlet of the valley of the Nancon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her desire for revenge, Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s
      sympathies were with the men commanded by her lover, and she turned
      hastily to see if the other end of the valley were clear for them; but the
      Blues, conquerors no doubt on the opposite side of Fougeres, were
      returning from the valley of Couesnon and taking possession of the
      Nid-aux-Crocs and that portion of the Saint-Sulpice rocks which overhang
      the lower end of the valley of the Nancon. The Chouans, thus hemmed in to
      the narrow fields of the gorge, seemed in danger of perishing to the last
      man, so cleverly and sagaciously were the commandant&rsquo;s measures taken. But
      Hulot&rsquo;s cannon were powerless at these two points; and here, the town of
      Fougeres being quite safe, began one of those desperate struggles which
      denoted the character of Chouan warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil now comprehended the presence of the masses of
      men she had seen as she left the town, the meeting of the leaders at
      d&rsquo;Orgemont&rsquo;s house, and all the other events of the night, wondering how
      she herself had escaped so many dangers. The attack, prompted by
      desperation, interested her so keenly that she stood motionless, watching
      the living pictures as they presented themselves to her sight. Presently
      the struggle at the foot of the mountain had a deeper interest for her.
      Seeing the Blues almost masters of the Chouans, the marquis and his
      friends rushed into the valley of the Nancon to support their men. The
      rocks were now covered with straggling groups of furious combatants
      deciding the question of life or death on a ground and with weapons that
      were more favorable to the Goatskins. Slowly this moving arena widened.
      The Chouans, recovering themselves, gained the rocks, thanks to the shrubs
      and bushes which grew here and there among them. For a moment Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil felt alarmed as she saw, rather late, her enemies swarming
      over the summit and defending the dangerous paths by which alone she could
      descend. Every issue on the mountain was occupied by one or other of the
      two parties; afraid of encountering them she left the tree behind which
      she had been sheltering, and began to run in the direction of the farm
      which d&rsquo;Orgemont had mentioned to her. After running some time on the
      slope of Saint-Sulpice which overlooks the valley of Couesnon she saw a
      cow-shed in the distance, and thought it must belong to the house of
      Galope-Chopine, who had doubtless left his wife at home and alone during
      the fight. Mademoiselle de Verneuil hoped to be able to pass a few hours
      in this retreat until it was possible for her to return to Fougeres
      without danger. According to all appearance Hulot was to triumph. The
      Chouans were retreating so rapidly that she heard firing all about her,
      and the fear of being shot made her hasten to the cottage, the chimney of
      which was her landmark. The path she was following ended at a sort of shed
      covered with a furze-roof, supported by four stout trees with the bark
      still on them. A mud wall formed the back of this shed, under which were a
      cider-mill, a flail to thresh buckwheat, and several agricultural
      implements. She stopped before one of the posts, unwilling to cross the
      dirty bog which formed a sort of courtyard to the house which, in her
      Parisian ignorance, she had taken for a stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin, protected from the north wind by an eminence towering above the
      roof, which rested against it, was not without a poetry of its own; for
      the tender shoots of elms, heather, and various rock-flowers wreathed it
      with garlands. A rustic staircase, constructed between the shed and the
      house, enabled the inhabitants to go to the top of the rock and breathe a
      purer air. On the left, the eminence sloped abruptly down, giving to view
      a series of fields, the first of which belonged no doubt to this farm.
      These fields were like bowers, separated by banks which were planted with
      trees. The road which led to them was barred by the trunk of an old,
      half-rotten tree,&mdash;a Breton method of enclosure the name of which may
      furnish, further on, a digression which will complete the characterization
      of this region. Between the stairway cut in the schist rock and the path
      closed by this old tree, in front of the marsh and beneath the overhanging
      rock, several granite blocks roughly hewn, and piled one upon the other,
      formed the four corners of the cottage and held up the planks,
      cobblestones, and pitch amalgam of which the walls were made. The fact
      that one half of the roof was covered with furze instead of thatch, and
      the other with shingles or bits of board cut into the form of slates,
      showed that the building was in two parts; one half, with a broken hurdle
      for a door, served as a stable, the other half was the dwelling of the
      owner. Though this hut owed to the neighborhood of the town a few
      improvements which were wholly absent from such buildings that were five
      or six miles further off, it showed plainly enough the instability of
      domestic life and habits to which the wars and customs of feudality had
      reduced the serf; even to this day many of the peasants of those parts
      call a seignorial chateau, &ldquo;The Dwelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While examining the place, with an astonishment we can readily conceive,
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil noticed here and there in the filth of the
      courtyard a few bits of granite so placed as to form stepping-stones to
      the house. Hearing the sound of musketry that was evidently coming nearer,
      she jumped from stone to stone, as if crossing a rivulet, to ask shelter.
      The house was closed by a door opening in two parts; the lower one of
      wood, heavy and massive, the upper one a shutter which served as a window.
      In many of the smaller towns of France the shops have the same type of
      door though far more decorated, the lower half possessing a call-bell. The
      door in question opened with a wooden latch worthy of the golden age, and
      the upper part was never closed except at night, for it was the only
      opening through which daylight could enter the room. There was, to be
      sure, a clumsy window, but the glass was thick like the bottom of a
      bottle, and the lead which held the panes in place took so much room that
      the opening seemed intended to intercept the light rather than admit it.
      As soon as Mademoiselle de Verneuil had turned the creaking hinges of the
      lower door she smelt an intolerable ammoniacal odor, and saw that the
      beasts in the stable had kicked through the inner partition which
      separated the stable from the dwelling. The interior of the farmhouse, for
      such it was, did not belie its exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was asking herself how it was possible for human
      beings to live in such habitual filth, when a ragged boy about eight or
      nine years old suddenly presented his fresh and rosy face, with a pair of
      fat cheeks, lively eyes, ivory teeth, and a mass of fair hair, which fell
      in curls upon his half-naked shoulders. His limbs were vigorous, and his
      attitude had the charm of that amazement and naive curiosity which widens
      a child&rsquo;s eyes. The little fellow was a picture of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mother?&rdquo; said Marie, in a gentle voice, stooping to kiss
      him between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving her kiss the child slipped away like an eel, and
      disappeared behind a muck-heap which was piled at the top of a mound
      between the path and the house; for, like many Breton farmers who have a
      system of agriculture that is all their own, Galope-Chopine put his manure
      in an elevated spot, so that by the time it was wanted for use the rains
      had deprived it of all its virtue. Alone for a few minutes, Marie had time
      to make an inventory. The room in which she waited for Barbette was the
      whole house. The most obvious and sumptuous object was a vast fireplace
      with a <i>mantle</i>-shelf of blue granite. The etymology of that word was
      shown by a strip of green serge, edged with a pale-green ribbon, cut in
      scallops, which covered and overhung the whole shelf, on which stood a
      colored plaster cast of the Holy Virgin. On the pedestal of the statuette
      were two lines of a religious poem very popular in Brittany:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am the mother of God,
  Protectress of the sod.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Behind the Virgin a hideous image, daubed with red and blue under pretence
      of painting, represented Saint-Labre. A green serge bed of the shape
      called &ldquo;tomb,&rdquo; a clumsy cradle, a spinning-wheel, common chairs, and a
      carved chest on which lay utensils, were about the whole of
      Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s domestic possessions. In front of the window stood a
      chestnut table flanked by two benches of the same wood, to which the
      sombre light coming through the thick panes gave the tone of mahogany. An
      immense cask of cider, under the bung of which Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      noticed a pool of yellow mud, which had decomposed the flooring, although
      it was made of scraps of granite conglomerated in clay, proved that the
      master of the house had a right to his Chouan name, and that the pints
      galloped down either his own throat or that of his friends. Two enormous
      jugs full of cider stood on the table. Marie&rsquo;s attention, caught at first
      by the innumerable spider&rsquo;s-webs which hung from the roof, was fixing
      itself on these pitchers when the noise of fighting, growing more and more
      distinct, impelled her to find a hiding-place, without waiting for the
      woman of the house, who, however, appeared at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Becaniere,&rdquo; said Marie, restraining a smile at the
      appearance of a person who bore some resemblance to the heads which
      architects attach to window-casings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you come from d&rsquo;Orgemont?&rdquo; answered Barbette, in a tone that was far
      from cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, where can you hide me? for the Chouans are close by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; replied Barbette, as much amazed at the beauty as by the strange
      apparel of a being she could hardly believe to be of her own sex,&mdash;&ldquo;there,
      in the priest&rsquo;s hiding-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her to the head of the bed, and was putting her behind it, when
      they were both startled by the noise of a man springing into the
      courtyard. Barbette had scarcely time to drop the curtain of the bed and
      fold it about the girl before she was face to face with a fugitive Chouan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can I hide, old woman? I am the Comte de Bauvan,&rdquo; said the
      new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil quivered as she recognized the voice of the
      belated guest, whose words, still a secret to her, brought about the
      catastrophe of La Vivetiere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! monseigneur, don&rsquo;t you see, I have no place? What I&rsquo;d better do is
      to keep outside and watch that no one gets in. If the Blues come, I&rsquo;ll let
      you know. If I stay here, and they find me with you, they&rsquo;ll burn my house
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbette left the hut, feeling herself incapable of settling the interests
      of two enemies who, in virtue of the double role her husband was playing,
      had an equal right to her hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only two shots left,&rdquo; said the count, in despair. &ldquo;It will be very
      unlucky if those fellows turn back now and take a fancy to look under this
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed his gun gently against the headboard behind which Marie was
      standing among the folds of the green serge, and stooped to see if there
      was room for him under the bed. He would infallibly have seen her feet,
      but she, rendered desperate by her danger, seized his gun, jumped quickly
      into the room, and threatened him. The count broke into a peal of laughter
      when he caught sight of her, for, in order to hide herself, Marie had
      taken off her broad-brimmed Chouan hat, and her hair was escaping, in
      heavy curls, from the lace scarf which she had worn on leaving home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, monsieur le comte; you are my prisoner. If you make the
      least movement, you shall know what an offended woman is capable of
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the count and Marie stood looking at each other with differing
      emotions, confused voices were heard without among the rocks, calling out,
      &ldquo;Save the Gars! spread out, spread out, save the Gars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbette&rsquo;s voice, calling to her boy, was heard above the tumult with very
      different sensations by the two enemies, to whom Barbette was really
      speaking instead of to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the Blues?&rdquo; she cried sharply. &ldquo;Come here, you little
      scamp, or I shall be after you. Do you want to be shot? Come, hide,
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these things took place rapidly a Blue jumped into the marshy
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beau-Pied!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau-Pied, hearing her voice, rushed into the cottage, and aimed at the
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aristocrat!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stir, or I&rsquo;ll demolish you in a wink, like
      the Bastille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Beau-Pied,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, in a persuasive
      voice, &ldquo;you will be answerable to me for this prisoner. Do as you like
      with him now, but you must return him to me safe and sound at Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the road to Fougeres clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s safe enough&mdash;unless the Chouans come to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil picked up the count&rsquo;s gun gaily, and smiled
      satirically as she said to her prisoner, &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur le comte, au
      revoir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she darted down the path, having replaced the broad hat upon her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned too late,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;not to joke about the virtue
      of a woman who has none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aristocrat!&rdquo; cried Beau-Pied, sternly, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want me to send you
      to your <i>ci-devant</i> paradise, you will not say a word against that
      beautiful lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil returned to Fougeres by the paths which connect
      the rocks of Saint-Sulpice with the Nid-aux-Crocs. When she reached the
      latter height and had threaded the winding way cut in its rough granite,
      she stopped to admire the pretty valley of the Nancon, lately so turbulent
      and now so tranquil. Seen from that point, the vale was like a street of
      verdure. Mademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the town by the Porte
      Saint-Leonard. The inhabitants, still uneasy about the fighting, which,
      judging by the distant firing, was still going on, were waiting the return
      of the National Guard, to judge of their losses. Seeing the girl in her
      strange costume, her hair dishevelled, a gun in her hand, her shawl and
      gown whitened against the walls, soiled with mud and wet with dew, the
      curiosity of the people was keenly excited,&mdash;all the more because the
      power, beauty, and singularity of this young Parisian had been the subject
      of much discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine, full of dreadful fears, had waited for her mistress throughout
      the night, and when she saw her she began to speak; but Marie, with a
      kindly gesture, silenced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not dead, my child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she added, after a pause, &ldquo;I
      wanted emotions when I left Paris, and I have had them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine asked if she should get her some food, observing that she must be
      in great need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; a bath, a bath!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;I must dress at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine was not a little surprised when her mistress required her to
      unpack the most elegant of the dresses she had brought with her. Having
      bathed and breakfasted, Marie made her toilet with all the minute care
      which a woman gives to that important act when she expects to meet the
      eyes of her lover in a ball-room. Francine could not explain to herself
      the mocking gaiety of her mistress. It was not the joy of love,&mdash;a
      woman never mistakes that; it was rather an expression of concentrated
      maliciousness, which to Francine&rsquo;s mind boded evil. Marie herself drew the
      curtains of the window from which the glorious panorama could be seen,
      then she moved the sofa to the chimney corner, turning it so that the
      light would fall becomingly on her face; then she told Francine to fetch
      flowers, that the room might have a festive air; and when they came she
      herself directed their arrangement in a picturesque manner. Giving a last
      glance of satisfaction at these various preparations she sent Francine to
      the commandant with a request that he would bring her prisoner to her;
      then she lay down luxuriously on a sofa, partly to rest, and partly to
      throw herself into an attitude of graceful weakness, the power of which is
      irresistible in certain women. A soft languor, the seductive pose of her
      feet just seen below the drapery of her gown, the plastic ease of her
      body, the curving of the throat,&mdash;all, even the droop of her slender
      fingers as they hung from the pillow like the buds of a bunch of jasmine,
      combined with her eyes to produce seduction. She burned certain perfumes
      to fill the air with those subtle emanations which affect men&rsquo;s fibres
      powerfully, and often prepare the way for conquests which women seek to
      make without seeming to desire them. Presently the heavy step of the old
      soldier resounded in the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, commandant, where is my captive?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just ordered a picket of twelve men to shoot him, being taken with
      arms in his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you disposed of my prisoner?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Listen to me,
      commandant; surely, if I can trust your face, the death of a man <i>after</i>
      a fight is no particular satisfaction to you. Well, then, give my Chouan a
      reprieve, for which I will be responsible, and let me see him. I assure
      you that aristocrat has become essential to me, and he can be made to
      further the success of our plans. Besides, to shoot a mere amateur in
      Chouannerie would be as absurd as to fire on a balloon when a pinprick
      would disinflate it. For heaven&rsquo;s sake leave cruelty to the aristocracy.
      Republicans ought to be generous. Wouldn&rsquo;t you and yours have forgiven the
      victims of Quiberon? Come, send your twelve men to patrol the town, and
      dine with me and bring the prisoner. There is only an hour of daylight
      left, and don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she added smiling, &ldquo;that if you are too late, my
      toilet will have lost its effect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the commandant, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what? But I know what you mean. Don&rsquo;t be anxious; the count shall
      not escape. Sooner or later that big butterfly will burn himself in your
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant shrugged his shoulders slightly, with the air of a man who
      is forced to obey, whether he will or no, the commands of a pretty woman;
      and he returned in about half an hour, followed by the Comte de Bauvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil feigned surprise and seemed confused that the
      count should see her in such a negligent attitude; then, after reading in
      his eyes that her first effect was produced, she rose and busied herself
      about her guests with well-bred courtesy. There was nothing studied or
      forced in her motions, smiles, behavior, or voice, nothing that betrayed
      premeditation or purpose. All was harmonious; no part was over-acted; an
      observer could not have supposed that she affected the manners of a
      society in which she had not lived. When the Royalist and the Republic
      were seated she looked sternly at the count. He, on his part, knew women
      sufficiently well to feel certain that the offence he had committed
      against this woman was equivalent to a sentence of death. But in spite of
      this conviction, and without seeming either gay or gloomy, he had the air
      of a man who did not take such serious results into consideration; in
      fact, he really thought it ridiculous to fear death in presence of a
      pretty woman. Marie&rsquo;s stern manner roused ideas in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;whether a count&rsquo;s coronet wouldn&rsquo;t please her as
      well as that of her lost marquis? Montauran is as lean as a nail, while I&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he looked himself over with an air of satisfaction. &ldquo;At any rate I
      should save my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These diplomatic revelations were wasted. The passion the count proposed
      to feign for Mademoiselle de Verneuil became a violent caprice, which the
      dangerous creature did her best to heighten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are my prisoner, and I have the right
      to dispose of you. Your execution cannot take place without my consent,
      and I have too much curiosity to let them shoot you at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose I am obstinate enough to keep silence?&rdquo; he replied gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an honest woman, perhaps, but with a woman of the town, no, no,
      monsieur le comte, impossible!&rdquo; These words, full of bitter sarcasm, were
      hissed, as Sully says, in speaking of the Duchesse de Beaufort, from so
      sharp a beak that the count, amazed, merely looked at his antagonist.
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, with a scornful glance, &ldquo;not to contradict you, if I
      am a creature of that kind I will act like one. Here is your gun,&rdquo; and she
      offered him his weapon with a mocking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the honor of a gentleman, mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, interrupting him, &ldquo;I have had enough of the honor of
      gentlemen. It was on the faith of that that I went to La Vivetiere. Your
      leader had sworn to me that I and my escort should be safe there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an infamy!&rdquo; cried Hulot, contracting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fault lies with monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said Marie, addressing Hulot. &ldquo;I
      have no doubt the Gars meant to keep his word, but this gentleman told
      some calumny about me which confirmed those that Charette&rsquo;s mistress had
      already invented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the count, much troubled, &ldquo;with my head under the axe
      I would swear that I said nothing but the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In saying what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you were the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the word, mistress of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis de Lenoncourt, the present duke, a friend of mine,&rdquo; replied
      the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I can let you go to execution,&rdquo; she said, without seeming at all
      agitated by the outspoken reply of the count, who was amazed at the real
      or pretended indifference with which she heard his statement. &ldquo;However,&rdquo;
       she added, laughing, &ldquo;you have not wronged me more than that friend of
      whom you suppose me to have been the&mdash;Fie! monsieur le comte; surely
      you used to visit my father, the Duc de Verneuil? Yes? well then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently considering Hulot one too many for the confidence she was about
      to make, Mademoiselle de Verneuil motioned the count to her side, and said
      a few words in her ear. Monsieur de Bauvan gave a low ejaculation of
      surprise and looked with bewilderment at Marie, who completed the effect
      of her words by leaning against the chimney in the artless and innocent
      attitude of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried the count, &ldquo;I entreat your forgiveness, unworthy as
      I am of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You have no more ground for
      repentance than you had for the insolent supposition you proclaimed at La
      Vivetiere. But this is a matter beyond your comprehension. Only, remember
      this, monsieur le comte, the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil has too
      generous a spirit not to take a lively interest in your fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even after I have insulted you?&rdquo; said the count, with a sort of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some are placed so high that insult cannot touch them. Monsieur le comte,&mdash;I
      am one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said the words, the girl assumed an air of pride and nobility which
      impressed the prisoner and made the whole of this strange intrigue much
      less clear to Hulot than the old soldier had thought it. He twirled his
      moustache and looked uneasily at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who made him a
      sign, as if to say she was still carrying out her plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Marie, after a pause, &ldquo;let us discuss these matters.
      Francine, my dear, bring lights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She adroitly led the conversation to the times which had now, within a few
      short years, become the &ldquo;ancien regime.&rdquo; She brought back that period to
      the count&rsquo;s mind by the liveliness of her remarks and sketches, and gave
      him so many opportunities to display his wit, by cleverly throwing
      repartees in his way, that he ended by thinking he had never been so
      charming; and that idea having rejuvenated him, he endeavored to inspire
      this seductive young woman with his own good opinion of himself. The
      malicious creature practised, in return, every art of her coquetry upon
      him, all the more adroitly because it was mere play to her. Sometimes she
      let him think he was making rapid progress, and then, as if surprised at
      the sentiment she was feeling, she showed a sudden coolness which charmed
      him, and served to increase imperceptibly his impromptu passion. She was
      like a fisherman who lifts his line from time to time to see if the fish
      is biting. The poor count allowed himself to be deceived by the innocent
      air with which she accepted two or three neatly turned compliments.
      Emigration, Brittany, the Republic, and the Chouans were far indeed from
      his thoughts. Hulot sat erect and silent as the god Thermes. His want of
      education made him quite incapable of taking part in a conversation of
      this kind; he supposed that the talking pair were very witty, but his
      efforts at comprehension were limited to discovering whether they were
      plotting against the Republic in covert language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montauran,&rdquo; the count was saying, &ldquo;has birth and breeding, he is a
      charming fellow, but he doesn&rsquo;t understand gallantry. He is too young to
      have seen Versailles. His education is deficient. Instead of
      diplomatically defaming, he strikes a blow. He may be able to love
      violently, but he will never have that fine flower of breeding in his
      gallantry which distinguished Lauzun, Adhemar, Coigny, and so many others!
      He hasn&rsquo;t the winning art of saying those pretty nothings to women which,
      after all, they like better than bursts of passion, which soon weary them.
      Yes, though he has undoubtedly had many love-affairs, he has neither the
      grace nor the ease that should belong to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed that myself,&rdquo; said Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought the count, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an inflection in her voice, and a look
      in her eye which shows me plainly I shall soon be <i>on terms</i> with
      her; and faith! to get her, I&rsquo;ll believe all she wants me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered her his hand, for dinner was now announced. Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil did the honors with a politeness and tact which could only have
      been acquired by the life and training of a court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us,&rdquo; she whispered to Hulot as they left the table. &ldquo;You will only
      frighten him; whereas, if I am alone with him I shall soon find out all I
      want to know; he has reached the point where a man tells me everything he
      thinks, and sees through my eyes only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But afterwards?&rdquo; said Hulot, evidently intending to claim the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards, he is to be free&mdash;free as air,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was taken with arms in his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, making one of those sophistical jokes with which women
      parry unanswerable arguments, &ldquo;I had disarmed him. Count,&rdquo; she said,
      turning back to him as Hulot departed, &ldquo;I have just obtained your liberty,
      but&mdash;nothing for nothing,&rdquo; she added, laughing, with her head on one
      side as if to interrogate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask all, even my name and my honor,&rdquo; he cried, intoxicated. &ldquo;I lay them
      at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced to seize her hand, trying to make her take his passion for
      gratitude; but Mademoiselle de Verneuil was not a woman to be thus misled.
      So, smiling in a way to give some hope to this new lover, she drew back a
      few steps and said: &ldquo;You might make me regret my confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imagination of a young girl is more rapid than that of a woman,&rdquo; he
      answered, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young girl has more to lose than a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; those who carry a treasure ought to be distrustful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us quit such conventional language,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and talk seriously.
      You are to give a ball at Saint-James. I hear that your headquarters,
      arsenals, and base of supplies are there. When is the ball to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be surprised if a slandered woman desires, with a woman&rsquo;s
      obstinacy, to obtain a public reparation for the insults offered to her,
      in presence of those who witnessed them. I shall go to your ball. I ask
      you to give me your protection from the moment I enter the room until I
      leave it. I ask nothing more than a promise,&rdquo; she added, as he laid his
      hand on his heart. &ldquo;I abhor oaths; they are too like precautions. Tell me
      only that you engage to protect my person from all dangers, criminal or
      shameful. Promise to repair the wrong you did me, by openly acknowledging
      that I am the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil; but say nothing of the
      trials I have borne in being illegitimate,&mdash;this will pay your debt
      to me. Ha! two hours&rsquo; attendance on a woman in a ball-room is not so dear
      a ransom for your life, is it? You are not worth a ducat more.&rdquo; Her smile
      took the insult from her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you ask for the gun?&rdquo; said the count, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! more than I do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secrecy. Believe me, my dear count, a woman is never fathomed except by a
      woman. I am certain that if you say one word of this, I shall be murdered
      on my way to that ball. Yesterday I had warning enough. Yes, that woman is
      quick to act. Ah! I implore you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;contrive that no harm shall
      come to me at the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be there under my protection,&rdquo; said the count, proudly. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
       he added, with a doubtful air, &ldquo;are you coming for the sake of Montauran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to know more than I know myself,&rdquo; she answered, laughing. &ldquo;Now
      go,&rdquo; she added, after a pause. &ldquo;I will take you to the gate of the town
      myself, for this seems to me a cannibal warfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do feel some interest in me?&rdquo; exclaimed the count. &ldquo;Ah!
      mademoiselle, permit me to hope that you will not be insensible to my
      friendship&mdash;for that sentiment must content me, must it not?&rdquo; he
      added with a conceited air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! diviner!&rdquo; she said, putting on the gay expression a woman assumes
      when she makes an avowal which compromises neither her dignity nor her
      secret sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having slipped on a pelisse, she accompanied him as far as the
      Nid-aux-Crocs. When they reached the end of the path she said, &ldquo;Monsieur,
      be absolutely silent on all this; even to the marquis&rdquo;; and she laid her
      finger on both lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count, emboldened by so much kindness, took her hand; she let him do
      so as though it were a great favor, and he kissed it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mademoiselle,&rdquo; he cried, on knowing himself beyond all danger, &ldquo;rely
      on me for life, for death. Though I owe you a gratitude equal to that I
      owe my mother, it will be very difficult to restrain my feelings to mere
      respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang into the narrow pathway. After watching him till he reached the
      rocks of Saint-Sulpice, Marie nodded her head in sign of satisfaction,
      saying to herself in a low voice: &ldquo;That fat fellow has given me more than
      his life for his life! I can make him my creator at a very little cost!
      Creature or creator, that&rsquo;s all the difference there is between one man
      and another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish her thought, but with a look of despair she turned and
      re-entered the Porte Saint-Leonard, where Hulot and Corentin were awaiting
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two more days,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and then&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, observing that
      they were not alone&mdash;&ldquo;he shall fall under your guns,&rdquo; she whispered
      to Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commandant recoiled a step and looked with a jeering contempt,
      impossible to render, at the woman whose features and expression gave no
      sign whatever of relenting. There is one thing remarkable about women:
      they never reason about their blameworthy actions,&mdash;feeling carries
      them off their feet; even in their dissimulation there is an element of
      sincerity; and in women alone crime may exist without baseness, for it
      often happens that they do not know how it came about that they committed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Saint-James, to a ball the Chouans give to-morrow night,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Corentin, interrupting her, &ldquo;that is fifteen miles distant;
      had I not better accompany you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think a great deal too much of something I never think of at all,&rdquo;
       she replied, &ldquo;and that is yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie&rsquo;s contempt for Corentin was extremely pleasing to Hulot, who made
      his well-known grimace as she turned away in the direction of her own
      house. Corentin followed her with his eyes, letting his face express a
      consciousness of the fatal power he knew he could exercise over the
      charming creature, by working upon the passions which sooner or later, he
      believed, would give her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mademoiselle de Verneuil reached home she began to deliberate
      on her ball-dress. Francine, accustomed to obey without understanding her
      mistress&rsquo;s motives, opened the trunks, and suggested a Greek costume. The
      Republican fashions of those days were all Greek in style. Marie chose one
      which could be put in a box that was easy to carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine, my dear, I am going on an excursion into the country; do you
      want to go with me, or will you stay behind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay behind!&rdquo; exclaimed Francine; &ldquo;then who would dress you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you put that glove I gave you this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sew this green ribbon into it, and, above all, take plenty of money.&rdquo;
       Then noticing that Francine was taking out a number of the new Republican
      coins, she cried out, &ldquo;Not those; they would get us murdered. Send Jeremie
      to Corentin&mdash;no, stay, the wretch would follow me&mdash;send to the
      commandant; ask him from me for some six-franc crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the feminine sagacity which takes in the smallest detail, she thought
      of everything. While Francine was completing the arrangements for this
      extraordinary trip, Marie practised the art of imitating an owl, and so
      far succeeded in rivalling Marche-a-Terre that the illusion was a good
      one. At midnight she left Fougeres by the gate of Saint-Leonard, took the
      little path to Nid-aux-Crocs, and started, followed by Francine, to cross
      the Val de Gibarry with a firm step, under the impulse of that strong will
      which gives to the body and its bearing such an expression of force. To
      leave a ball-room with sufficient care to avoid a cold is an important
      affair to the health of a woman; but let her have a passion in her heart,
      and her body becomes adamant. Such an enterprise as Marie had now
      undertaken would have floated in a bold man&rsquo;s mind for a long time; but
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil had no sooner thought of it than its dangers
      became to her attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are starting without asking God to bless you,&rdquo; said Francine, turning
      to look at the tower of Saint-Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pious Breton stopped, clasped her hands, and said an &ldquo;Ave&rdquo; to Saint
      Anne of Auray, imploring her to bless their expedition; during which time
      her mistress waited pensively, looking first at the artless attitude of
      her maid who was praying fervently, and then at the effects of the
      vaporous moonlight as it glided among the traceries of the church
      building, giving to the granite all the delicacy of filagree. The pair
      soon reached the hut of Galope-Chopine. Light as their steps were they
      roused one of those huge watch-dogs on whose fidelity the Bretons rely,
      putting no fastening to their doors but a simple latch. The dog ran to the
      strangers, and his bark became so threatening that they were forced to
      retreat a few steps and call for help. But no one came. Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil then gave the owl&rsquo;s cry, and instantly the rusty hinges of the
      door made a creaking sound, and Galope-Chopine, who had risen hastily, put
      out his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to go to Saint-James,&rdquo; said Marie, showing the Gars&rsquo; glove.
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte de Bauvan told me that you would take me there and
      protect me on the way. Therefore be good enough to get us two riding
      donkeys, and make yourself ready to go with us. Time is precious, for if
      we do not get to Saint-James before to-morrow night I can neither see the
      ball nor the Gars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galope-Chopine, completely bewildered, took the glove and turned it over
      and over, after lighting a pitch candle about a finger thick and the color
      of gingerbread. This article of consumption, imported into Brittany from
      the North, was only one more proof to the eyes in this strange country of
      a utter ignorance of all commercial principles, even the commonest. After
      seeing the green ribbon, staring at Mademoiselle de Verneuil, scratching
      his ear, and drinking a beaker of cider (having first offered a glass to
      the beautiful lady), Galope-Chopine left her seated before the table and
      went to fetch the required donkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violet gleam cast by the pitch candle was not powerful enough to
      counteract the fitful moonlight, which touched the dark floor and
      furniture of the smoke-blackened cottage with luminous points. The little
      boy had lifted his pretty head inquisitively, and above it two cows were
      poking their rosy muzzles and brilliant eyes through the holes in the
      stable wall. The big dog, whose countenance was by no means the least
      intelligent of the family, seemed to be examining the strangers with as
      much curiosity as the little boy. A painter would have stopped to admire
      the night effects of this scene, but Marie, not wishing to enter into
      conversation with Barbette, who sat up in bed and began to show signs of
      amazement at recognizing her, left the hovel to escape its fetid air and
      the questions of its mistress. She ran quickly up the stone staircase
      behind the cottage, admiring the vast details of the landscape, the aspect
      of which underwent as many changes as spectators made steps either upward
      to the summits or downward to the valleys. The moonlight was now
      enveloping like a luminous mist the valley of Couesnon. Certainly a woman
      whose heart was burdened with a despised love would be sensitive to the
      melancholy which that soft brilliancy inspires in the soul, by the weird
      appearance it gives to objects and the colors with which it tints the
      streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was presently broken by the braying of a donkey. Marie went
      quickly back to the hut, and the party started. Galope-Chopine, armed with
      a double-barrelled gun, wore a long goatskin, which gave him something the
      look of Robinson Crusoe. His blotched face, seamed with wrinkles, was
      scarcely visible under the broad-brimmed hat which the Breton peasants
      still retain as a tradition of the olden time; proud to have won, after
      their servitude, the right to wear the former ornament of seignorial
      heads. This nocturnal caravan, protected by a guide whose clothing,
      attitudes, and person had something patriarchal about them, bore no little
      resemblance to the Flight into Egypt as we see it represented by the
      sombre brush of Rembrandt. Galope-Chopine carefully avoided the main-road
      and guided the two women through the labyrinth of by-ways which intersect
      Brittany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil then understood the Chouan warfare. In threading
      these complicated paths, she could better appreciate the condition of a
      country which when she saw it from an elevation had seemed to her so
      charming, but into which it was necessary to penetrate before the dangers
      and inextricable difficulties of it could be understood. Round each field,
      and from time immemorial, the peasants have piled mud walls, about six
      feet high, and prismatic in shape; on the top of which grow chestnuts,
      oaks and beeches. The walls thus planted are called hedges (Norman hedges)
      and the long branches of the trees sweeping over the pathways arch them.
      Sunken between these walls (made of a clay soil) the paths are like the
      covered ways of a fortification, and where the granite rock, which in
      these regions comes to the surface of the ground, does not make a sort of
      rugged natural pavement, they become so impracticable that the smallest
      vehicles can only be drawn over them by two pairs of oxen or Breton
      horses, which are small but usually vigorous. These by-ways are so swampy
      that foot-passengers have gradually by long usage made other paths beside
      them on the hedge-banks which are called &ldquo;rotes&rdquo;; and these begin and end
      with each division into fields. In order to cross from one field to
      another it is necessary to climb the clay banks by means of steps which
      are often very slippery after a rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travellers have many other obstacles to encounter in these intricate
      paths. Thus surrounded, each field is closed by what is called in the West
      an <i>echalier</i>. That is a trunk or stout branch of a tree, one end of
      which, being pierced, is fitted to an upright post which serves as a pivot
      on which it turns. One end of the <i>echalier</i> projects far enough
      beyond the pivot to hold a weight, and this singular rustic gate, the post
      of which rests in a hole made in the bank, is so easy to work that a child
      can handle it. Sometimes the peasants economize the stone which forms the
      weight by lengthening the trunk or branch beyond the pivot. This method of
      enclosure varies with the genius of each proprietor. Sometimes it consists
      of a single trunk or branch, both ends of which are embedded in the bank.
      In other places it looks like a gate, and is made of several slim branches
      placed at regular distances like the steps of a ladder lying horizontally.
      The form turns, like the <i>echalier</i>, on a pivot. These &ldquo;hedges&rdquo; and
      <i>echaliers</i> give the region the appearance of a huge chess-board,
      each field forming a square, perfectly isolated from the rest, closed like
      a fortress and protected by ramparts. The gate, which is very easy to
      defend, is a dangerous spot for assailants. The Breton peasant thinks he
      improves his fallow land by encouraging the growth of gorse, a shrub so
      well treated in these regions that it soon attains the height of a man.
      This delusion, worthy of a population which puts its manure on the highest
      spot in the courtyard, has covered the soil to a proportion of one fourth
      with masses of gorse, in the midst of which a thousand men might ambush.
      Also there is scarcely a field without a number of old apple-trees, the
      fruit being used for cider, which kill the vegetation wherever their
      branches cover the ground. Now, if the reader will reflect on the small
      extent of open ground within these hedges and large trees whose hungry
      roots impoverish the soil, he will have an idea of the cultivation and
      general character of the region through which Mademoiselle de Verneuil was
      now passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to say whether the object of these enclosures is to avoid
      all disputes of possession, or whether the custom is a lazy one of keeping
      the cattle from straying, without the trouble of watching them; at any
      rate such formidable barriers are permanent obstacles, which make these
      regions impenetrable and ordinary warfare impossible. There lies the whole
      secret of the Chouan war. Mademoiselle de Verneuil saw plainly the
      necessity the Republic was under to strangle the disaffection by means of
      police and by negotiation, rather than by a useless employment of military
      force. What could be done, in fact, with a people wise enough to despise
      the possession of towns, and hold to that of an open country already
      furnished with indestructible fortifications? Surely, nothing except
      negotiate; especially as the whole active strength of these deluded
      peasants lay in a single able and enterprising leader. She admired the
      genius of the minister who, sitting in his study, had been able to grasp
      the true way of procuring peace. She thought she understood the
      considerations which act on the minds of men powerful enough to take a
      bird&rsquo;s-eye view of an empire; men whose actions, criminal in the eyes of
      the masses, are the outcome of a vast and intelligent thought. There is in
      these terrible souls some mysterious blending of the force of fate and
      that of destiny, some prescience which suddenly elevates them above their
      fellows; the masses seek them for a time in their own ranks, then they
      raise their eyes and see these lordly souls above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such reflections as these seemed to Mademoiselle de Verneuil to justify
      and even to ennoble her thoughts of vengeance; this travail of her soul
      and its expectations gave her vigor enough to bear the unusual fatigues of
      this strange journey. At the end of each property Galope-Chopine made the
      women dismount from their donkeys and climb the obstructions; then,
      mounting again, they made their way through the boggy paths which already
      felt the approach of winter. The combination of tall trees, sunken paths,
      and enclosed places, kept the soil in a state of humidity which wrapped
      the travellers in a mantle of ice. However, after much wearisome fatigue,
      they managed to reach the woods of Marignay by sunrise. The journey then
      became less difficult, and led by a broad footway through the forest. The
      arch formed by the branches, and the great size of the trees protected the
      travellers from the weather, and the many difficulties of the first half
      of their way did not recur.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had hardly gone a couple of miles through the woods before they heard
      a confused noise of distant voices and the tinkling of a bell, the silvery
      tones of which did not have the monotonous sound given by the movements of
      cattle. Galope-Chopine listened with great attention, as he walked along,
      to this melody; presently a puff of wind brought several chanted words to
      his ear, which seemed to affect him powerfully, for he suddenly turned the
      wearied donkeys into a by-path, which led away from Saint-James, paying no
      attention to the remonstrances of Mademoiselle de Verneuil, whose fears
      were increased by the darkness of the forest path along which their guide
      now led them. To right and left were enormous blocks of granite, laid one
      upon the other, of whimsical shape. Across them huge roots had glided,
      like monstrous serpents, seeking from afar the juicy nourishment enjoyed
      by a few beeches. The two sides of the road resembled the subterranean
      grottos that are famous for stalactites. Immense festoons of stone, where
      the darkling verdure of ivy and holly allied itself to the green-gray
      patches of the moss and lichen, hid the precipices and the openings into
      several caves. When the three travellers had gone a few steps through a
      very narrow path a most surprising spectacle suddenly unfolded itself to
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s eyes, and made her understand the obstinacy of
      her Chouan guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A semi-circular basin of granite blocks formed an ampitheatre, on the
      rough tiers of which rose tall black pines and yellowing chestnuts, one
      above the other, like a vast circus, where the wintry sun shed its pale
      colors rather than poured its light, and autumn had spread her tawny
      carpet of fallen leaves. About the middle of this hall, which seemed to
      have had the deluge for its architect, stood three enormous Druid stones,&mdash;a
      vast altar, on which was raised an old church-banner. About a hundred men,
      kneeling with bared heads, were praying fervently in this natural
      enclosure, where a priest, assisted by two other ecclesiastics, was saying
      mass. The poverty of the sacerdotal vestments, the feeble voice of the
      priest, which echoed like a murmur through the open space, the praying men
      filled with conviction and united by one and the same sentiment, the bare
      cross, the wild and barren temple, the dawning day, gave the primitive
      character of the earlier times of Christianity to the scene. Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil was struck with admiration. This mass said in the depths of
      the woods, this worship driven back by persecution to its sources, the
      poesy of ancient times revived in the midst of this weird and romantic
      nature, these armed and unarmed Chouans, cruel and praying, men yet
      children, all these things resembled nothing that she had ever seen or yet
      imagined. She remembered admiring in her childhood the pomps of the Roman
      church so pleasing to the senses; but she knew nothing of God <i>alone</i>,
      his cross on the altar, his altar the earth. In place of the carved
      foliage of a Gothic cathedral, the autumnal trees upheld the sky; instead
      of a thousand colors thrown through stained glass windows, the sun could
      barely slide its ruddy rays and dull reflections on altar, priest, and
      people. The men present were a fact, a reality, and not a system,&mdash;it
      was a prayer, not a religion. But human passions, the momentary repression
      of which gave harmony to the picture, soon reappeared on this mysterious
      scene and gave it powerful vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mademoiselle de Verneuil reached the spot the reading of the gospel was
      just over. She recognized in the officiating priest, not without fear, the
      Abbe Gudin, and she hastily slipped behind a granite block, drawing
      Francine after her. She was, however, unable to move Galope-Chopine from
      the place he had chosen, and from which he intended to share in the
      benefits of the ceremony; but she noticed the nature of the ground around
      her, and hoped to be able to evade the danger by getting away, when the
      service was over, before the priests. Through a large fissure of the rock
      that hid her, she saw the Abbe Gudin mounting a block of granite which
      served him as a pulpit, where he began his sermon with the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All present made the sign of the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; continued the abbe, &ldquo;let us pray in the first place for
      the souls of the dead,&mdash;Jean Cochegrue, Nicalos Laferte, Joseph
      Brouet, Francois Parquoi, Sulpice Coupiau, all of this parish, and dead of
      wounds received in the fight on Mont Pelerine and at the siege of
      Fougeres. <i>De profundis</i>,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalm was recited, according to custom, by the congregation and the
      priests, taking verses alternately with a fervor which augured well for
      the success of the sermon. When it was over the abbe continued, in a voice
      which became gradually louder and louder, for the former Jesuit was not
      unaware that vehemence of delivery was in itself a powerful argument with
      which to persuade his semi-savage hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These defenders of our God, Christians, have set you an example of duty,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Are you not ashamed of what will be said of you in paradise? If
      it were not for these blessed ones, who have just been received with open
      arms by all the saints, our Lord might have thought that your parish is
      inhabited by Mahometans!&mdash;Do you know, men, what is said of you in
      Brittany and in the king&rsquo;s presence? What! you don&rsquo;t know? Then I shall
      tell you. They say: &lsquo;Behold, the Blues have cast down altars, and killed
      priests, and murdered the king and queen; they mean to make the parish
      folk of Brittany Blues like themselves, and send them to fight in foreign
      lands, away from their churches, where they run the risk of dying without
      confession and going eternally to hell; and yet the gars of Marignay,
      whose churches they have burned, stand still with folded arms! Oh! oh!
      this Republic of damned souls has sold the property of God and that of the
      nobles at auction; it has shared the proceeds with the Blues; it has
      decreed, in order to gorge itself with money as it does with blood, that a
      crown shall be only worth three francs instead of six; and yet the gars of
      Marignay haven&rsquo;t seized their weapons and driven the Blues from Brittany!
      Ha! paradise will be closed to them! they can never save their souls!&rsquo; 
      That&rsquo;s what they say of you in the king&rsquo;s presence! It is your own
      salvation, Christians, which is at stake. Your souls are to be saved by
      fighting for religion and the king. Saint Anne of Auray herself appeared
      to me yesterday at half-past two o&rsquo;clock; and she said to me these very
      words which I now repeat to you: &lsquo;Are you a priest of Marignay?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,
      madame, ready to serve you.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am Saint Anne of Auray, aunt of God, after
      the manner of Brittany. I have come to bid you warn the people of Marignay
      that they must not hope for salvation if they do not take arms. You are to
      refuse them absolution for their sins unless they serve God. Bless their
      guns, and those who gain absolution will never miss the Blues, because
      their guns are sanctified.&rsquo; She disappeared, leaving an odor of incense
      behind her. I marked the spot. It is under the oak of the Patte d&rsquo;Oie;
      just where that beautiful wooden Virgin was placed by the rector of
      Saint-James; to whom the crippled mother of Pierre Leroi (otherwise called
      Marche-a-Terre) came to pray, and was cured of all her pains, because of
      her son&rsquo;s good deeds. You see her there in the midst of you, and you know
      that she walks without assistance. It was a miracle&mdash;a miracle
      intended, like the resurrection of Marie Lambrequin to prove to you that
      God will never forsake the Breton cause so long as the people fight for
      his servants and for the king. Therefore, my dear brothers, if you wish to
      save your souls and show yourselves defenders of God and the king, you
      will obey all the orders of the man whom God has sent to us, and whom we
      call THE GARS. Then indeed, you will no longer be Mahometans; you will
      rank with all the gars of Brittany under the flag of God. You can take
      from the pockets of the Blues the money they have stolen from you; for, if
      the fields have to go uncultivated while you are making war, God and the
      king will deliver to you the spoils of your enemies. Shall it be said,
      Christians, that the gars of Marignay are behind the gars of the Morbihan,
      the gars of Saint-Georges, of Vitre, or Antrain, who are all faithful to
      God and the king? Will you let them get all the spoils? Will you stand
      like heretics, with your arms folded, when other Bretons are saving their
      souls and saving their king? &lsquo;Forsake all, and follow me,&rsquo; says the
      Gospel. Have we not forsaken our tithes, we priests? And you, I say to
      you, forsake all for this holy war! You shall be like the Maccabees. All
      will be forgiven you. You will find the priests and curates in your midst,
      and you will conquer! Pay attention to these words, Christians,&rdquo; he said,
      as he ended; &ldquo;for this day only have we the power to bless your guns.
      Those who do not take advantage of the Saint&rsquo;s favor will not find her
      merciful; she will not forgive them or listen to them as she did in the
      last war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appeal, enforced by the power of a loud voice and by many gestures,
      the vehemence of which bathed the orator in perspiration, produced,
      apparently, very little effect. The peasants stood motionless, their eyes
      on the speaker, like statues; but Mademoiselle de Verneuil presently
      noticed that this universal attitude was the result of a spell cast by the
      abbe on the crowd. He had, like great actors, held his audience as one man
      by addressing their passions and self-interests. He had absolved excesses
      before committal, and broken the only bonds which held these boorish men
      to the practice of religious and social precepts. He had prostituted his
      sacred office to political interests; but it must be said that, in these
      times of revolution, every man made a weapon of whatever he possessed for
      the benefit of his party, and the pacific cross of Jesus became as much an
      instrument of war as the peasant&rsquo;s plough-share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing no one with whom to advise, Mademoiselle de Verneuil turned to look
      for Francine, and was not a little astonished to see that she shared in
      the rapt enthusiasm, and was devoutly saying her chaplet over some beads
      which Galope-Chopine had probably given her during the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;are you afraid of being a
      Mahometan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;just see Pierre&rsquo;s mother; she is
      walking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francine&rsquo;s whole attitude showed such deep conviction that Marie
      understood at once the secret of the homily, the influence of the clergy
      over the rural masses, and the tremendous effect of the scene which was
      now beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasants advanced one by one and knelt down, presenting their guns to
      the preacher, who laid them upon the altar. Galope-Chopine offered his old
      duck-shooter. The three priests sang the hymn &ldquo;Veni, Creator,&rdquo; while the
      celebrant wrapped the instruments of death in bluish clouds of incense,
      waving the smoke into shapes that appeared to interlace one another. When
      the breeze had dispersed the vapor the guns were returned in due order.
      Each man received his own on his knees from the hands of the priests, who
      recited a Latin prayer as they returned them. After the men had regained
      their places, the profound enthusiasm of the congregation, mute till then,
      broke forth and resounded in a formidable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Domine salvum fac regem</i>!&rdquo; was the prayer which the preacher
      intoned in an echoing voice, and was then sung vehemently by the people.
      The cry had something savage and warlike in it. The two notes of the word
      <i>regem</i>, readily interpreted by the peasants, were taken with such
      energy that Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s thoughts reverted almost tenderly
      to the exiled Bourbon family. These recollections awakened those of her
      past life. Her memory revived the fetes of a court now dispersed, in which
      she had once a share. The face of the marquis entered her reverie. With
      the natural mobility of a woman&rsquo;s mind she forgot the scene before her and
      reverted to her plans of vengeance, which might cost her her life or come
      to nought under the influence of a look. Seeing a branch of holly the
      trivial thought crossed her mind that in this decisive moment, when she
      wished to appear in all her beauty at the ball, she had no decoration for
      her hair; and she gathered a tuft of the prickly leaves and shining
      berries with the idea of wearing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! my gun may miss fire on a duck, but on a Blue, never!&rdquo; cried
      Galope-Chopine, nodding his head in sign of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie examined her guide&rsquo;s face attentively, and found it of the type of
      those she had just seen. The old Chouan had evidently no more ideas than a
      child. A naive joy wrinkled his cheeks and forehead as he looked at his
      gun; but a pious conviction cast upon that expression of his joy a tinge
      of fanaticism, which brought into his face for an instant the signs of the
      vices of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they reached a village, or rather a collection of huts like that
      of Galope-Chopine, where the rest of the congregation arrived before
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil had finished the milk and bread and butter which
      formed the meal. This irregular company was led by the abbe, who held in
      his hand a rough cross draped with a flag, followed by a gars, who was
      proudly carrying the parish banner. Mademoiselle de Verneuil was compelled
      to mingle with this detachment, which was on its way, like herself, to
      Saint-James, and would naturally protect her from all danger as soon as
      Galope-Chopine informed them that the Gars glove was in her possession,
      provided always that the abbe did not see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards sunset the three travellers arrived safely at Saint-James, a
      little town which owes its name to the English, by whom it was built in
      the fourteenth century, during their occupation of Brittany. Before
      entering it Mademoiselle de Verneuil was witness of a strange scene of
      this strange war, to which, however, she gave little attention; she feared
      to be recognized by some of her enemies, and this dread hastened her
      steps. Five or six thousand peasants were camping in a field. Their
      clothing was not in any degree warlike; in fact, this tumultuous assembly
      resembled that of a great fair. Some attention was needed to even observe
      that these Bretons were armed, for their goatskins were so made as to hide
      their guns, and the weapons that were chiefly visible were the scythes
      with which some of the men had armed themselves while awaiting the
      distribution of muskets. Some were eating and drinking, others were
      fighting and quarrelling in loud tones, but the greater part were sleeping
      on the ground. An officer in a red uniform attracted Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil&rsquo;s attention, and she supposed him to belong to the English
      service. At a little distance two other officers seemed to be trying to
      teach a few Chouans, more intelligent than the rest, to handle two cannon,
      which apparently formed the whole artillery of the royalist army. Shouts
      hailed the coming of the gars of Marignay, who were recognized by their
      banner. Under cover of the tumult which the new-comers and the priests
      excited in the camp, Mademoiselle de Verneuil was able to make her way
      past it and into the town without danger. She stopped at a plain-looking
      inn not far from the building where the ball was to be given. The town was
      so full of strangers that she could only obtain one miserable room. When
      she was safely in it Galope-Chopine brought Francine the box which
      contained the ball dress, and having done so he stood stock-still in an
      attitude of indescribable irresolution. At any other time Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil would have been much amused to see what a Breton peasant can be
      like when he leaves his native parish; but now she broke the charm by
      opening her purse and producing four crowns of six francs each, which she
      gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if you wish to oblige me, you will go straight
      back to Fougeres without entering the camp or drinking any cider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouan, amazed at her liberality, looked first at the crowns (which he
      had taken) and then at Mademoiselle de Verneuil; but she made him a sign
      with her hand and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you send him away, mademoiselle?&rdquo; said Francine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
      how the place is surrounded? we shall never get away! and who will protect
      you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a protector of your own,&rdquo; said Marie maliciously, giving in an
      undertone Marche-a-Terre&rsquo;s owl cry which she was constantly practising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine colored, and smiled rather sadly at her mistress&rsquo;s gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is yours?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil plucked out her dagger, and showed it to the
      frightened girl, who dropped on a chair and clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you come here for, Marie?&rdquo; she cried in a supplicating voice
      which asked no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was busily twisting the branches of holly which
      she had gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether this holly will be becoming,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;a brilliant
      skin like mine may possibly bear a dark wreath of this kind. What do you
      think, Francine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several remarks of the same kind as she dressed for the ball showed the
      absolute self-possession and coolness of this strange woman. Whoever had
      listened to her then would have found it hard to believe in the gravity of
      a situation in which she was risking her life. An Indian muslin gown,
      rather short and clinging like damp linen, revealed the delicate outlines
      of her shape; over this she wore a red drapery, numerous folds of which,
      gradually lengthening as they fell by her side, took the graceful curves
      of a Greek peplum. This voluptuous garment of the pagan priestesses
      lessened the indecency of the rest of the attire which the fashions of the
      time suffered women to wear. To soften its immodesty still further, Marie
      threw a gauze scarf over her shoulders, left bare and far too low by the
      red drapery. She wound the long braids of her hair into the flat irregular
      cone above the nape of the neck which gives such grace to certain antique
      statues by an artistic elongation of the head, while a few stray locks
      escaping from her forehead fell in shining curls beside her cheeks. With a
      form and head thus dressed, she presented a perfect likeness of the noble
      masterpieces of Greek sculpture. She smiled as she looked with approval at
      the arrangement of her hair, which brought out the beauties of her face,
      while the scarlet berries of the holly wreath which she laid upon it
      repeated charmingly the color of the peplum. As she twisted and turned a
      few leaves, to give capricious diversity to their arrangement, she
      examined her whole costume in a mirror to judge of its general effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am horrible to-night,&rdquo; she said, as though she were surrounded by
      flatterers. &ldquo;I look like a statue of Liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She placed the dagger carefully in her bosom leaving the rubies in the
      hilt exposed, their ruddy reflections attracting the eye to the hidden
      beauties of her shape. Francine could not bring herself to leave her
      mistress. When Marie was ready she made various pretexts to follow her.
      She must help her to take off her mantle, and the overshoes which the mud
      and muck in the streets compelled her to wear (though the roads had been
      sanded for this occasion); also the gauze veil which Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil had thrown over her head to conceal her features from the Chouans
      who were collecting in the streets to watch the company. The crowd was in
      fact so great that they were forced to make their way through two hedges
      of Chouans. Francine no longer strove to detain her mistress, and after
      giving a few last touches to a costume the greatest charm of which was its
      exquisite freshness, she stationed herself in the courtyard that she might
      not abandon this beloved mistress to her fate without being able to fly to
      her succor; for the poor girl foresaw only evil in these events.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange scene was taking place in Montauran&rsquo;s chamber as Marie was on
      her way to the ball. The young marquis, who had just finished dressing,
      was putting on the broad red ribbon which distinguished him as first in
      rank of the assembly, when the Abbe Gudin entered the room with an anxious
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le marquis, come quickly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You alone can quell a
      tumult which has broken out, I don&rsquo;t know why, among the leaders. They
      talk of abandoning the king&rsquo;s cause. I think that devil of a Rifoel is at
      the bottom of it. Such quarrels are always caused by some mere nonsense.
      Madame du Gua reproached him, so I hear, for coming to the ball
      ill-dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman must be crazy,&rdquo; cried the marquis, &ldquo;to try to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rifoel retorted,&rdquo; continued the abbe, interrupting his chief, &ldquo;that if
      you had given him the money promised him in the king&rsquo;s name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, enough; I understand it all now. This scene has all been
      arranged, and you are put forward as ambassador&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, monsieur le marquis!&rdquo; said the abbe, again interrupting him. &ldquo;I am
      supporting you vigorously, and you will, I hope, do me the justice to
      believe that the restoration of our altars in France and that of the king
      upon the throne of his fathers are far more powerful incentives to my
      humble labors than the bishopric of Rennes which you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbe dared say no more, for the marquis smiled bitterly at his last
      words. However, the young chief instantly repressed all expression of
      feeling, his brow grew stern, and he followed the Abbe Gudin into a hall
      where the worst of the clamor was echoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognize no authority here,&rdquo; Rifoel was saying, casting angry looks at
      all about him and laying his hand on the hilt of his sabre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize that of common-sense?&rdquo; asked the marquis, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Chevalier de Vissard, better known under his patronymic of
      Rifoel, was silent before the general of the Catholic armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this about, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked the marquis, examining the
      faces round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; said a famous smuggler, with the awkwardness
      of a man of the people who long remains under the yoke of respect to a
      great lord, though he admits no barriers after he has once jumped them,
      and regards the aristocrat as an equal only, &ldquo;<i>this</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      you have come in the nick of time to hear it. I am no speaker of gilded
      phrases, and I shall say things plainly. I commanded five hundred men
      during the late war. Since we have taken up arms again I have raised a
      thousand heads as hard as mine for the service of the king. It is now
      seven years that I have risked my life in the good cause; I don&rsquo;t blame
      you, but I say that the laborer is worthy of his hire. Now, to begin with,
      I demand that I be called Monsieur de Cottereau. I also demand that the
      rank of colonel shall be granted me, or I send in my adhesion to the First
      Consul! Let me tell you, monsieur le marquis, my men and I have a
      devilishly importunate creditor who must be satisfied&mdash;he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; he
      added, striking his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the musicians come?&rdquo; said the marquis, in a contemptuous tone,
      turning to Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the smuggler had dealt boldly with an important topic, and the
      calculating, ambitious minds of those present had been too long in
      suspense as to what they might hope for from the king to allow the scorn
      of their new leader to put an end to the scene. Rifoel hastily blocked the
      way before Montauran, and seized his hand to oblige him to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are treating far too
      lightly men who have a right to the gratitude of him whom you are here to
      represent. We know that his Majesty has sent you with full powers to judge
      of our services, and we say that they ought to be recognized and rewarded,
      for we risk our heads upon the scaffold daily. I know, so far as I am
      concerned, that the rank of brigadier-general&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur le marquis; Charette made me a colonel. The rank I mention
      cannot be denied me. I am not arguing for myself, I speak for my brave
      brothers-in-arms, whose services ought to be recorded. Your signature and
      your promise will suffice them for the present; though,&rdquo; he added, in a
      low voice, &ldquo;I must say they are satisfied with very little. But,&rdquo; he
      continued, raising his voice, &ldquo;when the sun rises on the chateau of
      Versailles to glorify the return of the monarchy after the faithful have
      conquered France, <i>in France</i>, for the king, will they obtain favors
      for their families, pensions for widows, and the restitution of their
      confiscated property? I doubt it. But, monsieur le marquis, we must have
      certified proof of our services when that time comes. I will never
      distrust the king, but I do distrust those cormorants of ministers and
      courtiers, who tingle his ears with talk about the public welfare, the
      honor of France, the interests of the crown, and other crochets. They will
      sneer at a loyal Vendean or a brave Chouan, because he is old and the
      sword he drew for the good cause dangles on his withered legs, palsied
      with exposure. Can you say that we are wrong in feeling thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk well, Monsieur du Vissard, but you are over hasty,&rdquo; replied the
      marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, marquis,&rdquo; said the Comte de Bauvan, in a whisper. &ldquo;Rifoel has
      really, on my word, told the truth. You are sure, yourself, to have the
      ear of the king, while the rest of us only see him at a distance and from
      time to time. I will own to you that if you do not give me your word as a
      gentleman that I shall, in due course of time, obtain the place of Master
      of Woods and Waters in France, the devil take me if I will risk my neck
      any longer. To conquer Normandy for the king is not an easy matter, and I
      demand the Order for it. But,&rdquo; he added, coloring, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s time enough to
      think of that. God forbid that I should imitate these poor mercenaries and
      harass you. Speak to the king for me, and that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each of the chiefs found means to let the marquis know, in a more or less
      ingenious manner, the exaggerated price they set upon their services. One
      modestly demanded the governorship of Brittany; another a barony; this one
      a promotion; that one a command; and all wanted pensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, baron,&rdquo; said the marquis to Monsieur du Guenic, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen have left me nothing but the crown of France, marquis,
      but I might manage to put up with that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; cried the Abbe Gudin, in a loud voice, &ldquo;remember that if you
      are too eager you will spoil everything in the day of victory. The king
      will then be compelled to make concessions to the revolutionists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those Jacobins!&rdquo; shouted the smuggler. &ldquo;Ha! if the king would let me
      have my way, I&rsquo;d answer for my thousand men; we&rsquo;d soon wring their necks
      and be rid of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur <i>de</i> Cottereau,&rdquo; said the marquis, &ldquo;I see some of our
      invited guests arriving. We must all do our best by attention and courtesy
      to make them share our sacred enterprise; you will agree, I am sure, that
      this is not the moment to bring forward your demands, however just they
      may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the marquis went to the door, as if to meet certain of the
      country nobles who were entering the room, but the bold smuggler barred
      his way in a respectful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, monsieur le marquis, excuse me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the Jacobins taught me
      too well in 1793 that it is not he who sows and reaps who eats the bread.
      Sign this bit of paper for me, and to-morrow I&rsquo;ll bring you fifteen
      hundred gars. If not, I&rsquo;ll treat with the First Consul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking haughtily about him, the marquis saw plainly that the boldness of
      the old partisan and his resolute air were not displeasing to any of the
      spectators of this debate. One man alone, sitting by himself in a corner
      of the room, appeared to take no part in the scene, and to be chiefly
      occupied in filling his pipe. The contemptuous air with which he glanced
      at the speakers, his modest demeanor, and a look of sympathy which the
      marquis encountered in his eyes, made the young leader observe the man,
      whom he then recognized as Major Brigaut, and he went suddenly up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, what do you want?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur le marquis, if the king comes back that&rsquo;s all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself? are you joking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis pressed the horny hand of the Breton, and said to Madame du
      Gua, who was near them: &ldquo;Madame, I may perish in this enterprise before I
      have time to make a faithful report to the king on the Catholic armies of
      Brittany. I charge you, in case you live to see the Restoration, not to
      forget this honorable man nor the Baron du Guenic. There is more devotion
      in them than in all those other men put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the chiefs, who were waiting with some impatience till the
      marquis should reply to their demands. They were all holding papers in
      their hands, on which, no doubt, their services were recorded over the
      signatures of the various generals of the former war; and all were
      murmuring. The Abbe Gudin, the Comte de Bauvan, and the Baron du Guenic
      were consulting how best to help the marquis in rejecting these
      extravagant demands, for they felt the position of the young leader to be
      extremely delicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the marquis ran his blue eyes, gleaming with satire, over the
      whole assembly, and said in a clear voice: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I do not know
      whether the powers which the king has graciously assigned to me are such
      that I am able to satisfy your demands. He doubtless did not foresee such
      zeal, such devotion, on your part. You shall judge yourselves of the
      duties put upon me,&mdash;duties which I shall know how to accomplish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he left the room and returned immediately holding in his hand
      an open letter bearing the royal seal and signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the letters-patent in virtue of which you are to obey me,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;They authorize me to govern the provinces of Brittany, Normandy,
      Maine, and Anjou, in the king&rsquo;s name, and to recognize the services of
      such officers as may distinguish themselves in his armies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A movement of satisfaction ran through the assembly. The Chouans
      approached the marquis and made a respectful circle round him. All eyes
      fastened on the king&rsquo;s signature. The young chief, who was standing near
      the chimney, suddenly threw the letters into the fire, and they were
      burned in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not choose to command any,&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;but those who see
      a king in the king, and not a prey to prey upon. You are free, gentlemen,
      to leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua, the Abbe Gudin, Major Brigaut, the Chevalier du Vissard,
      the Baron du Guenic, and the Comte de Bauvan raised the cry of &ldquo;Vive le
      roi!&rdquo; For a moment the other leaders hesitated; then, carried away by the
      noble action of the marquis, they begged him to forget what had passed,
      assuring him that, letters-patent or not, he must always be their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and dance,&rdquo; cried the Comte de Bauvan, &ldquo;and happen what will! After
      all,&rdquo; he added, gaily, &ldquo;it is better, my friends, to pray to God than the
      saints. Let us fight first, and see what comes of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s good advice,&rdquo; said Brigaut. &ldquo;I have never yet known a day&rsquo;s
      pay drawn in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assembly dispersed about the rooms, where the guests were now
      arriving. The marquis tried in vain to shake off the gloom which darkened
      his face. The chiefs perceived the unfavorable impression made upon a
      young man whose devotion was still surrounded by all the beautiful
      illusions of youth, and they were ashamed of their action.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a joyous gaiety soon enlivened the opening of the ball, at which
      were present the most important personages of the royalist party, who,
      unable to judge rightly, in the depths of a rebellious province, of the
      actual events of the Revolution, mistook their hopes for realities. The
      bold operations already begun by Montauran, his name, his fortune, his
      capacity, raised their courage and caused that political intoxication, the
      most dangerous of all excitements, which does not cool till torrents of
      blood have been uselessly shed. In the minds of all present the Revolution
      was nothing more than a passing trouble to the kingdom of France, where,
      to their belated eyes, nothing was changed. The country belonged as it
      ever did to the house of Bourbon. The royalists were the lords of the soil
      as completely as they were four years earlier, when Hoche obtained less a
      peace than an armistice. The nobles made light of the revolutionists; for
      them Bonaparte was another, but more fortunate, Marceau. So gaiety
      reigned. The women had come to dance. A few only of the chiefs, who had
      fought the Blues, knew the gravity of the situation; but they were well
      aware that if they talked of the First Consul and his power to their
      benighted companions, they could not make themselves understood. These men
      stood apart and looked at the women with indifference. Madame du Gua, who
      seemed to do the honors of the ball, endeavored to quiet the impatience of
      the dancers by dispensing flatteries to each in turn. The musicians were
      tuning their instruments and the dancing was about to begin, when Madame
      du Gua noticed the gloom on de Montauran&rsquo;s face and went hurriedly up to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it is not that vulgar scene you have just had with those
      clodhoppers which depresses you?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got no answer; the marquis, absorbed in thought, was listening in
      fancy to the prophetic reasons which Marie had given him in the midst of
      the same chiefs at La Vivetiere, urging him to abandon the struggle of
      kings against peoples. But the young man&rsquo;s soul was too proud, too lofty,
      too full perhaps of conviction, to abandon an enterprise he had once
      begun, and he decided at this moment, to continue it boldly in the face of
      all obstacles. He raised his head haughtily, and for the first time
      noticed that Madame du Gua was speaking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mind is no doubt at Fougeres,&rdquo; she remarked bitterly, seeing how
      useless her efforts to attract his attention had been. &ldquo;Ah, monsieur, I
      would give my life to put <i>her</i> within your power, and see you happy
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you done all you could to kill her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wish her dead or in your arms. Yes, I may have loved the
      Marquis de Montauran when I thought him a hero, but now I feel only a
      pitying friendship for him; I see him shorn of all his glory by a fickle
      love for a worthless woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for love,&rdquo; said the marquis, in a sarcastic tone, &ldquo;you judge me wrong.
      If I loved that girl, madame, I might desire her less; if it were not for
      you, perhaps I should not think of her at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame du Gua, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The haste with which the marquis looked round went to the heart of the
      woman; but the clear light of the wax candles enabled her to see every
      change on the face of the man she loved so violently, and when he turned
      back his face, smiling at her woman&rsquo;s trick, she fancied there was still
      some hope of recovering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; asked the Comte de Bauvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a soap-bubble which has burst,&rdquo; interposed Madame du Gua, gaily. &ldquo;The
      marquis, if we are now to believe him, is astonished that his heart ever
      beat the faster for that girl who presumes to call herself Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil. You know who I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl!&rdquo; echoed the count. &ldquo;Madame, the author of a wrong is bound to
      repair it. I give you my word of honor that she is really the daughter of
      the Duc de Verneuil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le comte,&rdquo; said the marquis, in a changed voice, &ldquo;which of your
      statements am I to believe,&mdash;that of La Vivetiere, or that now made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loud voice of a servant at the door announced Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil. The count sprang forward instantly, offered his hand to the
      beautiful woman with every mark of profound respect, and led her through
      the inquisitive crowd to the marquis and Madame du Gua. &ldquo;Believe the one
      now made,&rdquo; he replied to the astonished young leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua turned pale at the unwelcome sight of the girl, who stood
      for a moment, glancing proudly over the assembled company, among whom she
      sought to find the guests at La Vivetiere. She awaited the forced
      salutation of her rival, and, without even looking at the marquis, she
      allowed the count to lead her to the place of honor beside Madame du Gua,
      whose bow she returned with an air that was slightly protecting. But the
      latter, with a woman&rsquo;s instinct, took no offense; on the contrary, she
      immediately assumed a smiling, friendly manner. The extraordinary dress
      and beauty of Mademoiselle de Verneuil caused a murmur throughout the
      ballroom. When the marquis and Madame du Gua looked towards the late
      guests at La Vivetiere they saw them in an attitude of respectful
      admiration which was not assumed; each seemed desirous of recovering favor
      with the misjudged young woman. The enemies were in presence of each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really magic, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua; &ldquo;there is no one
      like you for surprises. Have you come all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All alone,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;So you have only one to
      kill to-night, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be merciful,&rdquo; said Madame du Gua. &ldquo;I cannot express to you the pleasure I
      have in seeing you again. I have truly been overwhelmed by the remembrance
      of the wrongs I have done you, and am most anxious for an occasion to
      repair them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for those wrongs, madame, I readily pardon those you did to me, but my
      heart bleeds for the Blues whom you murdered. However, I excuse all, in
      return for the service you have done me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua lost countenance as she felt her hand pressed by her
      beautiful rival with insulting courtesy. The marquis had hitherto stood
      motionless, but he now seized the arm of the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have shamefully misled me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have compromised my honor.
      I am not a Geronte of comedy, and I shall have your life or you will have
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; said the count, haughtily, &ldquo;I am ready to give you all the
      explanations you desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into the next room. The witnesses of this scene, even those
      least initiated into the secret, began to understand its nature, so that
      when the musicians gave the signal for the dancing to begin no one moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, what service have I rendered you that deserves a return?&rdquo;
       said Madame du Gua, biting her lips in a sort of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not enlighten me as to the true character of the Marquis de
      Montauran, madame? With what utter indifference that man allowed me to go
      to my death! I give him up to you willingly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo; asked Madame du Gua, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To recover the respect and consideration you took from me at La
      Vivetiere, madame. As for all the rest, make yourself easy. Even if the
      marquis returned to me, you know very well that a return is never love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua took Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s hand with that affectionate
      touch and motion which women practise to each other, especially in the
      presence of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my poor dear child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am glad to find you so
      reasonable. If the service I did you was rather harsh,&rdquo; she added,
      pressing the hand she held, and feeling a desire to rend it as her fingers
      felt its softness and delicacy, &ldquo;it shall at least be thorough. Listen to
      me, I know the character of the Gars; he meant to deceive you; he neither
      can nor will marry any woman except&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle, he has accepted his dangerous mission to win the hand
      of Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Uxelles, a marriage to which his Majesty has promised
      his countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil added not a word to that scornful ejaculation.
      The young and handsome Chevalier du Vissard, eager to be forgiven for the
      joke which had led to the insults at La Vivetiere, now came up to her and
      respectfully invited her to dance. She placed her hand in his, and they
      took their places in a quadrille opposite to Madame du Gua. The gowns of
      the royalist women, which recalled the fashions of the exiled court, and
      their creped and powdered hair seemed absurd as soon as they were
      contrasted with the attire which republican fashions authorized
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil to wear. This attire, which was elegant, rich,
      and yet severe, was loudly condemned but inwardly envied by all the women
      present. The men could not restrain their admiration for the beauty of her
      natural hair and the adjustment of a dress the charm of which was in the
      proportions of the form which it revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the marquis and the count re-entered the ballroom behind
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who did not turn her head. If a mirror had not
      been there to inform her of Montauran&rsquo;s presence, she would have known it
      from Madame du Gua&rsquo;s face, which scarcely concealed, under an apparently
      indifferent air, the impatience with which she awaited the conflict which
      must, sooner or later, take place between the lovers. Though the marquis
      talked with the count and other persons, he heard the remarks of all the
      dancers who from time to time in the mazes of the quadrille took the place
      of Mademoiselle de Verneuil and her partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively, madame, she came alone,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a bold woman,&rdquo; replied the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were dressed like that I should feel myself naked,&rdquo; said another
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the gown is not decent, certainly,&rdquo; replied her partner; &ldquo;but it is
      so becoming, and she is so handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed to look at such perfect dancing, for her sake; isn&rsquo;t it
      exactly that of an opera girl?&rdquo; said the envious woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that she has come here to intrigue for the First Consul?&rdquo;
       said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A joke if she has,&rdquo; replied the partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t offer innocence as a dowry,&rdquo; said the lady, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gars turned abruptly to see the lady who uttered this sarcasm, and
      Madame du Gua looked at him as if to say, &ldquo;You see what people think of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the count, laughing, &ldquo;so far, it is only women who have
      taken her innocence away from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis privately forgave the count. When he ventured to look at his
      mistress, whose beauty was, like that of most women, brought into relief
      by the light of the wax candles, she turned her back upon him as she
      resumed her place, and went on talking to her partner in a way to let the
      marquis hear the sweetest and most caressing tones of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The First Consul sends dangerous ambassadors,&rdquo; her partner was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;you all said that at La Vivetiere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the memory of a king,&rdquo; replied he, disconcerted at his own
      awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To forgive injuries one must needs remember them,&rdquo; she said quickly,
      relieving his embarrassment with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we all included in that amnesty?&rdquo; said the marquis, approaching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she darted away in the dance, with the gaiety of a child, leaving him
      without an answer. He watched her coldly and sadly; she saw it, and bent
      her head with one of those coquettish motions which the graceful lines of
      her throat enabled her to make, omitting no movement or attitude which
      could prove to him the perfection of her figure. She attracted him like
      hope, and eluded him like a memory. To see her thus was to desire to
      possess her at any cost. She knew that, and the sense it gave her of her
      own beauty shed upon her whole person an inexpressible charm. The marquis
      felt the storm of love, of rage, of madness, rising in his heart; he wrung
      the count&rsquo;s hand violently, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, returning to her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count gave her a glance and passed into the next room, from which he
      presently returned accompanied by the Gars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mine!&rdquo; she thought, observing his face in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received the young leader with a displeased air and said nothing, but
      she smiled as she turned away from him; he was so superior to all about
      him that she was proud of being able to rule him; and obeying an instinct
      which sways all women more or less, she resolved to let him know the value
      of a few gracious words by making him pay dear for them. As soon as the
      quadrille was over, all the gentlemen who had been at La Vivetiere
      surrounded Mademoiselle de Verneuil, wishing by their flattering
      attentions to obtain her pardon for the mistake they had made; but he whom
      she longed to see at her feet did not approach the circle over which she
      now reigned a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks I still love him,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and does not wish to be
      confounded with mere flatterers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She refused to dance again. Then, as if the ball were given for her, she
      walked about on the arm of the Comte de Bauvan, to whom she was pleased to
      show some familiarity. The affair at La Vivetiere was by this time known
      to all present, thanks to Madame du Gua, and the lovers were the object of
      general attention. The marquis dared not again address his mistress; a
      sense of the wrong he had done her and the violence of his returning
      passion made her seem to him actually terrible. On her side Marie watched
      his apparently calm face while she seemed to be observing the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fearfully hot here,&rdquo; she said to the count. &ldquo;Take me to the other
      side where I can breathe; I am stifling here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she motioned towards a small room where a few card-players were
      assembled. The marquis followed her. He ventured to hope she had left the
      crowd to receive him, and this supposed favor roused his passion to
      extreme violence; for his love had only increased through the resistance
      he had made to it during the last few days. Mademoiselle de Verneuil still
      tormented him; her eyes, so soft and velvety for the count, were hard and
      stern when, as if by accident, they met his. Montauran at last made a
      painful effort and said, in a muffled voice, &ldquo;Will you never forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love forgives nothing, or it forgives all,&rdquo; she said, coldly. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she
      added, noticing his joyful look, &ldquo;it must be love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the count&rsquo;s arm once more and moved forward into a small boudoir
      which adjoined the cardroom. The marquis followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not hear me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would really think, monsieur,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that I had come here to
      meet you, and not to vindicate my own self-respect. If you do not cease
      this odious pursuit I shall leave the ballroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, recollecting one of the crazy actions of the last Duc de
      Lorraine, &ldquo;let me speak to you so long as I can hold this live coal in my
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to the hearth and picking up a brand held it tightly.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil flushed, took her arm from that of the count, and
      looked at the marquis in amazement. The count softly withdrew, leaving
      them alone together. So crazy an action shook Marie&rsquo;s heart, for there is
      nothing so persuasive in love as courageous folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You only prove to me,&rdquo; she said, trying to make him throw away the brand,
      &ldquo;that you are willing to make me suffer cruelly. You are extreme in
      everything. On the word of a fool and the slander of a woman you suspected
      that one who had just saved your life was capable of betraying you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;I have been very cruel to you; but nevertheless,
      forget it; I shall never forget it. Hear me. I have been shamefully
      deceived; but so many circumstances on that fatal day told against you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those circumstances were stronger than your love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; she made a motion of contempt, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marie. I shall never cease to believe in you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then throw that fire away. You are mad. Open your hand; I insist upon
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took delight in still resisting the soft efforts of her fingers, but
      she succeeded in opening the hand she would fain have kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good did that do you?&rdquo; she said, as she tore her handkerchief and
      laid it on the burn, which the marquis covered with his glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame du Gua had stolen softly into the cardroom, watching the lovers
      with furtive eyes, but escaping theirs adroitly; it was, however,
      impossible for her to understand their conversation from their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all that they said of me was true you must admit that I am avenged at
      this moment,&rdquo; said Marie, with a look of malignity which startled the
      marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What feeling brought you here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose, my dear friend, that you can despise a woman like me with
      impunity? I came here for your sake and for my own,&rdquo; she continued, after
      a pause, laying her hand on the hilt of rubies in her bosom and showing
      him the blade of her dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does all that mean?&rdquo; thought Madame du Gua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;you still love me; at any rate, you desire me, and
      the folly you have just committed,&rdquo; she added, taking his hand, &ldquo;proves it
      to me. I will again be that I desired to be; and I return to Fougeres
      happy. Love absolves everything. You love me; I have regained the respect
      of the man who represents to me the whole world, and I can die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you still love me?&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I said so?&rdquo; she replied with a scornful look, delighting in the
      torture she was making him endure. &ldquo;I have run many risks to come here. I
      have saved Monsieur de Bauvan&rsquo;s life, and he, more grateful than others,
      offers me in return his fortune and his name. You have never even thought
      of doing that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis, bewildered by these words, stifled the worst anger he had
      ever felt, supposing that the count had played him false. He made no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you reflect,&rdquo; she said, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;your doubts justify mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us leave this room,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, catching sight of
      a corner of Madame du Gua&rsquo;s gown, and rising. But the wish to reduce her
      rival to despair was too strong, and she made no further motion to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to drive me to hell?&rdquo; cried the marquis, seizing her hand and
      pressing it violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not drive me to hell five days ago? are you not leaving me at
      this very moment uncertain whether your love is sincere or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do I know whether your revenge may not lead you to obtain my life
      to tarnish it, instead of killing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you do not love me! you think of yourself and not of me!&rdquo; she said
      angrily, shedding a few tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coquettish creature well knew the power of her eyes when moistened by
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he cried, beside himself, &ldquo;take my life, but dry those
      tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my love! my love!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a stifled voice: &ldquo;those are the
      words, the accents, the looks I have longed for, to allow me to prefer
      your happiness to mine. But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I ask one more proof of your
      love, which you say is so great. I wish to stay here only so long as may
      be needed to show the company that you are mine. I will not even drink a
      glass of water in the house of a woman who has twice tried to kill me, who
      is now, perhaps, plotting mischief against us,&rdquo; and she showed the marquis
      the floating corner of Madame du Gua&rsquo;s drapery. Then she dried her eyes
      and put her lips to the ear of the young man, who quivered as he felt the
      caress of her warm breath. &ldquo;See that everything is prepared for my
      departure,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you shall take me yourself to Fougeres and there
      only will I tell you if I love you. For the second time I trust you. Will
      you trust me a second time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Marie, you have brought me to a point where I know not what I do. I
      am intoxicated by your words, your looks, by you&mdash;by you, and I am
      ready to obey you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, make me for an instant very happy. Let me enjoy the only
      triumph I desire. I want to breathe freely, to drink of the life I have
      dreamed, to feed my illusions before they are gone forever. Come&mdash;come
      into the ballroom and dance with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They re-entered the room together, and though Mademoiselle de Verneuil was
      as completely satisfied in heart and vanity as any woman ever could be,
      the unfathomable gentleness of her eyes, the demure smile on her lips, the
      rapidity of the motions of a gay dance, kept the secret of her thoughts as
      the sea swallows those of the criminal who casts a weighted body into its
      depths. But a murmur of admiration ran through the company as, circling in
      each other&rsquo;s arms, voluptuously interlaced, with heavy heads, and dimmed
      sight, they waltzed with a sort of frenzy, dreaming of the pleasures they
      hoped to find in a future union.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Mademoiselle de Verneuil and the marquis were in the
      latter&rsquo;s travelling-carriage drawn by four horses. Surprised to see these
      enemies hand in hand, and evidently understanding each other, Francine
      kept silence, not daring to ask her mistress whether her conduct was that
      of treachery or love. Thanks to the darkness, the marquis did not observe
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s agitation as they neared Fougeres. The first
      flush of dawn showed the towers of Saint-Leonard in the distance. At that
      moment Marie was saying to herself: &ldquo;I am going to my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they ascended the first hill the lovers had the same thought; they left
      the carriage and mounted the rise on foot, in memory of their first
      meeting. When Marie took the young man&rsquo;s arm she thanked him by a smile
      for respecting her silence; then, as they reached the summit of the
      plateau and looked at Fougeres, she threw off her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any farther,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my authority cannot save you from the
      Blues to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montauran showed some surprise. She smiled sadly and pointed to a block of
      granite, as if to tell him to sit down, while she herself stood before him
      in a melancholy attitude. The rending emotions of her soul no longer
      permitted her to play a part. At that moment she would have knelt on
      red-hot coals without feeling them any more than the marquis had felt the
      fire-brand he had taken in his hand to prove the strength of his passion.
      It was not until she had contemplated her lover with a look of the deepest
      anguish that she said to him, at last:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you have suspected of me is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I pray you,&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands, &ldquo;listen to me without
      interruption. I am indeed the daughter of the Duc de Verneuil,&mdash;but
      his natural daughter. My mother, a Demoiselle de Casteran, who became a
      nun to escape the reproaches of her family, expiated her fault by fifteen
      years of sorrow, and died at Seez, where she was abbess. On her death-bed
      she implored, for the first time and only for me, the help of the man who
      had betrayed her, for she knew she was leaving me without friends, without
      fortune, without a future. The duke accepted the charge, and took me from
      the roof of Francine&rsquo;s mother, who had hitherto taken care of me; perhaps
      he liked me because I was beautiful; possibly I reminded him of his youth.
      He was one of those great lords of the old regime, who took pride in
      showing how they could get their crimes forgiven by committing them with
      grace. I will say no more, he was my father. But let me explain to you how
      my life in Paris injured my soul. The society of the Duc de Verneuil, to
      which he introduced me, was bitten by that scoffing philosophy about which
      all France was then enthusiastic because it was wittily professed. The
      brilliant conversations which charmed my ear were marked by subtlety of
      perception and by witty contempt for all that was true and spiritual. Men
      laughed at sentiments, and pictured them all the better because they did
      not feel them; their satirical epigrams were as fascinating as the
      light-hearted humor with which they could put a whole adventure into a
      word; and yet they had sometimes too much wit, and wearied women by making
      love an art, and not a matter of feeling. I could not resist the tide. And
      yet my soul was too ardent&mdash;forgive this pride&mdash;not to feel that
      their minds had withered their hearts; and the life I led resulted in a
      perpetual struggle between my natural feelings and beliefs and the vicious
      habits of mind which I there contracted. Several superior men took
      pleasure in developing in me that liberty of thought and contempt for
      public opinion which do tear from a woman her modesty of soul, robbed of
      which she loses her charm. Alas! my subsequent misfortunes have failed to
      lessen the faults I learned through opulence. My father,&rdquo; she continued,
      with a sigh, &ldquo;the Duc de Verneuil, died, after duly recognizing me as his
      daughter and making provisions for me by his will, which considerably
      reduced the fortune of my brother, his legitimate son. I found myself one
      day without a home and without a protector. My brother contested the will
      which made me rich. Three years of my late life had developed my vanity.
      By satisfying all my fancies my father had created in my nature a need of
      luxury, and given me habits of self-indulgence of which my own mind, young
      and artless as it then was, could not perceive either the danger or the
      tyranny. A friend of my father, the Marechal Duc de Lenoncourt, then
      seventy years old, offered to become my guardian, and I found myself, soon
      after the termination of the odious suit, in a brilliant home, where I
      enjoyed all the advantages of which my brother&rsquo;s cruelty had deprived me.
      Every evening the old marechal came to sit with me and comfort me with
      kind and consoling words. His white hair and the many proofs he gave me of
      paternal tenderness led me to turn all the feelings of my heart upon him,
      and I felt myself his daughter. I accepted his presents, hiding none of my
      caprices from him, for I saw how he loved to gratify them. I heard one
      fatal evening that all Paris believed me the mistress of the poor old man.
      I was told that it was then beyond my power to recover an innocence thus
      gratuitously denied me. They said that the man who had abused my
      inexperience could not be lover, and would not be my husband. The week in
      which I made this horrible discovery the duke left Paris. I was shamefully
      ejected from the house where he had placed me, and which did not belong to
      him. Up to this point I have told you the truth as though I stood before
      God; but now, do not ask a wretched woman to give account of sufferings
      which are buried in her heart. The time came when I found myself married
      to Danton. A few days later the storm uprooted the mighty oak around which
      I had thrown my arms. Again I was plunged into the worst distress, and I
      resolved to kill myself. I don&rsquo;t know whether love of life, or the hope of
      wearying ill-fortune and of finding at the bottom of the abyss the
      happiness which had always escaped me were, unconsciously to myself, my
      advisers, or whether I was fascinated by the arguments of a young man from
      Vendome, who, for the last two years, has wound himself about me like a
      serpent round a tree,&mdash;in short, I know not how it is that I
      accepted, for a payment of three hundred thousand francs, the odious
      mission of making an unknown man fall in love with me and then betraying
      him. I met you; I knew you at once by one of those presentiments which
      never mislead us; yet I tried to doubt my recognition, for the more I came
      to love you, the more the certainty appalled me. When I saved you from the
      hands of Hulot, I abjured the part I had taken; I resolved to betray the
      slaughterers, and not their victim. I did wrong to play with men, with
      their lives, their principles, with myself, like a thoughtless girl who
      sees only sentiments in this life. I believed you loved me; I let myself
      cling to the hope that my life might begin anew; but all things have
      revealed my past,&mdash;even I myself, perhaps, for you must have
      distrusted a woman so passionate as you have found me. Alas! is there no
      excuse for my love and my deception? My life was like a troubled sleep; I
      woke and thought myself a girl; I was in Alencon, where all my memories
      were pure and chaste. I had the mad simplicity to think that love would
      baptize me into innocence. For a moment I thought myself pure, for I had
      never loved. But last night your passion seemed to me true, and a voice
      cried to me, &lsquo;Do not deceive him.&rsquo; Monsieur le marquis,&rdquo; she said, in a
      guttural voice which haughtily challenged condemnation, &ldquo;know this; I am a
      dishonored creature, unworthy of you. From this hour I accept my fate as a
      lost woman. I am weary of playing a part,&mdash;the part of a woman to
      whom you had brought back the sanctities of her soul. Virtue is a burden
      to me. I should despise you if you were weak enough to marry me. The Comte
      de Bauvan might commit that folly, but you&mdash;you must be worthy of
      your future and leave me without regret. A courtesan is too exacting; I
      should not love you like the simple, artless girl who felt for a moment
      the delightful hope of being your companion, of making you happy, of doing
      you honor, of becoming a noble wife. But I gather from that futile hope
      the courage to return to a life of vice and infamy, that I may put an
      eternal barrier between us. I sacrifice both honor and fortune to you. The
      pride I take in that sacrifice will support me in my wretchedness,&mdash;fate
      may dispose of me as it will. I will never betray you. I shall return to
      Paris. There your name will be to me a part of myself, and the glory you
      win will console my grief. As for you, you are a man, and you will forget
      me. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She darted away in the direction of the gorges of Saint-Sulpice, and
      disappeared before the marquis could rise to detain her. But she came back
      unseen, hid herself in a cavity of the rocks, and examined the young man
      with a curiosity mingled with doubt. Presently she saw him walking like a
      man overwhelmed, without seeming to know where he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he be weak?&rdquo; she thought, when he had disappeared, and she felt she
      was parted from him. &ldquo;Will he understand me?&rdquo; She quivered. Then she
      turned and went rapidly towards Fougeres, as though she feared the marquis
      might follow her into the town, where certain death awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine, what did he say to you?&rdquo; she asked, when the faithful girl
      rejoined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Marie, how I pitied him. You great ladies stab a man with your
      tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he seem when he came up to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if he saw me not at all! Oh, Marie, he loves you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he loves me, or he does not love me&mdash;there is heaven or hell
      for me in that,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Between the two extremes there is no spot
      where I can set my foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After thus carrying out her resolution, Marie gave way to grief, and her
      face, beautified till then by these conflicting sentiments, changed for
      the worse so rapidly that in a single day, during which she floated
      incessantly between hope and despair, she lost the glow of beauty, and the
      freshness which has its source in the absence of passion or the ardor of
      joy. Anxious to ascertain the result of her mad enterprise, Hulot and
      Corentin came to see her soon after her return. She received them smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said to the commandant, whose care-worn face had a questioning
      expression, &ldquo;the fox is coming within range of your guns; you will soon
      have a glorious triumph over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Corentin, carelessly, giving Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil one of those oblique glances with which diplomatists of his class
      spy on thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Gars is more in love than ever; I made him come with
      me to the gates of Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your power seems to have stopped there,&rdquo; remarked Corentin; &ldquo;the fears of
      your <i>ci-devant</i> are greater than the love you inspire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You judge him by yourself,&rdquo; she replied, with a contemptuous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, unmoved, &ldquo;why did you not bring him here to your
      own house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; she said to Hulot, with a coaxing smile, &ldquo;if he really loves
      me, would you blame me for saving his life and getting him to leave
      France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier came quickly up to her, took her hand, and kissed it with
      a sort of enthusiasm. Then he looked at her fixedly and said in a gloomy
      tone: &ldquo;You forget my two friends and my sixty-three men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, commandant,&rdquo; she cried, with all the naivete of passion, &ldquo;he was not
      accountable for that; he was deceived by a bad woman, Charette&rsquo;s mistress,
      who would, I do believe, drink the blood of the Blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Marie,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tease the commandant; he does not
      understand such jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and remember that the day when you
      displease me too much will have no morrow for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Hulot, without bitterness, &ldquo;that I must
      prepare for a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not strong enough, my dear colonel. I saw more than six thousand
      men at Saint-James,&mdash;regular troops, artillery, and English officers.
      But they cannot do much unless <i>he</i> leads them? I agree with Fouche,
      his presence is the head and front of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to get his head?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; said Corentin,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English officers!&rdquo; cried Hulot, angrily, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all that was wanting to
      make a regular brigand of him. Ha! ha! I&rsquo;ll give him English, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, citizen-diplomat,&rdquo; said Hulot to Corentin, after the two
      had taken leave and were at some distance from the house, &ldquo;that you allow
      that girl to send you to the right-about when she pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite natural for you, commandant,&rdquo; replied Corentin, with a
      thoughtful air, &ldquo;to see nothing but fighting in what she said to us. You
      soldiers never seem to know there are various ways of making war. To use
      the passions of men and women like wires to be pulled for the benefit of
      the State; to keep the running-gear of the great machine we call
      government in good order, and fasten to it the desires of human nature,
      like baited traps which it is fun to watch,&mdash;I call <i>that</i>
      creating a world, like God, and putting ourselves at the centre of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please allow me to prefer my calling to yours,&rdquo; said the
      soldier, curtly. &ldquo;You can do as you like with your running-gear; I
      recognize no authority but that of the minister of war. I have my orders;
      I shall take the field with veterans who don&rsquo;t skulk, and face an enemy
      you want to catch behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can fight if you want to,&rdquo; replied Corentin. &ldquo;From what that girl
      has dropped, close-mouthed as you think she is, I can tell you that you&rsquo;ll
      have to skirmish about, and I myself will give you the pleasure of an
      interview with the Gars before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Hulot, moving back a step to get a better view of this
      strange individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Verneuil is in love with him,&rdquo; replied Corentin, in a
      thick voice, &ldquo;and perhaps he loves her. A marquis, a knight of
      Saint-Louis, young, brilliant, perhaps rich,&mdash;what a list of
      temptations! She would be foolish indeed not to look after her own
      interests and try to marry him rather than betray him. The girl is
      attempting to fool us. But I saw hesitation in her eyes. They probably
      have a rendezvous; perhaps they&rsquo;ve met already. Well, to-morrow I shall
      have him by the forelock. Yesterday he was nothing more than the enemy of
      the Republic, to-day he is mine; and I tell you this, every man who has
      been so rash as to come between that girl and me has died upon the
      scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Corentin dropped into a reverie which hindered him from
      observing the disgust on the face of the honest soldier as he discovered
      the depths of this intrigue, and the mechanism of the means employed by
      Fouche. Hulot resolved on the spot to thwart Corentin in every way that
      did not conflict essentially with the success of the government, and to
      give the Gars a fair chance of dying honorably, sword in hand, before he
      could fall a prey to the executioner, for whom this agent of the detective
      police acknowledged himself the purveyor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the First Consul would listen to me,&rdquo; thought Hulot, as he turned his
      back on Corentin, &ldquo;he would leave those foxes to fight aristocrats, and
      send his solders on other business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin looked coldly after the old soldier, whose face had brightened at
      the resolve, and his eyes gleamed with a sardonic expression, which showed
      the mental superiority of this subaltern Machiavelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give an ell of blue cloth to those fellows, and hang a bit of iron at
      their waists,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ll think there&rsquo;s but one way
      to kill people.&rdquo; Then, after walking up and down awhile very slowly, he
      exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;Yes, the time has come, that woman shall be mine! For
      five years I&rsquo;ve been drawing the net round her, and I have her now; with
      her, I can be a greater man in the government than Fouche himself. Yes, if
      she loses the only man she has ever loved, grief will give her to me, body
      and soul; but I must be on the watch night and day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the pale face of this man might have been seen through
      the window of a house, from which he could observe all who entered the
      cul-de-sac formed by the line of houses running parallel with
      Saint-Leonard, one of those houses being that now occupied by Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil. With the patience of a cat watching a mouse Corentin was
      there in the same place on the following morning, attentive to the
      slightest noise, and subjecting the passers-by to the closest examination.
      The day that was now beginning was a market-day. Although in these
      calamitous times the peasants rarely risked themselves in the towns,
      Corentin presently noticed a small man with a gloomy face, wrapped in a
      goatskin, and carrying on his arm a small flat basket; he was making his
      way in the direction of Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s house, casting careless
      glances about him. Corentin watched him enter the house; then he ran down
      into the street, meaning to waylay the man as he left; but on second
      thoughts it occurred to him that if he called unexpectedly on Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil he might surprise by a single glance the secret that was
      hidden in the basket of the emissary. Besides, he had already learned that
      it was impossible to extract anything from the inscrutable answers of
      Bretons and Normans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Galope-Chopine!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil, when Francine brought
      the man to her. &ldquo;Does he love me?&rdquo; she murmured to herself, in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinctive hope sent a brilliant color to her cheeks and joy into her
      heart. Galope-Chopine looked alternately from the mistress to the maid
      with evident distrust of the latter; but a sign from Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about two o&rsquo;clock <i>he</i> will be at my house
      waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emotion prevented Mademoiselle de Verneuil from giving any other reply
      than a movement of her head, but the man understood her meaning. At that
      moment Corentin&rsquo;s step was heard in the adjoining room, but Galope-Chopine
      showed no uneasiness, though Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s look and shudder
      warned him of danger, and as soon as the spy had entered the room the
      Chouan raised his voice to an ear-splitting tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he said to Francine, &ldquo;I tell you there&rsquo;s Breton butter <i>and</i>
      Breton butter. You want the Gibarry kind, and you won&rsquo;t give more than
      eleven sous a pound; then why did you send me to fetch it? It is good
      butter that,&rdquo; he added, uncovering the basket to show the pats which
      Barbette had made. &ldquo;You ought to be fair, my good lady, and pay one sou
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hollow voice betrayed no emotion, and his green eyes, shaded by thick
      gray eyebrows, bore Corentin&rsquo;s piercing glance without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my good man, you are not here to sell butter; you are talking
      to a lady who never bargained for a thing in her life. The trade you run,
      old fellow, will shorten you by a head in a very few days&rdquo;; and Corentin,
      with a friendly tap on the man&rsquo;s shoulder, added, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t keep up being
      a spy of the Blues and a spy of the Chouans very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galope-Chopine needed all his presence of mind to subdue his rage, and not
      deny the accusation which his avarice had made a just one. He contented
      himself with saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is making game of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin turned his back on the Chouan, but, while bowing to Mademoiselle
      de Verneuil, whose heart stood still, he watched him in the mirror behind
      her. Galope-Chopine, unaware of this, gave a glance to Francine, to which
      she replied by pointing to the door, and saying, &ldquo;Come with me, my man,
      and we will settle the matter between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing escaped Corentin, neither the fear which Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      could not conceal under a smile, nor her color and the contraction of her
      features, nor the Chouan&rsquo;s sign and Francine&rsquo;s reply; he had seen all.
      Convinced that Galope-Chopine was sent by the marquis, he caught the man
      by the long hairs of his goatskin as he was leaving the room, turned him
      round to face him, and said with a keen look: &ldquo;Where do you live, my man?
      I want butter, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good monsieur,&rdquo; said the Chouan, &ldquo;all Fougeres knows where I live. I
      am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corentin!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle de Verneuil, interrupting
      Galope-Chopine. &ldquo;Why do you come here at this time of day? I am scarcely
      dressed. Let that peasant alone; he does not understand your tricks any
      more than I understand the motive of them. You can go, my man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galope-Chopine hesitated a moment. The indecision, real or feigned, of the
      poor devil, who knew not which to obey, deceived even Corentin; but the
      Chouan, finally, after an imperative gesture from the lady, left the room
      with a dragging step. Mademoiselle de Verneuil and Corentin looked at each
      other in silence. This time Marie&rsquo;s limpid eyes could not endure the gleam
      of cruel fire in the man&rsquo;s look. The resolute manner in which the spy had
      forced his way into her room, an expression on his face which Marie had
      never seen there before, the deadened tones of his shrill voice, his whole
      demeanor,&mdash;all these things alarmed her; she felt that a secret
      struggle was about to take place between them, and that he meant to employ
      against her all the powers of his evil influence. But though she had at
      this moment a full and distinct view of the gulf into which she was
      plunging, she gathered strength from her love to shake off the icy chill
      of these presentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corentin,&rdquo; she said, with a sort of gayety, &ldquo;I hope you are going to let
      me make my toilet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, permit me to call you so,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
      yet know me. Listen; a much less sagacious man than I would see your love
      for the Marquis de Montauran. I have several times offered you my heart
      and hand. You have never thought me worthy of you; and perhaps you are
      right. But however much you may feel yourself too high, too beautiful, too
      superior for me, I can compel you to come down to my level. My ambition
      and my maxims have given you a low opinion of me; frankly, you are
      mistaken. Men are not worth even what I rate them at, and that is next to
      nothing. I shall certainly attain a position which will gratify your
      pride. Who will ever love you better, or make you more absolutely mistress
      of yourself and of him, than the man who has loved you now for five years?
      Though I run the risk of exciting your suspicions,&mdash;for you cannot
      conceive that any one should renounce an idolized woman out of excessive
      love,&mdash;I will now prove to you the unselfishness of my passion. If
      the marquis loves you, marry him; but before you do so, make sure of his
      sincerity. I could not endure to see you deceived, for I do prefer your
      happiness to my own. My resolution may surprise you; lay it to the
      prudence of a man who is not so great a fool as to wish to possess a woman
      against her will. I blame myself, not you, for the failure of my efforts
      to win you. I hoped to do so by submission and devotion, for I have long,
      as you well know, tried to make you happy according to my lights; but you
      have never in any way rewarded me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have suffered you to be near me,&rdquo; she said, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add that you regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After involving me in this infamous enterprise, do you think that I have
      any thanks to give you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I proposed to you an enterprise which was not exempt from blame to
      timid minds,&rdquo; he replied, audaciously, &ldquo;I had only your own prosperity in
      view. As for me, whether I succeed or fail, I can make all results further
      my ends. If you marry Montauran, I shall be delighted to serve the
      Bourbons in Paris, where I am already a member of the Clichy club. Now, if
      circumstances were to put me in correspondence with the princes I should
      abandon the interests of the Republic, which is already on its last legs.
      General Bonaparte is much too able a man not to know that he can&rsquo;t be in
      England and in Italy at the same time, and that is how the Republic is
      about to fall. I have no doubt he made the 18th Brumaire to obtain greater
      advantages over the Bourbons when it came to treating with them. He is a
      long-headed fellow, and very keen; but the politicians will get the better
      of him on their own ground. The betrayal of France is another scruple
      which men of superiority leave to fools. I won&rsquo;t conceal from you that I
      have come here with the necessary authority to open negotiations with the
      Chouans, <i>or</i> to further their destruction, as the case may be; for
      Fouche, my patron, is deep; he has always played a double part; during the
      Terror he was as much for Robespierre as for Danton&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you basely abandoned,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense; he is dead,&mdash;forget him,&rdquo; replied Corentin. &ldquo;Come, speak
      honestly to me; I have set you the example. Old Hulot is deeper than he
      looks; if you want to escape his vigilance, I can help you. Remember that
      he holds all the valleys and will instantly detect a rendezvous. If you
      make one in Fougeres, under his very eyes, you are at the mercy of his
      patrols. See how quickly he knew that this Chouan had entered your house.
      His military sagacity will show him that your movements betray those of
      the Gars&mdash;if Montauran loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil had never listened to a more affectionate voice;
      Corentin certainly seemed sincere, and spoke confidingly. The poor girl&rsquo;s
      heart was so open to generous impressions that she was on the point of
      betraying her secret to the serpent who had her in his folds, when it
      occurred to her that she had no proof beyond his own words of his
      sincerity, and she felt no scruple in blinding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are right, Corentin. I do love the marquis, but he
      does not love me&mdash;at least, I fear so; I can&rsquo;t help fearing that the
      appointment he wishes me to make with him is a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said yesterday that he came as far as Fougeres with you,&rdquo;
       returned Corentin. &ldquo;If he had meant to do you bodily harm you wouldn&rsquo;t be
      here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a cold heart, Corentin. You can draw shrewd conclusions as to the
      ordinary events of human life, but not on those of passion. Perhaps that
      is why you inspire me with such repulsion. As you are so clear-sighted,
      you may be able to tell me why a man from whom I separated myself
      violently two days ago now wishes me to meet him in a house at Florigny on
      the road to Mayenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this avowal, which seemed to escape her with a recklessness that was
      not unnatural in so passionate a creature, Corentin flushed, for he was
      still young; but he gave her a sidelong penetrating look, trying to search
      her soul. The girl&rsquo;s artlessness was so well played, however, that she
      deceived the spy, and he answered with crafty good-humor, &ldquo;Shall I
      accompany you at a distance? I can take a few solders with me, and be
      ready to help and obey you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but promise me, on your honor,&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t
      believe in it; by your salvation,&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t believe in God; by
      your soul,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose you have any! what pledge <i>can</i>
      you give me of your fidelity? and yet you expect me to trust you, and put
      more than my life&mdash;my love, my vengeance&mdash;into your hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight smile which crossed the pallid lips of the spy showed
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil the danger she had just escaped. The man, whose
      nostrils contracted instead of dilating, took the hand of his victim,
      kissed it with every mark of the deepest respect, and left the room with a
      bow that was not devoid of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours after this scene Mademoiselle de Verneuil, who feared the
      man&rsquo;s return, left the town furtively by the Porte Saint-Leonard, and made
      her way through the labyrinth of paths to the cottage of Galope-Chopine,
      led by the dream of at last finding happiness, and also by the purpose of
      saving her lover from the danger that threatened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Corentin had gone to find the commandant. He had some
      difficulty in recognizing Hulot when he found him in a little square,
      where he was busy with certain military preparations. The brave veteran
      had made a sacrifice, the full merit of which may be difficult to
      appreciate. His queue and his moustache were cut off, and his hair had a
      sprinkling of powder. He had changed his uniform for a goatskin, wore
      hobnailed shoes, a belt full of pistols, and carried a heavy carbine. In
      this costume he was reviewing about two hundred of the natives of
      Fougeres, all in the same kind of dress, which was fitted to deceive the
      eye of the most practised Chouan. The warlike spirit of the little town
      and the Breton character were fully displayed in this scene, which was not
      at all uncommon. Here and there a few mothers and sisters were bringing to
      their sons and brothers gourds filled with brandy, or forgotten pistols.
      Several old men were examining into the number and condition of the
      cartridges of these young national guards dressed in the guise of Chouans,
      whose gaiety was more in keeping with a hunting expedition than the
      dangerous duty they were undertaking. To them, such encounters with
      Chouannerie, where the Breton of the town fought the Breton of the country
      district, had taken the place of the old chivalric tournaments. This
      patriotic enthusiasm may possibly have been connected with certain
      purchases of the &ldquo;national domain.&rdquo; Still, the benefits of the Revolution
      which were better understood and appreciated in the towns, party spirit,
      and a certain national delight in war, had a great deal to do with their
      ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulot, much gratified, was going through the ranks and getting information
      from Gudin, on whom he was now bestowing the confidence and good-will he
      had formerly shown to Merle and Gerard. A number of the inhabitants stood
      about watching the preparations, and comparing the conduct of their
      tumultuous contingent with the regulars of Hulot&rsquo;s brigade. Motionless and
      silent the Blues were awaiting, under control of their officers, the
      orders of the commandant, whose figure they followed with their eyes as he
      passed from rank to rank of the contingent. When Corentin came near the
      old warrior he could not help smiling at the change which had taken place
      in him. He looked like a portrait that has little or no resemblance to the
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; asked Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with us under fire, and you&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; replied Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not a Fougeres man,&rdquo; said Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy to see that, citizen,&rdquo; retorted Gudin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few contemptuous laughs came from the nearest ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Corentin, sharply, &ldquo;that the only way to serve France
      is with bayonets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned his back to the laughers, and asked a woman beside him if
      she knew the object of the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! my good man, the Chouans are at Florigny. They say there are more
      than three thousand, and they are coming to take Fougeres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florigny?&rdquo; cried Corentin, turning white; &ldquo;then the rendezvous is not
      there! Is Florigny on the road to Mayenne?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not two Florignys,&rdquo; replied the woman, pointing in the
      direction of the summit of La Pelerine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going in search of the Marquis de Montauran?&rdquo; said Corentin to
      Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; answered the commandant, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not at Florigny,&rdquo; said Corentin. &ldquo;Send your troops there by all
      means; but keep a few of those imitation Chouans of yours with you, and
      wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is too malignant not to know what he&rsquo;s about,&rdquo; thought Hulot as
      Corentin made off rapidly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the king of spies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot ordered the battalion to start. The republican soldiers marched
      without drums and silently through the narrow suburb which led to the
      Mayenne high-road, forming a blue and red line among the trees and houses.
      The disguised guard followed them; but Hulot, detaining Gudin and about a
      score of the smartest young fellows of the town, remained in the little
      square, awaiting Corentin, whose mysterious manner had piqued his
      curiosity. Francine herself told the astute spy, whose suspicions she
      changed into certainty, of her mistress&rsquo;s departure. Inquiring of the post
      guard at the Porte Saint-Leonard, he learned that Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      had passed that way. Rushing to the Promenade, he was, unfortunately, in
      time to see her movements. Though she was wearing a green dress and hood,
      to be less easily distinguished, the rapidity of her almost distracted
      step enabled him to follow her with his eye through the leafless hedges,
      and to guess the point towards which she was hurrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you said you were going to Florigny, but you are in the
      valley of Gibarry! I am a fool, she has tricked me! No matter, I can light
      my lamp by day as well as by night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin, satisfied that he knew the place of the lovers&rsquo; rendezvous,
      returned in all haste to the little square, which Hulot, resolved not to
      wait any longer, was just quitting to rejoin his troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, general!&rdquo; he cried to the commandant, who turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then told Hulot the events relating to the marquis and Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil, and showed him the scheme of which he held a thread. Hulot,
      struck by his perspicacity, seized him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder! citizen, you are right,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The brigands are
      making a false attack over there to keep the coast clear; but the two
      columns I sent to scour the environs between Antrain and Vitre have not
      yet returned, so we shall have plenty of reinforcements if we need them;
      and I dare say we shall, for the Gars is not such a fool as to risk his
      life without a bodyguard of those damned owls. Gudin,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;go and
      tell Captain Lebrun that he must rub those fellows&rsquo; noses at Florigny
      without me, and come back yourself in a flash. You know the paths. I&rsquo;ll
      wait till you return, and <i>then</i>&mdash;we&rsquo;ll avenge those murders at
      La Vivetiere. Thunder! how he runs,&rdquo; he added, seeing Gudin disappear as
      if by magic. &ldquo;Gerard would have loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his return Gudin found Hulot&rsquo;s little band increased in numbers by the
      arrival of several soldiers taken from the various posts in the town. The
      commandant ordered him to choose a dozen of his compatriots who could best
      counterfeit the Chouans, and take them out by the Porte Saint-Leonard, so
      as to creep round the side of the Saint-Sulpice rocks which overlooks the
      valley of Couesnon and on which was the hovel of Galope-Chopine. Hulot
      himself went out with the rest of his troop by the Porte Saint-Sulpice, to
      reach the summit of the same rocks, where, according to his calculations,
      he ought to meet the men under Beau-Pied, whom he meant to use as a line
      of sentinels from the suburb of Saint-Sulpice to the Nid-aux-Crocs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corentin, satisfied with having delivered over the fate of the Gars to his
      implacable enemies, went with all speed to the Promenade, so as to follow
      with his eyes the military arrangements of the commandant. He soon saw
      Gudin&rsquo;s little squad issuing from the valley of the Nancon and following
      the line of the rocks to the great valley, while Hulot, creeping round the
      castle of Fougeres, was mounting the dangerous path which leads to the
      summit of Saint-Sulpice. The two companies were therefore advancing on
      parallel lines. The trees and shrubs, draped by the rich arabesques of the
      hoarfrost, threw whitish reflections which enabled the watcher to see the
      gray lines of the squads in motion. When Hulot reached the summit of the
      rocks, he detached all the soldiers in uniform from his main body, and
      made them into a line of sentinels, each communicating with the other, the
      first with Gudin, the last with Hulot; so that no shrub could escape the
      bayonets of the three lines which were now in a position to hunt the Gars
      across field and mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sly old wolf!&rdquo; thought Corentin, as the shining muzzle of the last
      gun disappeared in the bushes. &ldquo;The Gars is done for. If Marie had only
      betrayed that damned marquis, she and I would have been united in the
      strongest of all bonds&mdash;a vile deed. But she&rsquo;s mine, in any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twelve young men under Gudin soon reached the base of the rocks of
      Saint-Sulpice. Here Gudin himself left the road with six of them, jumping
      the stiff hedge into the first field of gorse that he came to, while the
      other six by his orders did the same on the other side of the road. Gudin
      advanced to an apple-tree which happened to be in the middle of the field.
      Hearing the rustle of this movement through the gorse, seven or eight men,
      at the head of whom was Beau-Pied, hastily hid behind some chestnut-trees
      which topped the bank of this particular field. Gudin&rsquo;s men did not see
      them, in spite of the white reflections of the hoar-frost and their own
      practised sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! here they are,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied, cautiously putting out his head.
      &ldquo;The brigands have more men than we, but we have &lsquo;em at the muzzles of our
      guns, and we mustn&rsquo;t miss them, or, by the Lord, we are not fit to be
      soldiers of the pope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Gudin&rsquo;s keen eyes had discovered a few muzzles pointing
      through the branches at his little squad. Just then eight voices cried in
      derision, &ldquo;Qui vive?&rdquo; and eight shots followed. The balls whistled round
      Gudin and his men. One fell, another was shot in the arm. The five others
      who were safe and sound replied with a volley and the cry, &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; Then
      they marched rapidly on their assailants so as to reach them before they
      had time to reload.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not know how true we spoke,&rdquo; cried Gudin, as he recognized the
      uniforms and the battered hats of his own brigade. &ldquo;Well, we behaved like
      Bretons, and fought before explaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other men were stupefied on recognizing the little company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil would have known them in those goatskins?&rdquo; cried Beau-Pied,
      dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a misfortune,&rdquo; said Gudin, &ldquo;but we are all innocent if you were not
      informed of the sortie. What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dozen of those Chouans are amusing themselves by picking us off, and we
      are getting away as best we can, like poisoned rats; but by dint of
      scrambling over these hedges and rocks&mdash;may the lightning blast &lsquo;em!&mdash;our
      compasses have got so rusty we are forced to take a rest. I think those
      brigands are now somewhere near the old hovel where you see that smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Gudin. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he added to Beau-Pied and his men, &ldquo;fall back
      towards the rocks through the fields, and join the line of sentinels
      you&rsquo;ll find there. You can&rsquo;t go with us, because you are in uniform. We
      mean to make an end of those curs now; the Gars is with them. I can&rsquo;t stop
      to tell you more. To the right, march! and don&rsquo;t administer any more shots
      to our own goatskins; you&rsquo;ll know ours by their cravats, which they twist
      round their necks and don&rsquo;t tie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gudin left his two wounded men under the apple-tree, and marched towards
      Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s cottage, which Beau-Pied had pointed out to him, the
      smoke from the chimney serving as a guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the young officer was thus closing in upon the Chouans, the little
      detachment under Hulot had reached a point still parallel with that at
      which Gudin had arrived. The old soldier, at the head of his men, was
      silently gliding along the hedges with the ardor of a young man; he jumped
      them from time to time actively enough, casting his wary eyes to the
      heights and listening with the ear of a hunter to every noise. In the
      third field to which he came he found a woman about thirty years old, with
      bent back, hoeing the ground vigorously, while a small boy with a sickle
      in his hand was knocking the hoarfrost from the rushes, which he cut and
      laid in a heap. At the noise Hulot made in jumping the hedge, the boy and
      his mother raised their heads. Hulot mistook the young woman for an old
      one, naturally enough. Wrinkles, coming long before their time, furrowed
      her face and neck; she was clothed so grotesquely in a worn-out goatskin
      that if it had not been for a dirty yellow petticoat, a distinctive mark
      of sex, Hulot would hardly have known the gender she belonged to; for the
      meshes of her long black hair were twisted up and hidden by a red worsted
      cap. The tatters of the little boy did not cover him, but left his skin
      exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! old woman!&rdquo; called Hulot, in a low voice, approaching her, &ldquo;where is
      the Gars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twenty men who accompanied Hulot now jumped the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! if you want the Gars you&rsquo;ll have to go back the way you came,&rdquo; said
      the woman, with a suspicious glance at the troop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ask you the road to Fougeres, old carcass?&rdquo; said Hulot, roughly.
      &ldquo;By Saint-Anne of Auray, have you seen the Gars go by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; replied the woman, bending over her hoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned garce, do you want to have us eaten up by the Blues who are
      after us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the woman raised her head and gave another look of distrust
      at the troop as she replied, &ldquo;How can the Blues be after you? I have just
      seen eight or ten of them who were going back to Fougeres by the lower
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think she meant to stab us with that nose of hers!&rdquo; cried
      Hulot. &ldquo;Here, look, you old nanny-goat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he showed her in the distance three or four of his sentinels, whose
      hats, guns, and uniforms it was easy to recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to let those fellows cut the throats of men who are sent by
      Marche-a-Terre to protect the Gars?&rdquo; he cried, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, beg pardon,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;but it is so easy to be deceived. What
      parish do you belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Georges,&rdquo; replied two or three of the men, in the Breton patois,
      &ldquo;and we are dying of hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;do you see that smoke down there? that&rsquo;s
      my house. Follow the path to the right, and you will come to the rock
      above it. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll meet my man on the way. Galope-Chopine is sure to
      be on watch to warn the Gars. He is spending the day in our house,&rdquo; she
      said, proudly, &ldquo;as you seem to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my good woman,&rdquo; replied Hulot. &ldquo;Forward, march! God&rsquo;s thunder!
      we&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; he added, speaking to his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment followed its leader at a quick step through the path
      pointed out to them. The wife of Galope-Chopine turned pale as she heard
      the un-Catholic oath of the so-called Chouan. She looked at the gaiters
      and goatskins of his men, then she caught her boy in her arms, and sat
      down on the ground, saying, &ldquo;May the holy Virgin of Auray and the ever
      blessed Saint-Labre have pity upon us! Those men are not ours; their shoes
      have no nails in them. Run down by the lower road and warn your father;
      you may save his head,&rdquo; she said to the boy, who disappeared like a deer
      among the bushes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil met no one on her way, neither Blues nor Chouans.
      Seeing the column of blue smoke which was rising from the half-ruined
      chimney of Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s melancholy dwelling, her heart was seized with
      a violent palpitation, the rapid, sonorous beating of which rose to her
      throat in waves. She stopped, rested her hand against a tree, and watched
      the smoke which was serving as a beacon to the foes as well as to the
      friends of the young chieftain. Never had she felt such overwhelming
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I love him too much,&rdquo; she said, with a sort of despair. &ldquo;To-day,
      perhaps, I shall no longer be mistress of myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried over the distance which separated her from the cottage, and
      reached the courtyard, the filth of which was now stiffened by the frost.
      The big dog sprang up barking, but a word from Galope-Chopine silenced him
      and he wagged his tail. As she entered the house Marie gave a look which
      included everything. The marquis was not there. She breathed more freely,
      and saw with pleasure that the Chouan had taken some pains to clean the
      dirty and only room in his hovel. He now took his duck-gun, bowed silently
      to his guest and left the house, followed by his dog. Marie went to the
      threshold of the door and watched him as he took the path to the right of
      his hut. From there she could overlook a series of fields, the curious
      openings to which formed a perspective of gates; for the leafless trees
      and hedges were no longer a barrier to a full view of the country. When
      the Chouan&rsquo;s broad hat was out of sight Mademoiselle de Verneuil turned
      round to look for the church at Fougeres, but the shed concealed it. She
      cast her eyes over the valley of the Couesnon, which lay before her like a
      vast sheet of muslin, the whiteness of which still further dulled a gray
      sky laden with snow. It was one of those days when nature seems dumb and
      noises are absorbed by the atmosphere. Therefore, though the Blues and
      their contingent were marching through the country in three lines, forming
      a triangle which drew together as they neared the cottage, the silence was
      so profound that Mademoiselle de Verneuil was overcome by a presentiment
      which added a sort of physical pain to her mental torture. Misfortune was
      in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in a spot where a little curtain of wood closed the perspective
      of gates, she saw a young man jumping the barriers like a squirrel and
      running with astonishing rapidity. &ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gars was dressed as a Chouan, with a musket slung from his shoulder
      over his goatskin, and would have been quite disguised were it not for the
      grace of his movements. Marie withdrew hastily into the cottage, obeying
      one of those instinctive promptings which are as little explicable as fear
      itself. The young man was soon beside her before the chimney, where a
      bright fire was burning. Both were voiceless, fearing to look at each
      other, or even to make a movement. One and the same hope united them, the
      same doubt; it was agony, it was joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil at last, in a trembling voice,
      &ldquo;your safety alone has brought me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My safety!&rdquo; he said, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;so long as I stay at Fougeres your life is
      threatened, and I love you too well not to leave it. I go to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me! ah, dear love, I shall follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me!&mdash;the Blues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Marie, what have the Blues got to do with our love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seems impossible that you can stay with me in France, and still
      more impossible that you should leave it with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything impossible to those who love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, true! true! all is possible&mdash;have I not the courage to resign
      you, for your sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you could give yourself to a hateful being whom you did not love,
      and you refuse to make the happiness of a man who adores you, whose life
      you fill, who swears to be yours, and yours only. Hear me, Marie, do you
      love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the infamous career of a lost woman; I return to it, I leave
      you&mdash;yes, that I may not bring upon your head the contempt that falls
      on mine. Without that fear, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I fear nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be sure of that? I am distrustful. Who could be otherwise in a
      position like mine? If the love we inspire cannot last at least it should
      be complete, and help us to bear with joy the injustice of the world. But
      you, what have you done for me? You desire me. Do you think that lifts you
      above other men? Suppose I bade you renounce your ideas, your hopes, your
      king (who will, perhaps, laugh when he hears you have died for him, while
      I would die for you with sacred joy!); or suppose I should ask you to send
      your submission to the First Consul so that you could follow me to Paris,
      or go with me to America,&mdash;away from the world where all is vanity;
      suppose I thus tested you, to know if you loved me for myself as at this
      moment I love you? To say all in a word, if I wished, instead of rising to
      your level, that you should fall to mine, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Marie, be silent, do not slander yourself,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Poor child,
      I comprehend you. If my first desire was passion, my passion now is love.
      Dear soul of my soul, you are as noble as your name, I know it,&mdash;as
      great as you are beautiful. I am noble enough, I feel myself great enough
      to force the world to receive you. Is it because I foresee in you the
      source of endless, incessant pleasure, or because I find in your soul
      those precious qualities which make a man forever love the one woman? I do
      not know the cause, but this I know&mdash;that my love for you is
      boundless. I know I can no longer live without you. Yes, life would be
      unbearable unless you are ever with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Marie, will you not understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think to flatter me by the offer of your hand and name,&rdquo; she said,
      with apparent haughtiness, but looking fixedly at the marquis as if to
      detect his inmost thought. &ldquo;How do you know you would love me six months
      hence? and then what would be my fate? No, a mistress is the only woman
      who is sure of a man&rsquo;s heart; duty, law, society, the interests of
      children, are poor auxiliaries. If her power lasts it gives her joys and
      flatteries which make the trials of life endurable. But to be your wife
      and become a drag upon you,&mdash;rather than that, I prefer a passing
      love and a true one, though death and misery be its end. Yes, I could be a
      virtuous mother, a devoted wife; but to keep those instincts firmly in a
      woman&rsquo;s soul the man must not marry her in a rush of passion. Besides, how
      do I know that you will please me to-morrow? No, I will not bring evil
      upon you; I leave Brittany,&rdquo; she said, observing hesitation in his eyes.
      &ldquo;I return to Fougeres now, where you cannot come to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can! and if to-morrow you see smoke on the rocks of Saint-Sulpice you
      will know that I shall be with you at night, your lover, your husband,&mdash;what
      you will that I be to you; I brave all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Alphonse, you love me well,&rdquo; she said, passionately, &ldquo;to risk your
      life before you give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer; he looked at her and her eyes fell; but he read in her
      ardent face a passion equal to his own, and he held out his arms to her. A
      sort of madness overcame her, and she let herself fall softly on his
      breast, resolved to yield to him, and turn this yielding to great results,&mdash;staking
      upon it her future happiness, which would become more certain if she came
      victorious from this crucial test. But her head had scarcely touched her
      lover&rsquo;s shoulder when a slight noise was heard without. She tore herself
      from his arms as if suddenly awakened, and sprang from the cottage. Her
      coolness came back to her, and she thought of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have accepted me and scorned me,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;Ah! if I could
      think that, I would kill him. But not yet!&rdquo; she added, catching sight of
      Beau-Pied, to whom she made a sign which the soldier was quick to
      understand. He turned on his heel, pretending to have seen nothing.
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil re-entered the cottage, putting her finger to her
      lips to enjoin silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are there!&rdquo; she whispered in a frightened voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! must I die without one kiss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her to him, cold and unresisting, and gathered from her lips a
      kiss of horror and of joy, for while it was the first, it might also be
      the last. Then they went together to the door and looked cautiously out.
      The marquis saw Gudin and his men holding the paths leading to the valley.
      Then he turned to the line of gates where the first rotten trunk was
      guarded by five men. Without an instant&rsquo;s pause he jumped on the barrel of
      cider and struck a hole through the thatch of the roof, from which to
      spring upon the rocks behind the house; but he drew his head hastily back
      through the gap he had made, for Hulot was on the height; his retreat was
      cut off in that direction. The marquis turned and looked at his mistress,
      who uttered a cry of despair; for she heard the tramp of the three
      detachments near the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out first,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you shall save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words, to her all-glorious, she went out and stood before the
      door. The marquis loaded his musket. Measuring with his eye the space
      between the door of the hut and the old rotten trunk where seven men
      stood, the Gars fired into their midst and sprang forward instantly,
      forcing a passage through them. The three troops rushed towards the
      opening through which he had passed, and saw him running across the field
      with incredible celerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire! fire! a thousand devils! You&rsquo;re not Frenchmen! Fire, I say!&rdquo; called
      Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he shouted these words from the height above, his men and Gudin&rsquo;s fired
      a volley, which was fortunately ill-aimed. The marquis reached the gate of
      the next field, but as he did so he was almost caught by Gudin, who was
      close upon his heels. The Gars redoubled his speed. Nevertheless, he and
      his pursuer reached the next barrier together; but the marquis dashed his
      musket at Gudin&rsquo;s head with so good an aim that he stopped his rush. It is
      impossible to depict the anxiety betrayed by Marie, or the interest of
      Hulot and his troops as they watched the scene. They all, unconsciously or
      silently, repeated the gestures which they saw the runners making. The
      Gars and Gudin reached the little wood together, but as they did so the
      latter stopped and darted behind a tree. About twenty Chouans, afraid to
      fire at a distance lest they should kill their leader, rushed from the
      copse and riddled the tree with balls. Hulot&rsquo;s men advanced at a run to
      save Gudin, who, being without arms, retreated from tree to tree, seizing
      his opportunity as the Chouans reloaded. His danger was soon over. Hulot
      and the Blues met him at the spot where the marquis had thrown his musket.
      At this instant Gudin perceived his adversary sitting among the trees and
      out of breath, and he left his comrades firing at the Chouans, who had
      retreated behind a lateral hedge; slipping round them, he darted towards
      the marquis with the agility of a wild animal. Observing this manoeuvre
      the Chouans set up a cry to warn their leader; then, having fired on the
      Blues and their contingent with the gusto of poachers, they boldly made a
      rush for them; but Hulot&rsquo;s men sprang through the hedge which served them
      as a rampart and took a bloody revenge. The Chouans then gained the road
      which skirted the fields and took to the heights which Hulot had committed
      the blunder of abandoning. Before the Blues had time to reform, the
      Chouans were entrenched behind the rocks, where they could fire with
      impunity on the Republicans if the latter made any attempt to dislodge
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hulot and his soldiers went slowly towards the little wood to meet
      Gudin, the men from Fougeres busied themselves in rifling the dead Chouans
      and dispatching those who still lived. In this fearful war neither party
      took prisoners. The marquis having made good his escape, the Chouans and
      the Blues mutually recognized their respective positions and the
      uselessness of continuing the fight; so that both sides prepared to
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried one of the Fougeres men, busy about the bodies, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
      bird with yellow wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he showed his companions a purse full of gold which he had just found
      in the pocket of a stout man dressed in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said another, pulling a breviary from the dead man&rsquo;s coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Communion bread&mdash;he&rsquo;s a priest!&rdquo; cried the first man, flinging the
      breviary on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a wretch!&rdquo; cried a third, finding only two crowns in the pockets
      of the body he was stripping, &ldquo;a cheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s got a fine pair of shoes!&rdquo; said a soldier, beginning to pull
      them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have them unless they fall to your share,&rdquo; said the Fougeres
      man, dragging the dead feet away and flinging the boots on a heap of
      clothing already collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Chouan took charge of the money, so that lots might be drawn as
      soon as the troops were all assembled. When Hulot returned with Gudin,
      whose last attempt to overtake the Gars was useless as well as perilous,
      he found about a score of his own men and thirty of the contingent
      standing around eleven of the enemy, whose naked bodies were thrown into a
      ditch at the foot of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soldiers!&rdquo; cried Hulot, sternly. &ldquo;I forbid you to share that clothing.
      Form in line, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; said a soldier, pointing to his shoes, at the points of
      which five bare toes could be seen on each foot, &ldquo;all right about the
      money, but those boots,&rdquo; motioning to a pair of hobnailed boots with the
      butt of his gun, &ldquo;would fit me like a glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to put English shoes on your feet?&rdquo; retorted Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said one of the Fougeres men, respectfully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve divided the
      booty all through the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t prevent you civilians from following your own ways,&rdquo; replied
      Hulot, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Gudin, here&rsquo;s a purse with three louis,&rdquo; said the officer who was
      distributing the money. &ldquo;You have run hard and the commandant won&rsquo;t
      prevent your taking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot looked askance at Gudin, and saw that he turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my uncle&rsquo;s purse!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted as he was with his run, he sprang to the mound of bodies, and
      the first that met his eyes was that of his uncle. But he had hardly
      recognized the rubicund face now furrowed with blue lines, and seen the
      stiffened arms and the gunshot wound before he gave a stifled cry,
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Let us be off, commandant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Blues started. Hulot gave his arm to his young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Never mind, it is no great matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is dead,&rdquo; said Gudin, &ldquo;dead! He was my only relation, and though
      he cursed me, still he loved me. If the king returns, the neighborhood
      will want my head, and my poor uncle would have saved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool Gudin is,&rdquo; said one of the men who had stayed behind to share
      the spoils; &ldquo;his uncle was rich, and he hasn&rsquo;t had time to make a will and
      disinherit him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The division over, the men of Fougeres rejoined the little battalion of
      the Blues on their way to the town.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Towards midnight the cottage of Galope-Chopine, hitherto the scene of life
      without a care, was full of dread and horrible anxiety. Barbette and her
      little boy returned at the supper-hour, one with her heavy burden of
      rushes, the other carrying fodder for the cattle. Entering the hut, they
      looked about in vain for Galope-Chopine; the miserable chamber never
      looked to them as large, so empty was it. The fire was out, and the
      darkness, the silence, seemed to tell of some disaster. Barbette hastened
      to make a blaze, and to light two <i>oribus</i>, the name given to candles
      made of pitch in the region between the villages of Amorique and the Upper
      Loire, and still used beyond Amboise in the Vendomois districts. Barbette
      did these things with the slowness of a person absorbed in one
      overpowering feeling. She listened to every sound. Deceived by the
      whistling of the wind she went often to the door of the hut, returning
      sadly. She cleaned two beakers, filled them with cider, and placed them on
      the long table. Now and again she looked at her boy, who watched the
      baking of the buckwheat cakes, but did not speak to him. The lad&rsquo;s eyes
      happened to rest on the nails which usually held his father&rsquo;s duck-gun,
      and Barbette trembled as she noticed that the gun was gone. The silence
      was broken only by the lowing of a cow or the splash of the cider as it
      dropped at regular intervals from the bung of the cask. The poor woman
      sighed while she poured into three brown earthenware porringers a sort of
      soup made of milk, biscuit broken into bits, and boiled chestnuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have fought in the field next to the Berandiere,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see,&rdquo; replied his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child ran to the place where the fighting had, as he said, taken
      place. In the moonlight he found the heap of bodies, but his father was
      not among them, and he came back whistling joyously, having picked up
      several five-franc pieces trampled in the mud and overlooked by the
      victors. His mother was sitting on a stool beside the fire, employed in
      spinning flax. He made a negative sign to her, and then, ten o&rsquo;clock
      having struck from the tower of Saint-Leonard, he went to bed, muttering a
      prayer to the holy Virgin of Auray. At dawn, Barbette, who had not closed
      her eyes, gave a cry of joy, as she heard in the distance a sound she knew
      well of hobnailed shoes, and soon after Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s scowling face
      presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to Saint-Labre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to whom I owe a candle, the Gars is
      safe. Don&rsquo;t forget that we now owe three candles to the saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized a beaker of cider and emptied it at a draught without drawing
      breath. When his wife had served his soup and taken his gun and he himself
      was seated on the wooden bench, he said, looking at the fire: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      make out how the Blues got here. The fighting was at Florigny. Who the
      devil could have told them that the Gars was in our house; no one knew it
      but he and the handsome garce and we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbette turned white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They made me believe they were the gars of Saint-Georges,&rdquo; she said,
      trembling, &ldquo;it was I who told them the Gars was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galope-Chopine turned pale himself and dropped his porringer on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent the boy to warn you,&rdquo; said Barbette, frightened, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you meet
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chouan rose and struck his wife so violently that she dropped, pale as
      death, upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cursed woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have killed me!&rdquo; Then seized with
      remorse, he took her in his arms. &ldquo;Barbette!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Barbette!&mdash;Holy
      Virgin, my hand was too heavy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she said, opening her eyes, &ldquo;that Marche-a-Terre will hear
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gars will certainly inquire who betrayed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he tell it to Marche-a-Terre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche were both at Florigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbette breathed a little easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they touch a hair of your head,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rinse their glasses
      with vinegar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I can&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; said Galope-Chopine, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife set another pitcher full of cider before him, but he paid no heed
      to it. Two big tears rolled from the woman&rsquo;s eyes and moistened the deep
      furrows of her withered face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, wife; to-morrow morning you must gather fagots on the rocks
      of Saint-Sulpice, to the right and Saint-Leonard and set fire to them.
      That is a signal agreed upon between the Gars and the old rector of
      Saint-Georges who is to come and say mass for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Gars going to Fougeres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to see his handsome garce. I have been sent here and there all day
      about it. I think he is going to marry her and carry her off; for he told
      me to hire horses and have them ready on the road to Saint-Malo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Galope-Chopine, who was tired out, went to bed for an hour or
      two, at the end of which time he again departed. Later, on the following
      morning, he returned, having carefully fulfilled all the commissions
      entrusted to him by the Gars. Finding that Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche
      had not appeared at the cottage, he relieved the apprehensions of his
      wife, who went off, reassured, to the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, where she
      had collected the night before several piles of fagots, now covered with
      hoarfrost. The boy went with her, carrying fire in a broken wooden shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had his wife and son passed out of sight behind the shed when
      Galope-Chopine heard the noise of men jumping the successive barriers, and
      he could dimly see, through the fog which was growing thicker, the forms
      of two men like moving shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche,&rdquo; he said, mentally; then he
      shuddered. The two Chouans entered the courtyard and showed their gloomy
      faces under the broad-brimmed hats which made them look like the figures
      which engravers introduce into their landscapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Galope-Chopine,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre,&rdquo; replied the other, humbly. &ldquo;Will
      you come in and drink a drop? I&rsquo;ve some cold buckwheat cake and fresh-made
      butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not to be refused, cousin,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans entered the cottage. So far there was nothing alarming for
      the master of the house, who hastened to fill three beakers from his huge
      cask of cider, while Marche-a-Terre and Pille-Miche, sitting on the
      polished benches on each side of the long table, cut the cake and spread
      it with the rich yellow butter from which the milk spurted as the knife
      smoothed it. Galope-Chopine placed the beakers full of frothing cider
      before his guests, and the three Chouans began to eat; but from time to
      time the master of the house cast side-long glances at Marche-a-Terre as
      he drank his cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me your snuff-box,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre to Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having shaken several pinches into the palm of his hand the Breton inhaled
      the tobacco like a man who is making ready for serious business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cold,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, rising to shut the upper half of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daylight, already dim with fog, now entered only through the little
      window, and feebly lighted the room and the two seats; the fire, however,
      gave out a ruddy glow. Galope-Chopine refilled the beakers, but his guests
      refused to drink again, and throwing aside their large hats looked at him
      solemnly. Their gestures and the look they gave him terrified
      Galope-Chopine, who fancied he saw blood in the red woollen caps they
      wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch your axe,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, what do you want it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, cousin, you know very well,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche, pocketing his
      snuff-box which Marche-a-Terre returned to him; &ldquo;you are condemned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans rose together and took their guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Marche-a-Terre, I never said one word about the Gars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you to fetch your axe,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hapless man knocked against the wooden bedstead of his son, and
      several five-franc pieces rolled on the floor. Pille-Miche picked them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! the Blues paid you in new money,&rdquo; cried Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as that&rsquo;s the image of Saint-Labre,&rdquo; said Galope-Chopine, &ldquo;I have
      told nothing. Barbette mistook the Fougeres men for the gars of
      Saint-Georges, and that&rsquo;s the whole of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you tell things to your wife?&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, cousin, we don&rsquo;t want excuses, we want your axe. You are
      condemned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from his companion, Pille-Miche helped Marche-a-Terre to seize
      the victim. Finding himself in their grasp Galope-Chopine lost all power
      and fell on his knees holding up his hands to his slayers in desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, my good friends, my cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what will become of my
      little boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take charge of him,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good comrades,&rdquo; cried the victim, turning livid. &ldquo;I am not fit to die.
      Don&rsquo;t make me go without confession. You have the right to take my life,
      but you&rsquo;ve no right to make me lose a blessed eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, addressing Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans waited a moment in much uncertainty, unable to decide this
      case of conscience. Galope-Chopine listened to the rustling of the wind as
      though he still had hope. Suddenly Pille-Miche took him by the arm into a
      corner of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess your sins to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will tell them to a priest of
      the true Church, and if there is any penance to do I will do it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galope-Chopine obtained some respite by the way in which he confessed his
      sins; but in spite of their number and the circumstances of each crime, he
      came finally to the end of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he said, imploringly, &ldquo;since I am speaking to you as I would to
      my confessor, I do assure you, by the holy name of God, that I have
      nothing to reproach myself with except for having, now and then, buttered
      my bread on both sides; and I call on Saint-Labre, who is there over the
      chimney-piece, to witness that I have never said one word about the Gars.
      No, my good friends, I have not betrayed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, that will do, cousin; you can explain all that to God in
      course of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me say good-bye to Barbette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want us to think you worse than
      you are, behave like a Breton and be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans seized him again and threw him on the bench where he gave
      no other sign of resistance than the instinctive and convulsive motions of
      an animal, uttering a few smothered groans, which ceased when the axe
      fell. The head was off at the first blow. Marche-a-Terre took it by the
      hair, left the room, sought and found a large nail in the rough casing of
      the door, and wound the hair about it; leaving the bloody head, the eyes
      of which he did not even close, to hang there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Chouans then washed their hands, without the least haste, in a pot
      full of water, picked up their hats and guns, and jumped the gate,
      whistling the &ldquo;Ballad of the Captain.&rdquo; Pille-Miche began to sing in a
      hoarse voice as he reached the field the last verses of that rustic song,
      their melody floating on the breeze:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;At the first town
  Her lover dressed her
  All in white satin;

  &ldquo;At the next town
  Her lover dressed her
  In gold and silver.

  &ldquo;So beautiful was she
  They gave her veils
  To wear in the regiment.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The tune became gradually indistinguishable as the Chouans got further
      away; but the silence of the country was so great that several of the
      notes reached Barbette&rsquo;s ear as she neared home, holding her boy by the
      hand. A peasant-woman never listens coldly to that song, so popular is it
      in the West of France, and Barbette began, unconsciously, to sing the
      first verses:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Come, let us go, my girl,
  Let us go to the war;
  Let us go, it is time.

  &ldquo;Brave captain,
  Let it not trouble you,
  But my daughter is not for you.

  &ldquo;You shall not have her on earth,
  You shall not have her at sea,
  Unless by treachery.

  &ldquo;The father took his daughter,
  He unclothed her
  And flung her out to sea.

  &ldquo;The captain, wiser still,
  Into the waves he jumped
  And to the shore he brought her.

  &ldquo;Come, let us go, my girl,
  Let us go to the war;
  Let us go, it is time.

  &ldquo;At the first town
  Her lover dressed her,&rdquo;
   Etc., etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      As Barbette reached this verse of the song, where Pille-Miche had begun
      it, she was entering the courtyard of her home; her tongue suddenly
      stiffened, she stood still, and a great cry, quickly repressed, came from
      her gaping lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, mother?&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk alone,&rdquo; she cried, pulling her hand away and pushing him roughly;
      &ldquo;you have neither father nor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child, who was rubbing his shoulder and weeping, suddenly caught sight
      of the thing on the nail; his childlike face kept the nervous convulsion
      his crying had caused, but he was silent. He opened his eyes wide, and
      gazed at the head of his father with a stupid look which betrayed no
      emotion; then his face, brutalized by ignorance, showed savage curiosity.
      Barbette again took his hand, grasped it violently, and dragged him into
      the house. When Pille-Miche and Marche-a-Terre threw their victim on the
      bench one of his shoes, dropping off, fell on the floor beneath his neck
      and was afterward filled with blood. It was the first thing that met the
      widow&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your shoe,&rdquo; said the mother to her son. &ldquo;Put your foot in that.
      Good. Remember,&rdquo; she cried, in a solemn voice, &ldquo;your father&rsquo;s shoe; never
      put on your own without remembering how the Chouans filled it with his
      blood, and <i>kill the Chouans</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed her head with so convulsive an action that the meshes of her
      black hair fell upon her neck and gave a sinister expression to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call Saint-Labre to witness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I vow you to the Blues.
      You shall be a soldier to avenge your father. Kill, kill the <i>Chouans</i>,
      and do as I do. Ha! they&rsquo;ve taken the head of my man, and I am going to
      give that of the Gars to the Blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang at a bound on the bed, seized a little bag of money from a
      hiding-place, took the hand of the astonished little boy, and dragged him
      after her without giving him time to put on his shoe, and was on her way
      to Fougeres rapidly, without once turning her head to look at the home she
      abandoned. When they reached the summit of the rocks of Saint-Sulpice
      Barbette set fire to the pile of fagots, and the boy helped her to pile on
      the green gorse, damp with hoarfrost, to make the smoke more dense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fire will last longer than your father, longer than I, longer than
      the Gars,&rdquo; said Barbette, in a savage voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the widow of Galope-Chopine and her son with his bloody foot stood
      watching, the one, with a gloomy expression of revenge, the other with
      curiosity, the curling of the smoke, Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s eyes were
      fastened on the same rock, trying, but in vain, to see her lover&rsquo;s signal.
      The fog, which had thickened, buried the whole region under a veil, its
      gray tints obscuring even the outlines of the scenery that was nearest the
      town. She examined with tender anxiety the rocks, the castle, the
      buildings, which loomed like shadows through the mist. Near her window
      several trees stood out against this blue-gray background; the sun gave a
      dull tone as of tarnished silver to the sky; its rays colored the bare
      branches of the trees, where a few last leaves were fluttering, with a
      dingy red. But too many dear and delightful sentiments filled Marie&rsquo;s soul
      to let her notice the ill-omens of a scene so out of harmony with the joys
      she was tasting in advance. For the last two days her ideas had undergone
      a change. The fierce, undisciplined vehemence of her passions had yielded
      under the influence of the equable atmosphere which a true love gives to
      life. The certainty of being loved, sought through so many perils, had
      given birth to a desire to re-enter those social conditions which sanction
      love, and which despair alone had made her leave. To love for a moment
      only now seemed to her a species of weakness. She saw herself lifted from
      the dregs of society, where misfortune had driven her, to the high rank in
      which her father had meant to place her. Her vanity, repressed for a time
      by the cruel alternations of hope and misconception, was awakened and
      showed her all the benefits of a great position. Born in a certain way to
      rank, marriage to a marquis meant, to her mind, living and acting in the
      sphere that belonged to her. Having known the chances and changes of an
      adventurous life, she could appreciate, better than other women, the
      grandeur of the feelings which make the Family. Marriage and motherhood
      with all their cares seemed to her less a task than a rest. She loved the
      calm and virtuous life she saw through the clouds of this last storm as a
      woman weary of virtue may sometimes covet an illicit passion. Virtue was
      to her a new seduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought, leaving the window without seeing the signal on
      the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, &ldquo;I have been too coquettish with him&mdash;but
      I knew he loved me! Francine, it is not a dream; to-night I shall be
      Marquise de Montauran. What have I done to deserve such perfect happiness?
      Oh! I love him, and love alone is love&rsquo;s reward. And yet, I think God
      means to recompense me for taking heart through all my misery; he means me
      to forget my sufferings&mdash;for you know, Francine, I have suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, Marquise de Montauran, you, Marie? Ah! until it is done I
      cannot believe it! Who has told him your true goodness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child! he has more than his handsome eyes to see me with, he has a
      soul. If you had seen him, as I have, in danger! Oh! he knows how to love&mdash;he
      is so brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really love him why do you let him come to Fougeres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had no time to say one word to each other when the Blues surprised us.
      Besides, his coming is a proof of love. Can I ever have proofs enough? And
      now, Francine, do my hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she pulled it down a score of times with motions that seemed electric,
      as though some stormy thoughts were mingling still with the arts of her
      coquetry. As she rolled a curl or smoothed the shining plaits she asked
      herself, with a remnant of distrust, whether the marquis were deceiving
      her; but treachery seemed to her impossible, for did he not expose himself
      to instant vengeance by entering Fougeres? While studying in her mirror
      the effects of a sidelong glance, a smile, a gentle frown, an attitude of
      anger, or of love, or disdain, she was seeking some woman&rsquo;s wile by which
      to probe to the last instant the heart of the young leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Francine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I wish with you that the marriage
      were over. This is the last of my cloudy days&mdash;it is big with death
      or happiness. Oh! that fog is dreadful,&rdquo; she went on, again looking
      towards the heights of Saint-Sulpice, which were still veiled in mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to arrange the silk and muslin curtains which draped the window,
      making them intercept the light and produce in the room a voluptuous
      chiaro-scuro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take away those knick-knacks on the mantelpiece;
      leave only the clock and the two Dresden vases. I&rsquo;ll fill those vases
      myself with the flowers Corentin brought me. Take out the chairs, I want
      only this sofa and a fauteuil. Then sweep the carpet, so as to bring out
      the colors, and put wax candles in the sconces and on the mantel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie looked long and carefully at the old tapestry on the walls. Guided
      by her innate taste she found among the brilliant tints of these hangings
      the shades by which to connect their antique beauty with the furniture and
      accessories of the boudoir, either by the harmony of color or the charm of
      contrast. The same thought guided the arrangement of the flowers with
      which she filled the twisted vases which decorated her chamber. The sofa
      was placed beside the fire. On either side of the bed, which filled the
      space parallel to that of the chimney, she placed on gilded tables tall
      Dresden vases filled with foliage and flowers that were sweetly fragrant.
      She quivered more than once as she arranged the folds of the green damask
      above the bed, and studied the fall of the drapery which concealed it.
      Such preparations have a secret, ineffable happiness about them; they
      cause so many delightful emotions that a woman as she makes them forgets
      her doubts; and Mademoiselle de Verneuil forgot hers. There is in truth a
      religious sentiment in the multiplicity of cares taken for one beloved who
      is not there to see them and reward them, but who will reward them later
      with the approving smile these tender preparations (always so fully
      understood) obtain. Women, as they make them, love in advance; and there
      are few indeed who would not say to themselves, as Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil now thought: &ldquo;To-night I shall be happy!&rdquo; That soft hope lies in
      every fold of silk or muslin; insensibly, the harmony the woman makes
      about her gives an atmosphere of love in which she breathes; to her these
      things are beings, witnesses; she has made them the sharers of her coming
      joy. Every movement, every thought brings that joy within her grasp. But
      presently she expects no longer, she hopes no more, she questions silence;
      the slightest sound is to her an omen; doubt hooks its claws once more
      into her heart; she burns, she trembles, she is grasped by a thought which
      holds her like a physical force; she alternates from triumph to agony, and
      without the hope of coming happiness she could not endure the torture. A
      score of times did Mademoiselle de Verneuil raise the window-curtain,
      hoping to see the smoke rising above the rocks; but the fog only took a
      grayer tone, which her excited imagination turned into a warning. At last
      she let fall the curtain, impatiently resolving not to raise it again. She
      looked gloomily around the charming room to which she had given a soul and
      a voice, asking herself if it were done in vain, and this thought brought
      her back to her preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francine,&rdquo; she said, drawing her into a little dressing-room which
      adjoined her chamber and was lighted through a small round window opening
      on a dark corner of the fortifications where they joined the rock terrace
      of the Promenade, &ldquo;put everything in order. As for the salon, you can
      leave that as it is,&rdquo; she added, with a smile which women reserve for
      their nearest friends, the delicate sentiment of which men seldom
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how sweet you are!&rdquo; exclaimed the little maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lover is our beauty&mdash;foolish women that we are!&rdquo; she replied
      gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine left her lying on the ottoman and went away convinced that,
      whether her mistress were loved or not, she would never betray Montauran.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of what you are telling me, old woman?&rdquo; Hulot was saying to
      Barbette, who had sought him out as soon as she had reached Fougeres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got eyes? Look at the rocks of Saint-Sulpice, there, my good
      man, to the right of Saint-Leonard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin, who was with Hulot, looked towards the summit in the direction
      pointed out by Barbette, and, as the fog was beginning to lift, he could
      see with some distinctness the column of white smoke the woman told of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when is he coming, old woman?&mdash;to-night, or this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; said Barbette, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you betray your own side?&rdquo; said Hulot, quickly, having drawn her
      out of hearing of Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! general, see my boy&rsquo;s foot&mdash;that&rsquo;s washed in the blood of my
      man, whom the Chouans have killed like a calf, to punish him for the few
      words you got out of me the other day when I was working in the fields.
      Take my boy, for you&rsquo;ve deprived him of his father and his mother; make a
      Blue of him, my good man, teach him to kill Chouans. Here, there&rsquo;s two
      hundred crowns,&mdash;keep them for him; if he is careful, they&rsquo;ll last
      him long, for it took his father twelve years to lay them by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hulot looked with amazement at the pale and withered woman, whose eyes
      were dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what will become of you? you had better keep
      the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; she replied, shaking her head sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything in this
      world. You might bolt me into that highest tower over there&rdquo; (pointing to
      the battlements of the castle) &ldquo;and the Chouans would contrive to come and
      kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed her boy with an awful expression of grief, looked at him, wiped
      away her tears, looked at him again, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;this is an occasion when two heads are
      better than one. We know all, and yet we know nothing. If you surrounded
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s house now, you will only warn her. Neither you,
      nor I, nor your Blues and your battalions are strong enough to get the
      better of that girl if she takes it into her head to save the <i>ci-devant</i>.
      The fellow is brave, and consequently wily; he is a young man full of
      daring. We can never get hold of him as he enters Fougeres. Perhaps he is
      here already. Domiciliary visit? Absurdity! that&rsquo;s no good, it will only
      give them warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hulot impatiently, &ldquo;I shall tell the sentry on the Place
      Saint-Leonard to keep his eye on the house, and pass word along the other
      sentinels, if a young man enters it; as soon as the signal reaches me I
      shall take a corporal and four men and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and,&rdquo; said Corentin, interrupting the old soldier, &ldquo;if the young
      man is not the marquis, or if the marquis doesn&rsquo;t go in by the front door,
      or if he is already there, if&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin looked at the commandant with so insulting an air of superiority
      that the old soldier shouted out: &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thousand thunders! get out of
      here, citizen of hell! What have I got to do with your intrigues? If that
      cockchafer buzzes into my guard-room I shall shoot him; if I hear he is in
      a house I shall surround that house and take him when he leaves it and
      shoot him, but may the devil get me if I soil my uniform with any of your
      tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant, the order of the ministers states that you are to obey
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her come and give them to me herself and I&rsquo;ll see about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, citizen,&rdquo; said Corentin, haughtily, &ldquo;she shall come. She shall tell
      you herself the hour at which she expects the <i>ci-devant</i>. Possibly
      she won&rsquo;t be easy till you do post the sentinels round the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil is made man,&rdquo; thought the old leader as he watched Corentin
      hurrying up the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase at the foot of which this scene had
      taken place. &ldquo;He means to deliver Montauran bound hand and foot, with no
      chance to fight for his life, and I shall be harrassed to death with a
      court-martial. However,&rdquo; he added, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;the Gars
      certainly is an enemy of the Republic, and he killed my poor Gerard, and
      his death will make a noble the less&mdash;the devil take him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on the heels of his boots and went off, whistling the
      Marseillaise, to inspect his guard-rooms.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil was absorbed in one of those meditations the
      mysteries of which are buried in the soul, and prove by their thousand
      contradictory emotions, to the woman who undergoes them, that it is
      possible to have a stormy and passionate existence between four walls
      without even moving from the ottoman on which her very life is burning
      itself away. She had reached the final scene of the drama she had come to
      enact, and her mind was going over and over the phases of love and anger
      which had so powerfully stirred her during the ten days which had now
      elapsed since her first meeting with the marquis. A man&rsquo;s step suddenly
      sounded in the adjoining room and she trembled; the door opened, she
      turned quickly and saw Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little cheat!&rdquo; said the police-agent, &ldquo;when will you stop deceiving?
      Ah, Marie, Marie, you are playing a dangerous game by not taking me into
      your confidence. Why do you play such tricks without consulting me? If the
      marquis escapes his fate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be your fault, will it?&rdquo; she replied, sarcastically. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
       she continued, in a grave voice, &ldquo;by what right do you come into my
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your house?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; she answered, coldly, &ldquo;that I have no home. Perhaps you
      chose this house deliberately for the purpose of committing murder. I
      shall leave it. I would live in a desert to get away from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spies, say the word,&rdquo; interrupted Corentin. &ldquo;But this house is neither
      yours nor mine, it belongs to the government; and as for leaving it you
      will do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; he added, giving her a diabolical look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil rose indignantly, made a few steps to leave the
      room, but stopped short suddenly as Corentin raised the curtain of the
      window and beckoned her, with a smile, to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that column of smoke?&rdquo; he asked, with the calmness he always
      kept on his livid face, however intense his feelings might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has my departure to do with that burning brush?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does your voice tremble?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You poor thing!&rdquo; he added, in a
      gentle voice, &ldquo;I know all. The marquis is coming to Fougeres this evening;
      and it is not with any intention of delivering him to us that you have
      arranged this boudoir and the flowers and candles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil turned pale, for she saw her lover&rsquo;s death in the
      eyes of this tiger with a human face, and her love for him rose to frenzy.
      Each hair on her head caused her an acute pain she could not endure, and
      she fell on the ottoman. Corentin stood looking at her for a moment with
      his arms folded, half pleased at inflicting a torture which avenged him
      for the contempt and the sarcasms this woman had heaped upon his head,
      half grieved by the sufferings of a creature whose yoke was pleasant to
      him, heavy as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves him!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loves him!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ah! what are words? Corentin! he is my life, my
      soul, my breath!&rdquo; She flung herself at the feet of the man, whose silence
      terrified her. &ldquo;Soul of vileness!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I would rather degrade
      myself to save his life than degrade myself by betraying him. I will save
      him at the cost of my own blood. Speak, what price must I pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to take your orders, Marie,&rdquo; he said, raising her. &ldquo;Yes, Marie,
      your insults will not hinder my devotion to your wishes, provided you will
      promise not to deceive me again; you must know by this time that no one
      dupes me with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want me to love you, Corentin, help me to save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour is he coming?&rdquo; asked the spy, endeavoring to ask the
      question calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo; thought Mademoiselle de Verneuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is deceiving me!&rdquo; thought Corentin. &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have
      two maxims. One is never to believe a single word a woman says to me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the only means of not being duped; the other is to find what interest she
      has in doing the opposite of what she says, and behaving in contradiction
      to the facts she pretends to confide to me. I think that you and I
      understand each other now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil. &ldquo;You want proofs of my good
      faith; but I reserve them for the time when you give me some of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Corentin, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling; &ldquo;sit down, and pray don&rsquo;t sulk; but if
      you do I shall know how to save the marquis without you. As for the three
      hundred thousand francs which are always spread before your eyes, I will
      give them to you in good gold as soon as the marquis is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin rose, stepped back a pace or two, and looked at Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have grown rich in a very short time,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of
      ill-disguised bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montauran,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;will make you a better offer still for his
      ransom. Now, then, prove to me that you have the means of guaranteeing him
      from all danger and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you send him away the moment he arrives?&rdquo; cried Corentin, suddenly.
      &ldquo;Hulot does not know he is coming, and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped as if he had
      said too much. &ldquo;But how absurd that you should ask me how to play a
      trick,&rdquo; he said, with an easy laugh. &ldquo;Now listen, Marie, I do feel certain
      of your loyalty. Promise me a compensation for all I lose in furthering
      your wishes, and I will make that old fool of a commandant so unsuspicious
      that the marquis will be as safe at Fougeres as at Saint-James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I promise it,&rdquo; said the girl, with a sort of solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not in that way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;swear it by your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil shuddered; raising a trembling hand she made the
      oath required by the man whose tone to her had changed so suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can command me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t deceive me again, and you shall have
      reason to bless me to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will trust you, Corentin,&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Verneuil, much moved.
      She bowed her head gently towards him and smiled with a kindness not
      unmixed with surprise, as she saw an expression of melancholy tenderness
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an enchanting creature!&rdquo; thought Corentin, as he left the house.
      &ldquo;Shall I ever get her as a means to fortune and a source of delight? To
      fling herself at my feet! Oh, yes, the marquis shall die! If I can&rsquo;t get
      that woman in any other way than by dragging her through the mud, I&rsquo;ll
      sink her in it. At any rate,&rdquo; he thought, as he reached the square
      unconscious of his steps, &ldquo;she no longer distrusts me. Three hundred
      thousand francs down! she thinks me grasping! Either the offer was a trick
      or she is already married to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin, buried in thought, was unable to come to a resolution. The fog
      which the sun had dispersed at mid-day was now rolling thicker and
      thicker, so that he could hardly see the trees at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another piece of ill-luck,&rdquo; he muttered, as he turned slowly
      homeward. &ldquo;It is impossible to see ten feet. The weather protects the
      lovers. How is one to watch a house in such a fog? Who goes there?&rdquo; he
      cried, catching the arm of a boy who seemed to have clambered up the
      dangerous rocks which made the terrace of the Promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said a childish voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the boy with the bloody foot. Do you want to revenge your father?&rdquo;
       said Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Do you know the Gars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good again. Now, don&rsquo;t leave me except to do what I bid you, and you will
      obey your mother and earn some big sous&mdash;do you like sous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like sous, and you want to kill the Gars who killed your father&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;ll take care of you. Ah! Marie,&rdquo; he muttered, after a pause, &ldquo;you
      yourself shall betray him, as you engaged to do! She is too violent to
      suspect me&mdash;passion never reflects. She does not know the marquis&rsquo;s
      writing. Yes, I can set a trap into which her nature will drive her
      headlong. But I must first see Hulot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil and Francine were deliberating on the means of
      saving the marquis from the more than doubtful generosity of Corentin and
      Hulot&rsquo;s bayonets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could go and warn him,&rdquo; said the Breton girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know where he is,&rdquo; replied Marie; &ldquo;even I, with the
      instincts of love, could never find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After making and rejecting a number of plans Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      exclaimed, &ldquo;When I see him his danger will inspire me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought, like other ardent souls, to act on the spur of the moment,
      trusting to her star, or to that instinct of adroitness which rarely, if
      ever, fails a woman. Perhaps her heart was never so wrung. At times she
      seemed stupefied, her eyes were fixed, and then, at the least noise, she
      shook like a half-uprooted tree which the woodsman drags with a rope to
      hasten its fall. Suddenly, a loud report from a dozen guns echoed from a
      distance. Marie turned pale and grasped Francine&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I am dying,&rdquo; she
      cried; &ldquo;they have killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy footfall of a man was heard in the antechamber. Francine went
      out and returned with a corporal. The man, making a military salute to
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, produced some letters, the covers of which were
      a good deal soiled. Receiving no acknowledgment, the Blue said as he
      withdrew, &ldquo;Madame, they are from the commandant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil, a prey to horrible presentiments, read a letter
      written apparently in great haste by Hulot:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;a party of my men have just caught a messenger from
  the Gars and have shot him. Among the intercepted letters is one
  which may be useful to you and I transmit it&mdash;etc.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, it was not he they shot,&rdquo; she exclaimed, flinging the letter
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed more freely and took up the other letter, enclosed by Hulot.
      It was apparently written to Madame du Gua by the marquis.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;No, my angel,&rdquo; the letter said, &ldquo;I cannot go to-night to La
  Vivetiere. You must lose your wager with the count. I triumph over
  the Republic in the person of their beautiful emissary. You must
  allow that she is worth the sacrifice of one night. It will be my
  only victory in this campaign, for I have received the news that
  La Vendee surrenders. I can do nothing more in France. Let us go
  back to England&mdash;but we will talk of all this to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The letter fell from Marie&rsquo;s hands; she closed her eyes, and was silent,
      leaning backward, with her head on a cushion. After a long pause she
      looked at the clock, which then marked four in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord keeps me waiting,&rdquo; she said, with savage irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! God grant he may not come!&rdquo; cried Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not come,&rdquo; said Marie, in a stifled tone, &ldquo;I shall go to him.
      No, no, he will soon be here. Francine, do I look well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very pale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; continued Mademoiselle de Verneuil, glancing about her, &ldquo;this
      perfumed room, the flowers, the lights, this intoxicating air, it is full
      of that celestial life of which I dreamed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am betrayed, deceived, insulted, fooled! I will kill him, I will tear
      him bit by bit! Yes, there was always in his manner a contempt he could
      not hide and which I would not see. Oh! I shall die of this! Fool that I
      am,&rdquo; she went on laughing, &ldquo;he is coming; I have one night in which to
      teach him that, married or not, the man who has possessed me cannot
      abandon me. I will measure my vengeance by his offence; he shall die with
      despair in his soul. I did believe he had a soul of honor, but no! it is
      that of a lackey. Ah, he has cleverly deceived me, for even now it seems
      impossible that the man who abandoned me to Pille-Miche should sink to
      such back-stair tricks. It is so base to deceive a loving woman, for it is
      so easy. He might have killed me if he chose, but lie to me! to me, who
      held him in my thoughts so high! The scaffold! the scaffold! ah! could I
      only see him guillotined! Am I cruel? He shall go to his death covered
      with caresses, with kisses which might have blessed him for a lifetime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said Francine, gently, &ldquo;be the victim of your lover like other
      women; not his mistress and his betrayer. Keep his memory in your heart;
      do not make it an anguish to you. If there were no joys in hopeless love,
      what would become of us, poor women that we are? God, of whom you never
      think, Marie, will reward us for obeying our vocation on this earth,&mdash;to
      love, and suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle de Verneuil, taking Francine&rsquo;s hand and
      patting it, &ldquo;your voice is very sweet and persuasive. Reason is attractive
      from your lips. I should like to obey you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive him, you will not betray him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! never speak of that man again. Compared with him Corentin is a
      noble being. Do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, hiding beneath a face that was horribly calm the madness of her
      soul and a thirst for vengeance. The slow and measured step with which she
      left the room conveyed the sense of an irrevocable resolution. Lost in
      thought, hugging her insults, too proud to show the slightest suffering,
      she went to the guard-room at the Porte Saint-Leonard and asked where the
      commandant lived. She had hardly left her house when Corentin entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Monsieur Corentin,&rdquo; cried Francine, &ldquo;if you are interested in this
      young man, save him; Mademoiselle has gone to give him up because of this
      wretched letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin took the letter carelessly and asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will save her from her own despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared, taking the letter with him. When he reached the street he
      said to Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s boy, whom he had stationed to watch the door,
      &ldquo;Which way did a lady go who left the house just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy went with him a little way and showed him the steep street which
      led to the Porte Saint-Leonard. &ldquo;That way,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment four men entered Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s house, unseen
      by either the boy or Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to your watch,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;Play with the handles of the
      blinds and see what you can inside; look about you everywhere, even on the
      roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin darted rapidly in the direction given him, and thought he
      recognized Mademoiselle de Verneuil through the fog; he did, in fact,
      overtake her just as she reached the guard-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are pale&mdash;what has happened? Is
      it right for you to be out alone? Take my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the commandant?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the words left her lips when she heard the movement of troops
      beyond the Porte Saint-Leonard and distinguished Hulot&rsquo;s gruff voice in
      the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s thunder!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I never saw such fog as this for a
      reconnaissance! The Gars must have ordered the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you complaining of?&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, grasping his
      arm. &ldquo;The fog will cover vengeance as well as perfidy. Commandant,&rdquo; she
      added, in a low voice, &ldquo;you must take measures at once so that the Gars
      may not escape us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at your house?&rdquo; he asked, in a tone which showed his amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but give me a safe man and I will send him to you
      when the marquis comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;a soldier will alarm him, but a boy,
      and I can find one, will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Verneuil, &ldquo;thanks to this fog which you
      are cursing, you can surround my house. Put soldiers everywhere. Place a
      guard in the church to command the esplanade on which the windows of my
      salon open. Post men on the Promenade; for though the windows of my
      bedroom are twenty feet above the ground, despair does sometimes give a
      man the power to jump even greater distances safely. Listen to what I say.
      I shall probably send this gentleman out of the door of my house;
      therefore see that only brave men are there to meet him; for,&rdquo; she added,
      with a sigh, &ldquo;no one denies him courage; he will assuredly defend
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gudin!&rdquo; called the commandant. &ldquo;Listen, my lad,&rdquo; he continued in a low
      voice when the young man joined him, &ldquo;this devil of a girl is betraying
      the Gars to us&mdash;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know why, but that&rsquo;s no matter.
      Take ten men and place yourself so as to hold the cul-de-sac in which the
      house stands; be careful that no one sees either you or your men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, commandant, I know the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Hulot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Beau-Pied to let you know when to play
      your sabres. Try to meet the marquis yourself, and if you can manage to
      kill him, so that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have to shoot him judicially, you shall be a
      lieutenant in a fortnight or my name&rsquo;s not Hulot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gudin departed with a dozen soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you have done?&rdquo; said Corentin to Mademoiselle de
      Verneuil, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but looked with a sort of satisfaction at the men who
      were starting, under command of the sub-lieutenant, for the Promenade,
      while others, following the next orders given by Hulot, were to post
      themselves in the shadows of the church of Saint-Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are houses adjoining mine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you had better surround them
      all. Don&rsquo;t lay up regrets by neglecting a single precaution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mad,&rdquo; thought Hulot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not a prophet?&rdquo; asked Corentin in his ear. &ldquo;As for the boy I shall
      send with her, he is the little gars with a bloody foot; therefore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish his sentence, for Mademoiselle de Verneuil by a sudden
      movement darted in the direction of her house, whither he followed her,
      whistling like a man supremely satisfied. When he overtook her she was
      already at the door of her house, where Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s little boy was on
      the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;take the lad with you; you cannot have a
      more innocent or active emissary. Boy,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;when you have seen the
      Gars enter the house come to me, no matter who stops you; you&rsquo;ll find me
      at the guard-house and I&rsquo;ll give you something that will make you eat cake
      for the rest of your days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, breathed rather than said in the child&rsquo;s ear, Corentin
      felt his hand squeezed by that of the little Breton, who followed
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my good friends, you can come to an explanation as soon as you
      like,&rdquo; cried Corentin when the door was closed. &ldquo;If you make love, my
      little marquis, it will be on your winding-sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Corentin could not bring himself to let that fatal house completely
      out of sight, and he went to the Promenade, where he found the commandant
      giving his last orders. By this time it was night. Two hours went by; but
      the sentinels posted at intervals noticed nothing that led them to suppose
      the marquis had evaded the triple line of men who surrounded the three
      sides by which the tower of Papegaut was accessible. Twenty times had
      Corentin gone from the Promenade to the guard-room, always to find that
      his little emissary had not appeared. Sunk in thought, the spy paced the
      Promenade slowly, enduring the martyrdom to which three passions, terrible
      in their clashing, subject a man,&mdash;love, avarice, and ambition. Eight
      o&rsquo;clock struck from all the towers in the town. The moon rose late. Fog
      and darkness wrapped in impenetrable gloom the places where the drama
      planned by this man was coming to its climax. He was able to silence the
      struggle of his passions as he walked up and down, his arms crossed, and
      his eyes fixed on the windows which rose like the luminous eyes of a
      phantom above the rampart. The deep silence was broken only by the
      rippling of the Nancon, by the regular and lugubrious tolling from the
      belfries, by the heavy steps of the sentinels or the rattle of arms as the
      guard was hourly relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night&rsquo;s as thick as a wolf&rsquo;s jaw,&rdquo; said the voice of Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; growled Marche-a-Terre, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t talk more than a dead dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hardly breathing,&rdquo; said the Chouan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the man who made that stone roll down wants his heart to serve as the
      scabbard for my knife he&rsquo;ll do it again,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre, in a low
      voice scarcely heard above the flowing of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, old money-bag, down on your stomach,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and
      wriggle like a snake through a hedge, or we shall leave our carcasses
      behind us sooner than we need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Marche-a-Terre,&rdquo; said the incorrigible Pille-Miche, who was using
      his hands to drag himself along on his stomach, and had reached the level
      of his comrade&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;If the Grande-Garce is to be believed there&rsquo;ll be a
      fine booty to-day. Will you go shares with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pille-Miche,&rdquo; said Marche-a-Terre stopping short on the flat
      of his stomach. The other Chouans, who were accompanying the two men, did
      the same, so wearied were they with the difficulties they had met with in
      climbing the precipice. &ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; continued Marche-a-Terre, &ldquo;for a
      Jack Grab-All who would rather give blows than receive them when there&rsquo;s
      nothing else to be done. We have not come here to grab dead men&rsquo;s shoes;
      we are devils against devils, and sorrow to those whose claws are too
      short. The Grande-Garce has sent us here to save the Gars. He is up there;
      lift your dog&rsquo;s nose and see that window above the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Midnight was striking. The moon rose, giving the appearance of white smoke
      to the fog. Pille-Miche squeezed Marche-a-Terre&rsquo;s arm and silently showed
      him on the terrace just above them, the triangular iron of several shining
      bayonets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Blues are there already,&rdquo; said Pille-Miche; &ldquo;we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t gain anything
      by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; replied Marche-a-Terre; &ldquo;if I examined right this morning, we
      must be at the foot of the Papegaut tower between the ramparts and the
      Promenade,&mdash;that place where they put the manure; it is like a
      feather-bed to fall on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Saint-Labre,&rdquo; remarked Pille-Miche, &ldquo;would only change into cider the
      blood we shall shed to-night the citizens might lay in a good stock
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marche-a-Terre laid his large hand over his friend&rsquo;s mouth; then an order
      muttered by him went from rank to rank of the Chouans suspended as they
      were in mid-air among the brambles of the slate rocks. Corentin, walking
      up and down the esplanade had too practiced an ear not to hear the
      rustling of the shrubs and the light sound of pebbles rolling down the
      sides of the precipice. Marche-a-Terre, who seemed to possess the gift of
      seeing in darkness, and whose senses, continually in action, were acute as
      those of a savage, saw Corentin; like a trained dog he had scented him.
      Fouche&rsquo;s diplomatist listened but heard nothing; he looked at the natural
      wall of rock and saw no signs. If the confusing gleam of the fog enabled
      him to see, here and there, a crouching Chouan, he took him, no doubt, for
      a fragment of rock, for these human bodies had all the appearance of inert
      nature. This danger to the invaders was of short duration. Corentin&rsquo;s
      attention was diverted by a very distinct noise coming from the other end
      of the Promenade, where the rock wall ended and a steep descent leading
      down to the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase began. When Corentin reached the spot he saw
      a figure gliding past it as if by magic. Putting out his hand to grasp
      this real or fantastic being, who was there, he supposed, with no good
      intentions, he encountered the soft and rounded figure of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if any one else had met you, you&rsquo;d
      have had a ball through your head. What are you doing, and where are you
      going, at this time of night? Are you dumb? It certainly is a woman,&rdquo; he
      said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was suspicious, but the stranger broke it by saying, in a
      voice which suggested extreme fright, &ldquo;Ah, my good man, I&rsquo;m on my way back
      from a wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the pretended mother of the marquis,&rdquo; thought Corentin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
      what she&rsquo;s about. Well, go that way, old woman,&rdquo; he replied, feigning not
      to recognize her. &ldquo;Keep to the left if you don&rsquo;t want to be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood quite still; then observing that Madame du Gua was making for the
      Papegaut tower, he followed her at a distance with diabolical caution.
      During this fatal encounter the Chouans had posted themselves on the
      manure towards which Marche-a-Terre had guided them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Grande-Garce!&rdquo; thought Marche-a-Terre, as he rose to his feet
      against the tower wall like a bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; he said to her in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a ladder in the garden of that house about
      six feet above the manure; find it, and the Gars is saved. Do you see that
      small window up there? It is in the dressing-room; you must get to it.
      This side of the tower is the only one not watched. The horses are ready;
      if you can hold the passage over the Nancon, a quarter of an hour will put
      him out of danger&mdash;in spite of his folly. But if that woman tries to
      follow him, stab her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin now saw several of the forms he had hitherto supposed to be
      stones moving cautiously but swiftly. He went at once to the guard-room at
      the Porte Saint-Leonard, where he found the commandant fully dressed and
      sound asleep on a camp bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied, roughly, &ldquo;he has only just lain down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chouans are here!&rdquo; cried Corentin, in Hulot&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! but so much the better,&rdquo; cried the old soldier, still half
      asleep; &ldquo;then he can fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Hulot reached the Promenade Corentin pointed out to him the singular
      position taken by the Chouans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have deceived or strangled the sentries I placed between the
      castle and the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase. Ah! what a devil of a fog! However,
      patience! I&rsquo;ll send a squad of men under a lieutenant to the foot of the
      rock. There is no use attacking them where they are, for those animals are
      so hard they&rsquo;d let themselves roll down the precipice without breaking a
      limb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cracked clock of the belfry was ringing two when the commandant got
      back to the Promenade after giving these orders and taking every military
      precaution to seize the Chouans. The sentries were doubled and
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil&rsquo;s house became the centre of a little army. Hulot
      found Corentin absorbed in contemplation of the window which overlooked
      the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; said the commandant, &ldquo;I think the <i>ci-devant</i> has fooled
      us; there&rsquo;s nothing stirring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there,&rdquo; cried Corentin, pointing to the window. &ldquo;I have seen a
      man&rsquo;s shadow on the curtain. But I can&rsquo;t think what has become of that
      boy. They must have killed him or locked him up. There! commandant, don&rsquo;t
      you see that? there&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s shadow; come, come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seize him in bed; thunder of God! He will come out if he went
      in; Gudin won&rsquo;t miss him,&rdquo; cried Hulot, who had his own reasons for
      waiting till the Gars could defend himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant, I enjoin you, in the name of the law to proceed at once into
      that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine scoundrel to try to make me do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without showing any resentment at the commandant&rsquo;s language, Corentin said
      coolly: &ldquo;You will obey me. Here is an order in good form, signed by the
      minister of war, which will force you to do so.&rdquo; He drew a paper from his
      pocket and held it out. &ldquo;Do you suppose we are such fools as to leave that
      girl to do as she likes? We are endeavoring to suppress a civil war, and
      the grandeur of the purpose covers the pettiness of the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take the liberty, citizen, of sending you to&mdash;you understand me?
      Enough. To the right-about, march! Let me alone, or it will be the worse
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But read that,&rdquo; persisted Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me with your functions,&rdquo; cried Hulot, furious at receiving
      orders from a man he regarded as contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Galope-Chopine&rsquo;s boy suddenly appeared among them like a
      rat from a hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gars has started!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rue Saint-Leonard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beau-Pied,&rdquo; said Hulot in a whisper to the corporal who was near him, &ldquo;go
      and tell your lieutenant to draw in closer round the house, and make ready
      to fire. Left wheel, forward on the tower, the rest of you!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the conclusion of this fatal drama we must re-enter the
      house with Mademoiselle de Verneuil when she returned to it after
      denouncing the marquis to the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When passions reach their crisis they bring us under the dominion of far
      greater intoxication than the petty excitements of wine or opium. The
      lucidity then given to ideas, the delicacy of the high-wrought senses,
      produce the most singular and unexpected effects. Some persons when they
      find themselves under the tyranny of a single thought can see with
      extraordinary distinctness objects scarcely visible to others, while at
      the same time the most palpable things become to them almost as if they
      did not exist. When Mademoiselle de Verneuil hurried, after reading the
      marquis&rsquo;s letter, to prepare the way for vengeance just as she had lately
      been preparing all for love, she was in that stage of mental intoxication
      which makes real life like the life of a somnambulist. But when she saw
      her house surrounded, by her own orders, with a triple line of bayonets a
      sudden flash of light illuminated her soul. She judged her conduct and saw
      with horror that she had committed a crime. Under the first shock of this
      conviction she sprang to the threshold of the door and stood there
      irresolute, striving to think, yet unable to follow out her reasoning. She
      knew so vaguely what had happened that she tried in vain to remember why
      she was in the antechamber, and why she was leading a strange child by the
      hand. A million of stars were floating in the air before her like tongues
      of fire. She began to walk about, striving to shake off the horrible
      torpor which laid hold of her; but, like one asleep, no object appeared to
      her under its natural form or in its own colors. She grasped the hand of
      the little boy with a violence not natural to her, dragging him along with
      such precipitate steps that she seemed to have the motions of a madwoman.
      She saw neither persons nor things in the salon as she crossed it, and yet
      she was saluted by three men who made way to let her pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be she,&rdquo; said one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very handsome,&rdquo; exclaimed another, who was a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the first; &ldquo;but how pale and agitated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And beside herself,&rdquo; said the third; &ldquo;she did not even see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door of her own room Mademoiselle de Verneuil saw the smiling face
      of Francine, who whispered to her: &ldquo;He is here, Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil awoke, reflected, looked at the child whose hand
      she held, remembered all, and replied to the girl: &ldquo;Shut up that boy; if
      you wish me to live do not let him escape you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she slowly said the words her eyes were fixed on the door of her
      bedroom, and there they continued fastened with so dreadful a fixedness
      that it seemed as if she saw her victim through the wooden panels. Then
      she gently opened it, passed through and closed it behind her without
      turning round, for she saw the marquis standing before the fireplace. His
      dress, without being too choice, had the look of careful arrangement which
      adds so much to the admiration which a woman feels for her lover. All her
      self-possession came back to her at the sight of him. Her lips, rigid,
      although half-open, showed the enamel of her white teeth and formed a
      smile that was fixed and terrible rather than voluptuous. She walked with
      slow steps toward the young man and pointed with her finger to the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who is worthy of love is worth waiting for,&rdquo; she said with
      deceptive gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, overcome with the violence of her emotions, she dropped upon the
      sofa which was near the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Marie, you are so charming when you are angry,&rdquo; said the marquis,
      sitting down beside her and taking her hand, which she let him take, and
      entreating a look, which she refused him. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he continued, in a
      tender, caressing voice, &ldquo;that my wife will not long refuse a glance to
      her loving husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words she turned abruptly and looked into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of that dreadful look?&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;But your
      hand is burning! oh, my love, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love!&rdquo; she repeated, in a dull, changed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, throwing himself on his knees beside her and taking her
      two hands which he covered with kisses. &ldquo;Yes, my love&mdash;I am thine for
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed him violently away from her and rose. Her features contracted,
      she laughed as mad people laugh, and then she said to him: &ldquo;You do not
      mean one word of all you are saying, base man&mdash;baser than the lowest
      villain.&rdquo; She sprang to the dagger which was lying beside a flower-vase,
      and let it sparkle before the eyes of the amazed young marquis. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she
      said, flinging it away from her, &ldquo;I do not respect you enough to kill you.
      Your blood is even too vile to be shed by soldiers; I see nothing fit for
      you but the executioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were painfully uttered in a low voice, and she moved her feet
      like a spoilt child, impatiently. The marquis went to her and tried to
      clasp her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; she cried, recoiling from him with a look of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mad!&rdquo; said the marquis in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad, yes!&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;but not mad enough to be your dupe. What would
      I not forgive to passion? but to seek to possess me without love, and to
      write to that woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom have I written?&rdquo; he said, with an astonishment which was
      certainly not feigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that chaste woman who sought to kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis turned pale with anger and said, grasping the back of a chair
      until he broke it, &ldquo;If Madame du Gua has committed some dastardly wrong&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil looked for the letter; not finding it she called
      to Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that letter?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Corentin took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corentin! ah! I understand it all; he wrote the letter; he has deceived
      me with diabolical art&mdash;as he alone can deceive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a piercing cry she flung herself on the sofa, tears rushing from her
      eyes. Doubt and confidence were equally dreadful now. The marquis knelt
      beside her and clasped her to his breast, saying, again and again, the
      only words he was able to utter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you weep, my darling? there is no harm done; your reproaches were
      all love; do not weep, I love you&mdash;I shall always love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he felt her press him with almost supernatural force. &ldquo;Do you
      still love me?&rdquo; she said, amid her sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you doubt it?&rdquo; he replied in a tone that was almost melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She abruptly disengaged herself from his arms, and fled, as if frightened
      and confused, to a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I doubt it?&rdquo; she exclaimed, but a smile of gentle meaning was on her
      lover&rsquo;s face, and the words died away upon her lips; she let him take her
      by the hand and lead her to the salon. There an altar had been hastily
      arranged during her absence. The priest was robed in his officiating
      vestments. The lighted tapers shed upon the ceiling a glow as soft as hope
      itself. She now recognized the two men who had bowed to her, the Comte de
      Bauvan and the Baron du Guenic, the witnesses chosen by Montauran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not still refuse?&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the sight she stopped, stepped backward into her chamber and fell
      on her knees; raising her hands towards the marquis she cried out:
      &ldquo;Pardon! pardon! pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died away, her head fell back, her eyes closed, and she lay in
      the arms of her lover and Francine as if dead. When she opened her eyes
      they met those of the young man full of loving tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie! patience! this is your last trial,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last!&rdquo; she exclaimed, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine and the marquis looked at each other in surprise, but she
      silenced them by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the priest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and leave me alone with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did so, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she said to the priest so suddenly called to her, &ldquo;in my
      childhood an old man, white-haired like yourself, used to tell me that God
      would grant all things to those who had faith. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied the priest; &ldquo;all things are possible to Him who
      created all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Verneuil threw herself on her knees before him with
      incredible enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she cried in ecstasy, &ldquo;my faith in thee is equal to my love
      for him; inspire me! do here a miracle, or take my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your prayer will be granted,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie returned to the salon leaning on the arm of the venerable old man. A
      deep and secret emotion brought her to the arms of her lover more
      brilliant than on any of her past days, for a serenity like that which
      painters give to the martyrs added to her face an imposing dignity. She
      held out her hand to the marquis and together they advanced to the altar
      and knelt down. The marriage was about to be celebrated beside the nuptial
      bed, the altar hastily raised, the cross, the vessels, the chalice,
      secretly brought thither by the priest, the fumes of incense rising to the
      ceiling, the priest himself, who wore a stole above his cassock, the
      tapers on an altar in a salon,&mdash;all these things combined to form a
      strange and touching scene, which typified those times of saddest memory,
      when civil discord overthrew all sacred institutions. Religious ceremonies
      then had the savor of the mysteries. Children were baptized in the
      chambers where the mothers were still groaning from their labor. As in the
      olden time, the Saviour went, poor and lowly, to console the dying. Young
      girls received their first communion in the home where they had played
      since infancy. The marriage of the marquis and Mademoiselle de Verneuil
      was now solemnized, like many other unions, by a service contrary to the
      recent legal enactments. In after years these marriages, mostly celebrated
      at the foot of oaks, were scrupulously recognized and considered legal.
      The priest who thus preserved the ancient usages was one of those men who
      hold to their principles in the height of the storm. His voice, which
      never made the oath exacted by the Republic, uttered no word throughout
      the tempest that did not make for peace. He never incited, like the Abbe
      Gudin, to fire and sword; but like many others, he devoted himself to the
      still more dangerous mission of performing his priestly functions for the
      souls of faithful Catholics. To accomplish this perilous ministry he used
      all the pious deceptions necessitated by persecution, and the marquis,
      when he sought his services on this occasion, had found him in one of
      those excavated caverns which are known, even to the present day, by the
      name of &ldquo;the priest&rsquo;s hiding-place.&rdquo; The mere sight of that pale and
      suffering face was enough to give this worldly room a holy aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was now ready for the act of misery and of joy. Before beginning the
      ceremony the priest asked, in the dead silence, the names of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie-Nathalie, daughter of Mademoiselle Blanche de Casteran, abbess,
      deceased, of Notre-Dame de Seez, and Victor-Amedee, Duc de Verneuil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At La Chasterie, near Alencon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never supposed,&rdquo; said the baron in a low voice to the count, &ldquo;that
      Montauran would have the folly to marry her. The natural daughter of a
      duke!&mdash;horrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were of the king, well and good,&rdquo; replied the Comte de Bauvan,
      smiling. &ldquo;However, it is not for me to blame him; I like Charette&rsquo;s
      mistress full as well; and I shall transfer the war to her&mdash;though
      she&rsquo;s not one to bill and coo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The names of the marquis had been filled in previously, and the two lovers
      now signed the document with their witnesses. The ceremony then began. At
      that instant Marie, and she alone, heard the sound of muskets and the
      heavy tread of soldiers,&mdash;no doubt relieving the guard in the church
      which she had herself demanded. She trembled violently and raised her eyes
      to the cross on the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A saint at last,&rdquo; said Francine, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me such saints, and I&rsquo;ll be devilishly devout,&rdquo; added the count, in
      a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the priest made the customary inquiry of Mademoiselle de Verneuil,
      she answered by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; uttered with a deep sigh. Bending to her husband&rsquo;s
      ear she said: &ldquo;You will soon know why I have broken the oath I made never
      to marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the ceremony all present passed into the dining-room, where dinner
      was served, and as they took their places Jeremie, Marie&rsquo;s footman, came
      into the room terrified. The poor bride rose and went to him; Francine
      followed her. With one of those pretexts which never fail a woman, she
      begged the marquis to do the honors for a moment, and went out, taking
      Jeremie with her before he could utter the fatal words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Francine, to be dying a thousand deaths and not to die!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      This absence might well be supposed to have its cause in the ceremony that
      had just taken place. Towards the end of the dinner, as the marquis was
      beginning to feel uneasy, Marie returned in all the pomp of a bridal robe.
      Her face was calm and joyful, while that of Francine who followed her had
      terror imprinted on every feature, so that the guests might well have
      thought they saw in these two women a fantastic picture by Salvator Rosa,
      of Life and Death holding each other by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Marie to the priest, the baron, and the count, &ldquo;you are
      my guests for the night. I find you cannot leave Fougeres; it would be
      dangerous to attempt it. My good maid has instructions to make you
      comfortable in your apartments. No, you must not rebel,&rdquo; she added to the
      priest, who was about to speak. &ldquo;I hope you will not thwart a woman on her
      wedding-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later she was alone with her husband in the room she had so
      joyously arranged a few hours earlier. They had reached that fatal bed
      where, like a tomb, so many hopes are wrecked, where the waking to a happy
      life is all uncertain, where love is born or dies, according to the
      natures that are tried there. Marie looked at the clock. &ldquo;Six hours to
      live,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have slept?&rdquo; she cried toward morning, wakening with one of those
      sudden movements which rouse us when we have made ourselves a promise to
      wake at a certain hour. &ldquo;Yes, I have slept,&rdquo; she thought, seeing by the
      light of the candles that the hands of the clock were pointing to two in
      the morning. She turned and looked at the sleeping marquis, lying like a
      child with his head on one hand, the other clasping his wife&rsquo;s hand, his
      lips half smiling as though he had fallen asleep while she kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;he sleeps like an infant; he does not
      distrust me&mdash;me, to whom he has given a happiness without a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She touched him softly and he woke, continuing to smile. He kissed the
      hand he held and looked at the wretched woman with eyes so sparkling that
      she could not endure their light and slowly lowered her large eyelids. Her
      husband might justly have accused her of coquetry if she were not
      concealing the terrors of her soul by thus evading the fire of his looks.
      Together they raised their charming heads and made each other a sign of
      gratitude for the pleasures they had tasted; but after a rapid glance at
      the beautiful picture his wife presented, the marquis was struck with an
      expression on her face which seemed to him melancholy, and he said in a
      tender voice, &ldquo;Why sad, dear love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Alphonse,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;do you know to what I have led you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shuddering with horror she sprang from the bed; the marquis, astonished,
      followed her. His wife motioned him to a window and raised the curtain,
      pointing as she did so to a score of soldiers. The moon had scattered the
      fog and was now casting her white light on the muskets and the uniforms,
      on the impassible Corentin pacing up and down like a jackal waiting for
      his prey, on the commandant, standing still, his arms crossed, his nose in
      the air, his lips curling, watchful and displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Marie, leave them and come back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you smile? I placed them there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other for a moment. The marquis divined the whole
      truth, and he took her in his arms. &ldquo;No matter!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you
      still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is not lost!&rdquo; cried Marie, &ldquo;it cannot be! Alphonse,&rdquo; she said after a
      pause, &ldquo;there is hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they distinctly heard the owl&rsquo;s cry, and Francine entered
      from the dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre has come!&rdquo; she said with a joy that was like delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise and Francine dressed Montauran in Chouan clothes with that
      amazing rapidity that belongs only to women. As soon as Marie saw her
      husband loading the gun Francine had brought in she slipped hastily from
      the room with a sign to her faithful maid. Francine then took the marquis
      to the dressing-room adjoining the bed-chamber. The young man seeing a
      large number of sheets knotted firmly together, perceived the means by
      which the girl expected him to escape the vigilance of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get through there,&rdquo; he said, examining the bull&rsquo;s-eye window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant it was darkened by a thickset figure, and a hoarse voice,
      known to Francine, said in a whisper, &ldquo;Make haste, general, those rascally
      Blues are stirring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! one more kiss,&rdquo; said a trembling voice beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis, whose feet were already on the liberating ladder, though he
      was not wholly through the window, felt his neck clasped with a despairing
      pressure. Seeing that his wife had put on his clothes, he tried to detain
      her; but she tore herself roughly from his arms and he was forced to
      descend. In his hand he held a fragment of some stuff which the moonlight
      showed him was a piece of the waistcoat he had worn the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words uttered by Hulot in the midst of a silence that was almost
      horrible broke the spell which seemed to hold the men and their
      surroundings. A volley of balls coming from the valley and reaching to the
      foot of the tower succeeded the discharges of the Blues posted on the
      Promenade. Not a cry came from the Chouans. Between each discharge the
      silence was frightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corentin had heard a fall from the ladder on the precipice side of the
      tower, and he suspected some ruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of those animals are growling,&rdquo; he said to Hulot; &ldquo;our lovers are
      capable of fooling us on this side, and escaping themselves on the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spy, to clear up the mystery, sent for torches; Hulot, understanding
      the force of Corentin&rsquo;s supposition, and hearing the noise of a serious
      struggle in the direction of the Porte Saint-Leonard, rushed to the
      guard-house exclaiming: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, they won&rsquo;t separate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His head is well-riddled, commandant,&rdquo; said Beau-Pied, who was the first
      to meet him, &ldquo;but he killed Gudin, and wounded two men. Ha! the savage; he
      got through three ranks of our best men and would have reached the fields
      if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the sentry at the gate who spitted him on his
      bayonet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant rushed into the guard-room and saw on a camp bedstead a
      bloody body which had just been laid there. He went up to the supposed
      marquis, raised the hat which covered the face, and fell into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected it!&rdquo; he cried, crossing his arms violently; &ldquo;she kept him,
      cursed thunder! too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers stood about, motionless. The commandant himself unfastened
      the long black hair of a woman. Suddenly the silence was broken by the
      tramp of men and Corentin entered the guardroom, preceding four soldiers
      who bore on their guns, crossed to make a litter, the body of Montauran,
      who was shot in the thighs and arms. They laid him on the bedstead beside
      his wife. He saw her, and found strength to clasp her hand with a
      convulsive gesture. The dying woman turned her head, recognized her
      husband, and shuddered with a spasm that was horrible to see, murmuring in
      a voice almost extinct: &ldquo;A day without a morrow! God heard me too well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; said the marquis, collecting all his strength, and still
      holding Marie&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I count on your honor to send the news of my death
      to my young brother, who is now in London. Write him that if he wishes to
      obey my last injunction he will never bear arms against his country&mdash;neither
      must he abandon the king&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; said Hulot, pressing the hand of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them to the nearest hospital,&rdquo; cried Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hulot took the spy by the arm with a grip that left the imprint of his
      fingers on the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of this camp!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;your business is done here. Look well at
      the face of Commander Hulot, and never find yourself again in his way if
      you don&rsquo;t want your belly to be the scabbard of his blade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the older soldier flourished his sabre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of the honest men who will never make their way,&rdquo; said
      Corentin to himself when he was some distance from the guard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was still able to thank his gallant adversary by a look
      marking the respect which all soldiers feel for loyal enemies.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In 1827 an old man accompanied by his wife was buying cattle in the
      market-place of Fougeres. Few persons remembered that he had killed a
      hundred or more men, and that his former name was Marche-a-Terre. A person
      to whom we owe important information about all the personages of this
      drama saw him there, leading a cow, and was struck by his simple,
      ingenuous air, which led her to remark, &ldquo;That must be a worthy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Cibot, otherwise called Pille-Miche, we already know his end. It is
      likely that Marche-a-Terre made some attempt to save his comrade from the
      scaffold; possibly he was in the square at Alencon on the occasion of the
      frightful tumult which was one of the events of the famous trial of
      Rifoel, Briond, and la Chanterie.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
