        PREPARER&rsquo;S NOTE
      </h3>
      <p>
        A Distinguished Provincial at Paris is part two of a trilogy. Part one,
        Two Poets, begins the story of Lucien, his sister Eve, and his friend
        David in the provincial town of Angouleme. Part two is centered on
        Lucien&rsquo;s Parisian life. Part three, Eve and David, reverts to the
        setting of Angouleme. In many references parts one and three are
        combined under the title Lost Illusions and A Distinguished Provincial
        at Paris is given its individual title. Following this trilogy Lucien&rsquo;s
        story is continued in another book, Scenes from a Courtesan&rsquo;s Life.

    <h2>
      PART I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton and Lucien de Rubempre had left Angouleme behind, and
      were traveling together upon the road to Paris. Not one of the party who
      made that journey alluded to it afterwards; but it may be believed that an
      infatuated youth who had looked forward to the delights of an elopement,
      must have found the continual presence of Gentil, the man-servant, and
      Albertine, the maid, not a little irksome on the way. Lucien, traveling
      post for the first time in his life, was horrified to see pretty nearly
      the whole sum on which he meant to live in Paris for a twelvemonth dropped
      along the road. Like other men who combine great intellectual powers with
      the charming simplicity of childhood, he openly expressed his surprise at
      the new and wonderful things which he saw, and thereby made a mistake. A
      man should study a woman very carefully before he allows her to see his
      thoughts and emotions as they arise in him. A woman, whose nature is large
      as her heart is tender, can smile upon childishness, and make allowances;
      but let her have ever so small a spice of vanity herself, and she cannot
      forgive childishness, or littleness, or vanity in her lover. Many a woman
      is so extravagant a worshiper that she must always see the god in her
      idol; but there are yet others who love a man for his sake and not for
      their own, and adore his failings with his greater qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had not guessed as yet that Mme. de Bargeton&rsquo;s love was grafted on
      pride. He made another mistake when he failed to discern the meaning of
      certain smiles which flitted over Louise&rsquo;s lips from time to time; and
      instead of keeping himself to himself, he indulged in the playfulness of
      the young rat emerging from his hole for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travelers were set down before daybreak at the sign of the
      Gaillard-Bois in the Rue de l&rsquo;Echelle, both so tired out with the journey
      that Louise went straight to bed and slept, first bidding Lucien to engage
      the room immediately overhead. Lucien slept on till four o&rsquo;clock in the
      afternoon, when he was awakened by Mme. de Bargeton&rsquo;s servant, and
      learning the hour, made a hasty toilet and hurried downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise was sitting in the shabby inn sitting-room. Hotel accommodation is
      a blot on the civilization of Paris; for with all its pretensions to
      elegance, the city as yet does not boast a single inn where a well-to-do
      traveler can find the surroundings to which he is accustomed at home. To
      Lucien&rsquo;s just-awakened, sleep-dimmed eyes, Louise was hardly recognizable
      in this cheerless, sunless room, with the shabby window-curtains, the
      comfortless polished floor, the hideous furniture bought second-hand, or
      much the worse for wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people no longer look the same when detached from the background of
      faces, objects, and surroundings which serve as a setting, without which,
      indeed, they seem to lose something of their intrinsic worth. Personality
      demands its appropriate atmosphere to bring out its values, just as the
      figures in Flemish interiors need the arrangement of light and shade in
      which they are placed by the painter&rsquo;s genius if they are to live for us.
      This is especially true of provincials. Mme. de Bargeton, moreover, looked
      more thoughtful and dignified than was necessary now, when no barriers
      stood between her and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentil and Albertine waited upon them, and while they were present Lucien
      could not complain. The dinner, sent in from a neighboring restaurant,
      fell far below the provincial average, both in quantity and quality; the
      essential goodness of country fare was wanting, and in point of quantity
      the portions were cut with so strict an eye to business that they savored
      of short commons. In such small matters Paris does not show its best side
      to travelers of moderate fortune. Lucien waited till the meal was over.
      Some change had come over Louise, he thought, but he could not explain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a change had, in fact, taken place. Events had occurred while he
      slept; for reflection is an event in our inner history, and Mme. de
      Bargeton had been reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, Sixte du Chatelet made his appearance in
      the Rue de l&rsquo;Echelle and asked for Albertine. The sleeping damsel was
      roused, and to her he expressed his wish to speak with her mistress. Mme.
      de Bargeton had scarcely time to dress before he came back again. The
      unaccountable apparition of M. du Chatelet roused the lady&rsquo;s curiosity,
      for she had kept her journey a profound secret, as she thought. At three
      o&rsquo;clock the visitor was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have risked a reprimand from headquarters to follow you,&rdquo; he said, as
      he greeted her; &ldquo;I foresaw coming events. But if I lose my post for it,
      YOU, at any rate, shall not be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see plainly that you love Lucien,&rdquo; he continued, with an air of
      tender resignation. &ldquo;You must love indeed if <i>you</i> can act thus
      recklessly, and disregard the conventions which you know so well. Dear
      adored Nais, can you really imagine that Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s salon, or any
      other salon in Paris, will not be closed to you as soon as it is known
      that you have fled from Angouleme, as it were, with a young man,
      especially after the duel between M. de Bargeton and M. de Chandour? The
      fact that your husband has gone to the Escarbas looks like a separation.
      Under such circumstances a gentleman fights first and afterwards leaves
      his wife at liberty. By all means, give M. de Rubempre your love and your
      countenance; do just as you please; but you must not live in the same
      house. If anybody here in Paris knew that you had traveled together, the
      whole world that you have a mind to see would point the finger at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Nais, do not make these sacrifices for a young man whom you have as
      yet compared with no one else; he, on his side, has been put to no proof;
      he may forsake you for some Parisienne, better able, as he may fancy, to
      further his ambitions. I mean no harm to the man you love, but you will
      permit me to put your own interests before his, and to beg you to study
      him, to be fully aware of the serious nature of this step that you are
      taking. And, then, if you find all doors closed against you, and that none
      of the women call upon you, make sure at least that you will feel no
      regret for all that you have renounced for him. Be very certain first that
      he for whom you will have given up so much will always be worthy of your
      sacrifices and appreciate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; continued Chatelet, &ldquo;Mme. d&rsquo;Espard is the more prudish and
      particular because she herself is separated from her husband, nobody knows
      why. The Navarreins, the Lenoncourts, the Blamont-Chauvrys, and the rest
      of the relations have all rallied round her; the most strait-laced women
      are seen at her house, and receive her with respect, and the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Espard has been put in the wrong. The first call that you pay will make
      it clear to you that I am right; indeed, knowing Paris as I do, I can tell
      you beforehand that you will no sooner enter the Marquise&rsquo;s salon than you
      will be in despair lest she should find out that you are staying at the
      Gaillard-Bois with an apothecary&rsquo;s son, though he may wish to be called M.
      de Rubempre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have rivals here, women far more astute and shrewd than Amelie;
      they will not fail to discover who you are, where you are, where you come
      from, and all that you are doing. You have counted upon your incognito, I
      see, but you are one of those women for whom an incognito is out of the
      question. You will meet Angouleme at every turn. There are the deputies
      from the Charente coming up for the opening of the session; there is the
      Commandant in Paris on leave. Why, the first man or woman from Angouleme
      who happens to see you would cut your career short in a strange fashion.
      You would simply be Lucien&rsquo;s mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you need me at any time, I am staying with the Receiver-General in the
      Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, two steps away from Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s. I am
      sufficiently acquainted with the Marechale de Carigliano, Mme. de Serizy,
      and the President of the Council to introduce you to those houses; but you
      will meet so many people at Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s, that you are not likely to
      require me. So far from wishing to gain admittance to this set or that,
      every one will be longing to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatelet talked on; Mme. de Bargeton made no interruption. She was struck
      with his perspicacity. The queen of Angouleme had, in fact, counted upon
      preserving her incognito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear friend,&rdquo; she said at length; &ldquo;but what am I to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to find suitable furnished lodgings for you,&rdquo; suggested
      Chatelet; &ldquo;that way of living is less expensive than an inn. You will have
      a home of your own; and, if you will take my advice, you will sleep in
      your new rooms this very night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you know my address?&rdquo; queried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your traveling carriage is easily recognized; and, besides, I was
      following you. At Sevres your postilion told mine that he had brought you
      here. Will you permit me to act as your harbinger? I will write as soon as
      I have found lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, do so,&rdquo; said she. And in those seemingly insignificant words,
      all was said. The Baron du Chatelet had spoken the language of worldly
      wisdom to a woman of the world. He had made his appearance before her in
      faultless dress, a neat cab was waiting for him at the door; and Mme. de
      Bargeton, standing by the window thinking over the position, chanced to
      see the elderly dandy drive away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Lucien appeared, half awake and hastily dressed. He
      was handsome, it is true; but his clothes, his last year&rsquo;s nankeen
      trousers, and his shabby tight jacket were ridiculous. Put Antinous or the
      Apollo Belvedere himself into a water-carrier&rsquo;s blouse, and how shall you
      recognize the godlike creature of the Greek or Roman chisel? The eyes note
      and compare before the heart has time to revise the swift involuntary
      judgment; and the contrast between Lucien and Chatelet was so abrupt that
      it could not fail to strike Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards six o&rsquo;clock that evening, when dinner was over, Mme. de Bargeton
      beckoned Lucien to sit beside her on the shabby sofa, covered with a
      flowered chintz&mdash;a yellow pattern on a red ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucien mine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think that if we have both of us done
      a foolish thing, suicidal for both our interests, it would only be common
      sense to set matters right? We ought not to live together in Paris, dear
      boy, and we must not allow anyone to suspect that we traveled together.
      Your career depends so much upon my position that I ought to do nothing to
      spoil it. So, to-night, I am going to remove into lodgings near by. But
      you will stay on here, we can see each other every day, and nobody can say
      a word against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Louise explained conventions to Lucien, who opened wide eyes. He had
      still to learn that when a woman thinks better of her folly, she thinks
      better of her love; but one thing he understood&mdash;he saw that he was
      no longer the Lucien of Angouleme. Louise talked of herself, of <i>her</i>
      interests, <i>her</i> reputation, and of the world; and, to veil her
      egoism, she tried to make him believe that this was all on his account. He
      had no claim upon Louise thus suddenly transformed into Mme. de Bargeton,
      and, more serious still, he had no power over her. He could not keep back
      the tears that filled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am your glory,&rdquo; cried the poet, &ldquo;you are yet more to me&mdash;you
      are my one hope, my whole future rests with you. I thought that if you
      meant to make my successes yours, you would surely make my adversity yours
      also, and here we are going to part already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are judging my conduct,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you do not love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien looked at her with such a dolorous expression, that in spite of
      herself, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, I will stay if you like. We shall both be ruined, we shall have
      no one to come to our aid. But when we are both equally wretched, and
      every one shuts their door upon us both, when failure (for we must look
      all possibilities in the face), when failure drives us back to the
      Escarbas, then remember, love, that I foresaw the end, and that at the
      first I proposed that we should make your way by conforming to established
      rules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; he cried, with his arms around her, &ldquo;you are wise; you frighten
      me! Remember that I am a child, that I have given myself up entirely to
      your dear will. I myself should have preferred to overcome obstacles and
      win my way among men by the power that is in me; but if I can reach the
      goal sooner through your aid, I shall be very glad to owe all my success
      to you. Forgive me! You mean so much to me that I cannot help fearing all
      kinds of things; and, for me, parting means that desertion is at hand, and
      desertion is death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear boy, the world&rsquo;s demands are soon satisfied,&rdquo; returned she.
      &ldquo;You must sleep here; that is all. All day long you will be with me, and
      no one can say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few kisses set Lucien&rsquo;s mind completely at rest. An hour later Gentil
      brought in a note from Chatelet. He told Mme. de Bargeton that he had
      found lodgings for her in the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg. Mme. de Bargeton
      informed herself of the exact place, and found that it was not very far
      from the Rue de l&rsquo;Echelle. &ldquo;We shall be neighbors,&rdquo; she told Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours afterwards Louise stepped into the hired carriage sent by
      Chatelet for the removal to the new rooms. The apartments were of the
      class that upholsterers furnish and let to wealthy deputies and persons of
      consideration on a short visit to Paris&mdash;showy and uncomfortable. It
      was eleven o&rsquo;clock when Lucien returned to his inn, having seen nothing as
      yet of Paris except the part of the Rue Saint-Honore which lies between
      the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg and the Rue de l&rsquo;Echelle. He lay down in his
      miserable little room, and could not help comparing it in his own mind
      with Louise&rsquo;s sumptuous apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he came away the Baron du Chatelet came in, gorgeously arrayed in
      evening dress, fresh from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to inquire
      whether Mme. de Bargeton was satisfied with all that he had done on her
      behalf. Nais was uneasy. The splendor was alarming to her mind. Provincial
      life had reacted upon her; she was painfully conscientious over her
      accounts, and economical to a degree that is looked upon as miserly in
      Paris. She had brought with her twenty thousand francs in the shape of a
      draft on the Receiver-General, considering that the sum would more than
      cover the expenses of four years in Paris; she was afraid already lest she
      should not have enough, and should run into debt; and now Chatelet told
      her that her rooms would only cost six hundred francs per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere trifle,&rdquo; added he, seeing that Nais was startled. &ldquo;For five
      hundred francs a month you can have a carriage from a livery stable; fifty
      louis in all. You need only think of your dress. A woman moving in good
      society could not well do less; and if you mean to obtain a
      Receiver-General&rsquo;s appointment for M. de Bargeton, or a post in the
      Household, you ought not to look poverty-stricken. Here, in Paris, they
      only give to the rich. It is most fortunate that you brought Gentil to go
      out with you, and Albertine for your own woman, for servants are enough to
      ruin you here. But with your introductions you will seldom be home to a
      meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton and the Baron de Chatelet chatted about Paris. Chatelet
      gave her all the news of the day, the myriad nothings that you are bound
      to know, under penalty of being a nobody. Before very long the Baron also
      gave advice as to shopping, recommending Herbault for toques and Juliette
      for hats and bonnets; he added the address of a fashionable dressmaker to
      supersede Victorine. In short, he made the lady see the necessity of
      rubbing off Angouleme. Then he took his leave after a final flash of happy
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect I shall have a box at one of the theatres to-morrow,&rdquo; he
      remarked carelessly; &ldquo;I will call for you and M. de Rubempre, for you must
      allow me to do the honors of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more generosity in his character than I thought,&rdquo; said Mme. de
      Bargeton to herself when Lucien was included in the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of June ministers are often puzzled to know what to do with
      boxes at the theatre; ministerialist deputies and their constituents are
      busy in their vineyards or harvest fields, and their more exacting
      acquaintances are in the country or traveling about; so it comes to pass
      that the best seats are filled at this season with heterogeneous
      theatre-goers, never seen at any other time of year, and the house is apt
      to look as if it were tapestried with very shabby material. Chatelet had
      thought already that this was his opportunity of giving Nais the
      amusements which provincials crave most eagerly, and that with very little
      expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the very first morning in Paris, Lucien went to the Rue
      Nueve-de-Luxembourg and found that Louise had gone out. She had gone to
      make some indispensable purchases, to take counsel of the mighty and
      illustrious authorities in the matter of the feminine toilette, pointed
      out to her by Chatelet, for she had written to tell the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard
      of her arrival. Mme. de Bargeton possessed the self-confidence born of a
      long habit of rule, but she was exceedingly afraid of appearing to be
      provincial. She had tact enough to know how greatly the relations of women
      among themselves depend upon first impressions; and though she felt that
      she was equal to taking her place at once in such a distinguished set as
      Mme. de d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s, she felt also that she stood in need of goodwill at
      her first entrance into society, and was resolved, in the first place,
      that she would leave nothing undone to secure success. So she felt
      boundlessly thankful to Chatelet for pointing out these ways of putting
      herself in harmony with the fashionable world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular chance so ordered it that the Marquise was delighted to find an
      opportunity of being useful to a connection of her husband&rsquo;s family. The
      Marquis d&rsquo;Espard had withdrawn himself without apparent reason from
      society, and ceased to take any active interest in affairs, political or
      domestic. His wife, thus left mistress of her actions, felt the need of
      the support of public opinion, and was glad to take the Marquis&rsquo; place and
      give her countenance to one of her husband&rsquo;s relations. She meant to be
      ostentatiously gracious, so as to put her husband more evidently in the
      wrong; and that very day she wrote, &ldquo;Mme. de Bargeton <i>nee</i>
      Negrepelisse&rdquo; a charming billet, one of the prettily worded compositions
      of which time alone can discover the emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was delighted that circumstances had brought a relative, of whom she
      had heard, whose acquaintance she had desired to make, into closer
      connection with her family. Friendships in Paris were not so solid but
      that she longed to find one more to love on earth; and if this might not
      be, there would only be one more illusion to bury with the rest. She put
      herself entirely at her cousin&rsquo;s disposal. She would have called upon her
      if indisposition had not kept her to the house, and she felt that she lay
      already under obligations to the cousin who had thought of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, meanwhile, taking his first ramble along the Rue de la Paix and
      through the Boulevards, like all newcomers, was much more interested in
      the things that he saw than in the people he met. The general effect of
      Paris is wholly engrossing at first. The wealth in the shop windows, the
      high houses, the streams of traffic, the contrast everywhere between the
      last extremes of luxury and want struck him more than anything else. In
      his astonishment at the crowds of strange faces, the man of imaginative
      temper felt as if he himself had shrunk, as it were, immensely. A man of
      any consequence in his native place, where he cannot go out but he meets
      with some recognition of his importance at every step, does not readily
      accustom himself to the sudden and total extinction of his consequence.
      You are somebody in your own country, in Paris you are nobody. The
      transition between the first state and the last should be made gradually,
      for the too abrupt fall is something like annihilation. Paris could not
      fail to be an appalling wilderness for a young poet, who looked for an
      echo for all his sentiments, a confidant for all his thoughts, a soul to
      share his least sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had not gone in search of his luggage and his best blue coat; and
      painfully conscious of the shabbiness, to say no worse, of his clothes, he
      went to Mme. de Bargeton, feeling that she must have returned. He found
      the Baron du Chatelet, who carried them both off to dinner at the <i>Rocher
      de Cancale</i>. Lucien&rsquo;s head was dizzy with the whirl of Paris, the Baron
      was in the carriage, he could say nothing to Louise, but he squeezed her
      hand, and she gave a warm response to the mute confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Chatelet took his guests to the Vaudeville. Lucien, in his
      heart, was not over well pleased to see Chatelet again, and cursed the
      chance that had brought the Baron to Paris. The Baron said that ambition
      had brought him to town; he had hopes of an appointment as
      secretary-general to a government department, and meant to take a seat in
      the Council of State as Master of Requests. He had come to Paris to ask
      for fulfilment of the promises that had been given him, for a man of his
      stamp could not be expected to remain a comptroller all his life; he would
      rather be nothing at all, and offer himself for election as deputy, or
      re-enter diplomacy. Chatelet grew visibly taller; Lucien dimly began to
      recognize in this elderly beau the superiority of the man of the world who
      knows Paris; and, most of all, he felt ashamed to owe his evening&rsquo;s
      amusement to his rival. And while the poet looked ill at ease and awkward
      Her Royal Highness&rsquo; ex-secretary was quite in his element. He smiled at
      his rival&rsquo;s hesitations, at his astonishment, at the questions he put, at
      the little mistakes which the latter ignorantly made, much as an old salt
      laughs at an apprentice who has not found his sea legs; but Lucien&rsquo;s
      pleasure at seeing a play for the first time in Paris outweighed the
      annoyance of these small humiliations.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening marked an epoch in Lucien&rsquo;s career; he put away a good many
      of his ideas as to provincial life in the course of it. His horizon
      widened; society assumed different proportions. There were fair
      Parisiennes in fresh and elegant toilettes all about him; Mme. de
      Bargeton&rsquo;s costume, tolerably ambitious though it was, looked dowdy by
      comparison; the material, like the fashion and the color, was out of date.
      That way of arranging her hair, so bewitching in Angouleme, looked
      frightfully ugly here among the daintily devised coiffures which he saw in
      every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she always look like that?&rdquo; said he to himself, ignorant that the
      morning had been spent in preparing a transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the provinces comparison and choice are out of the question; when a
      face has grown familiar it comes to possess a certain beauty that is taken
      for granted. But transport the pretty woman of the provinces to Paris, and
      no one takes the slightest notice of her; her prettiness is of the
      comparative degree illustrated by the saying that among the blind the
      one-eyed are kings. Lucien&rsquo;s eyes were now busy comparing Mme. de Bargeton
      with other women, just as she herself had contrasted him with Chatelet on
      the previous day. And Mme. de Bargeton, on her part, permitted herself
      some strange reflections upon her lover. The poet cut a poor figure
      notwithstanding his singular beauty. The sleeves of his jacket were too
      short; with his ill-cut country gloves and a waistcoat too scanty for him,
      he looked prodigiously ridiculous, compared with the young men in the
      balcony&mdash;&ldquo;positively pitiable,&rdquo; thought Mme. de Bargeton. Chatelet,
      interested in her without presumption, taking care of her in a manner that
      revealed a profound passion; Chatelet, elegant, and as much at home as an
      actor treading the familiar boards of his theatre, in two days had
      recovered all the ground lost in the past six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinary people will not admit that our sentiments towards each other can
      totally change in a moment, and yet certain it is, that two lovers not
      seldom fly apart even more quickly than they drew together. In Mme. de
      Bargeton and in Lucien a process of disenchantment was at work; Paris was
      the cause. Life had widened out before the poet&rsquo;s eyes, as society came to
      wear a new aspect for Louise. Nothing but an accident now was needed to
      sever finally the bond that united them; nor was that blow, so terrible
      for Lucien, very long delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton set Lucien down at his inn, and drove home with Chatelet,
      to the intense vexation of the luckless lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they say about me?&rdquo; he wondered, as he climbed the stairs to
      his dismal room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor fellow is uncommonly dull,&rdquo; said Chatelet, with a smile, when
      the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the way with those who have a world of thoughts in their heart
      and brain. Men who have so much in them to give out in great works long
      dreamed of, profess a certain contempt for conversation, a commerce in
      which the intellect spends itself in small change,&rdquo; returned the haughty
      Negrepelisse. She still had courage to defend Lucien, but less for
      Lucien&rsquo;s sake than for her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it you willingly,&rdquo; replied the Baron, &ldquo;but we live with human
      beings and not with books. There, dear Nais! I see how it is, there is
      nothing between you yet, and I am delighted that it is so. If you decide
      to bring an interest of a kind hitherto lacking into your life, let it not
      be this so-called genius, I implore you. How if you have made a mistake?
      Suppose that in a few days&rsquo; time, when you have compared him with men whom
      you will meet, men of real ability, men who have distinguished themselves
      in good earnest; suppose that you should discover, dear and fair siren,
      that it is no lyre-bearer that you have borne into port on your dazzling
      shoulders, but a little ape, with no manners and no capacity; a
      presumptuous fool who may be a wit in L&rsquo;Houmeau, but turns out a very
      ordinary specimen of a young man in Paris? And, after all, volumes of
      verse come out every week here, the worst of them better than all M.
      Chardon&rsquo;s poetry put together. For pity&rsquo;s sake, wait and compare!
      To-morrow, Friday, is Opera night,&rdquo; he continued as the carriage turned
      into the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg; &ldquo;Mme. d&rsquo;Espard has the box of the First
      Gentlemen of the Chamber, and will take you, no doubt. I shall go to Mme.
      de Serizy&rsquo;s box to behold you in your glory. They are giving <i>Les
      Danaides</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Mme. de Bargeton tried to arrange a suitable toilette in
      which to call on her cousin, Mme. d&rsquo;Espard. The weather was rather chilly.
      Looking through the dowdy wardrobe from Angouleme, she found nothing
      better than a certain green velvet gown, trimmed fantastically enough.
      Lucien, for his part, felt that he must go at once for his celebrated blue
      best coat; he felt aghast at the thought of his tight jacket, and
      determined to be well dressed, lest he should meet the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard
      or receive a sudden summons to her house. He must have his luggage at
      once, so he took a cab, and in two hours&rsquo; time spent three or four francs,
      matter for much subsequent reflection on the scale of the cost of living
      in Paris. Having dressed himself in his best, such as it was, he went to
      the Rue Nueve-de-Luxembourg, and on the doorstep encountered Gentil in
      company with a gorgeously be-feathered chasseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going round to you, sir, madame gave me a line for you,&rdquo; said
      Gentil, ignorant of Parisian forms of respect, and accustomed to homely
      provincial ways. The chasseur took the poet for a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien tore open the note, and learned that Mme. de Bargeton had gone to
      spend the day with the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard. She was going to the Opera in
      the evening, but she told Lucien to be there to meet her. Her cousin
      permitted her to give him a seat in her box. The Marquise d&rsquo;Espard was
      delighted to procure the young poet that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she loves me! my fears were all nonsense!&rdquo; said Lucien to himself.
      &ldquo;She is going to present me to her cousin this very evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped for joy. He would spend the day that separated him from the
      happy evening as joyously as might be. He dashed out in the direction of
      the Tuileries, dreaming of walking there until it was time to dine at
      Very&rsquo;s. And now, behold Lucien frisking and skipping, light of foot
      because light of heart, on his way to the Terrasse des Feuillants to take
      a look at the people of quality on promenade there. Pretty women walk
      arm-in-arm with men of fashion, their adorers, couples greet each other
      with a glance as they pass; how different it is from the terrace at
      Beaulieu! How far finer the birds on this perch than the Angouleme
      species! It is as if you beheld all the colors that glow in the plumage of
      the feathered tribes of India and America, instead of the sober European
      families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were two wretched hours that Lucien spent in the Garden of the
      Tuileries. A violent revulsion swept through him, and he sat in judgment
      upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, not a single one of these gilded youths wore a
      swallow-tail coat. The few exceptions, one or two poor wretches, a clerk
      here and there, an annuitant from the Marais, could be ruled out on the
      score of age; and hard upon the discovery of a distinction between morning
      and evening dress, the poet&rsquo;s quick sensibility and keen eyes saw likewise
      that his shabby old clothes were not fit to be seen; the defects in his
      coat branded that garment as ridiculous; the cut was old-fashioned, the
      color was the wrong shade of blue, the collar outrageously ungainly, the
      coat tails, by dint of long wear, overlapped each other, the buttons were
      reddened, and there were fatal white lines along the seams. Then his
      waistcoat was too short, and so grotesquely provincial, that he hastily
      buttoned his coat over it; and, finally, no man of any pretension to
      fashion wore nankeen trousers. Well-dressed men wore charming fancy
      materials or immaculate white, and every one had straps to his trousers,
      while the shrunken hems of Lucien&rsquo;s nether garments manifested a violent
      antipathy for the heels of boots which they wedded with obvious
      reluctance. Lucien wore a white cravat with embroidered ends; his sister
      had seen that M. du Hautoy and M. de Chandour wore such things, and
      hastened to make similar ones for her brother. Here, no one appeared to
      wear white cravats of a morning except a few grave seniors, elderly
      capitalists, and austere public functionaries, until, in the street on the
      other side of the railings, Lucien noticed a grocer&rsquo;s boy walking along
      the Rue de Rivoli with a basket on his head; him the man of Angouleme
      detected in the act of sporting a cravat, with both ends adorned by the
      handiwork of some adored shop-girl. The sight was a stab to Lucien&rsquo;s
      breast; penetrating straight to that organ as yet undefined, the seat of
      our sensibility, the region whither, since sentiment has had any
      existence, the sons of men carry their hands in any excess of joy or
      anguish. Do not accuse this chronicle of puerility. The rich, to be sure,
      never having experienced sufferings of this kind, may think them
      incredibly petty and small; but the agonies of less fortunate mortals are
      as well worth our attention as crises and vicissitudes in the lives of the
      mighty and privileged ones of earth. Is not the pain equally great for
      either? Suffering exalts all things. And, after all, suppose that we
      change the terms and for a suit of clothes, more or less fine, put instead
      a ribbon, or a star, or a title; have not brilliant careers been tormented
      by reason of such apparent trifles as these? Add, moreover, that for those
      people who must seem to have that which they have not, the question of
      clothes is of enormous importance, and not unfrequently the appearance of
      possession is the shortest road to possession at a later day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold sweat broke out over Lucien as he bethought himself that to-night
      he must make his first appearance before the Marquise in this dress&mdash;the
      Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, relative of a First Gentleman of the Bedchamber, a
      woman whose house was frequented by the most illustrious among illustrious
      men in every field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look like an apothecary&rsquo;s son, a regular shop-drudge,&rdquo; he raged
      inwardly, watching the youth of the Faubourg Saint-Germain pass under his
      eyes; graceful, spruce, fashionably dressed, with a certain uniformity of
      air, a sameness due to a fineness of contour, and a certain dignity of
      carriage and expression; though, at the same time, each one differed from
      the rest in the setting by which he had chosen to bring his personal
      characteristics into prominence. Each one made the most of his personal
      advantages. Young men in Paris understand the art of presenting themselves
      quite as well as women. Lucien had inherited from his mother the
      invaluable physical distinction of race, but the metal was still in the
      ore, and not set free by the craftsman&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair was badly cut. Instead of holding himself upright with an elastic
      corset, he felt that he was cooped up inside a hideous shirt-collar; he
      hung his dejected head without resistance on the part of a limp cravat.
      What woman could guess that a handsome foot was hidden by the clumsy boots
      which he had brought from Angouleme? What young man could envy him his
      graceful figure, disguised by the shapeless blue sack which hitherto he
      had mistakenly believed to be a coat? What bewitching studs he saw on
      those dazzling white shirt fronts, his own looked dingy by comparison; and
      how marvelously all these elegant persons were gloved, his own gloves were
      only fit for a policeman! Yonder was a youth toying with a cane
      exquisitely mounted; there, another with dainty gold studs in his
      wristbands. Yet another was twisting a charming riding-whip while he
      talked with a woman; there were specks of mud on the ample folds of his
      white trousers, he wore clanking spurs and a tight-fitting jacket,
      evidently he was about to mount one of the two horses held by a
      hop-o&rsquo;-my-thumb of a tiger. A young man who went past drew a watch no
      thicker than a five-franc piece from his pocket, and looked at it with the
      air of a person who is either too early or too late for an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, seeing these petty trifles, hitherto unimagined, became aware of a
      whole world of indispensable superfluities, and shuddered to think of the
      enormous capital needed by a professional pretty fellow! The more he
      admired these gay and careless beings, the more conscious he grew of his
      own outlandishness; he knew that he looked like a man who has no idea of
      the direction of the streets, who stands close to the Palais Royal and
      cannot find it, and asks his way to the Louvre of a passer-by, who tells
      him, &ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; Lucien saw a great gulf fixed between him and this
      new world, and asked himself how he might cross over, for he meant to be
      one of these delicate, slim youths of Paris, these young patricians who
      bowed before women divinely dressed and divinely fair. For one kiss from
      one of these, Lucien was ready to be cut in pieces like Count Philip of
      Konigsmark. Louise&rsquo;s face rose up somewhere in the shadowy background of
      memory&mdash;compared with these queens, she looked like an old woman. He
      saw women whose names will appear in the history of the nineteenth
      century, women no less famous than the queens of past times for their wit,
      their beauty, or their lovers; one who passed was the heroine Mlle. des
      Touches, so well known as Camille Maupin, the great woman of letters,
      great by her intellect, great no less by her beauty. He overheard the name
      pronounced by those who went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;she is Poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was Mme. de Bargeton in comparison with this angel in all the glory
      of youth, and hope, and promise of the future, with that sweet smile of
      hers, and the great dark eyes with all heaven in them, and the glowing
      light of the sun? She was laughing and chatting with Mme. Firmiani, one of
      the most charming women in Paris. A voice indeed cried, &ldquo;Intellect is the
      lever by which to move the world,&rdquo; but another voice cried no less loudly
      that money was the fulcrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not stay any longer on the scene of his collapse and defeat, and
      went towards the Palais Royal. He did not know the topography of his
      quarter yet, and was obliged to ask his way. Then he went to Very&rsquo;s and
      ordered dinner by way of an initiation into the pleasures of Paris, and a
      solace for his discouragement. A bottle of Bordeaux, oysters from Ostend,
      a dish of fish, a partridge, a dish of macaroni and dessert,&mdash;this
      was the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of his desire. He enjoyed this little
      debauch, studying the while how to give the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard proof of his
      wit, and redeem the shabbiness of his grotesque accoutrements by the
      display of intellectual riches. The total of the bill drew him down from
      these dreams, and left him the poorer by fifty of the francs which were to
      have gone such a long way in Paris. He could have lived in Angouleme for a
      month on the price of that dinner. Wherefore he closed the door of the
      palace with awe, thinking as he did so that he should never set foot in it
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eve was right,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he went back under the stone
      arcading for some more money. &ldquo;There is a difference between Paris prices
      and prices in L&rsquo;Houmeau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed in at the tailors&rsquo; windows on the way, and thought of the
      costumes in the Garden of the Tuileries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I will <i>not</i> appear before Mme. d&rsquo;Espard dressed
      out as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fled to his inn, fleet as a stag, rushed up to his room, took out a
      hundred crowns, and went down again to the Palais Royal, where his future
      elegance lay scattered over half a score of shops. The first tailor whose
      door he entered tried as many coats upon him as he would consent to put
      on, and persuaded his customer that all were in the very latest fashion.
      Lucien came out the owner of a green coat, a pair of white trousers, and a
      &ldquo;fancy waistcoat,&rdquo; for which outfit he gave two hundred francs. Ere long
      he found a very elegant pair of ready-made shoes that fitted his foot;
      and, finally, when he had made all necessary purchases, he ordered the
      tradespeople to send them to his address, and inquired for a hairdresser.
      At seven o&rsquo;clock that evening he called a cab and drove away to the Opera,
      curled like a Saint John of a Procession Day, elegantly waistcoated and
      gloved, but feeling a little awkward in this kind of sheath in which he
      found himself for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to Mme. de Bargeton&rsquo;s instructions, he asked for the box
      reserved for the First Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The man at the box
      office looked at him, and beholding Lucien in all the grandeur assumed for
      the occasion, in which he looked like a best man at a wedding, asked
      Lucien for his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot go in,&rdquo; said the man at the box office drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I belong to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not our business to know that,&rdquo; said the man, who could not help
      exchanging a barely perceptible smile with his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage stopped under the peristyle as he spoke. A chasseur, in a
      livery which Lucien did not recognize, let down the step, and two women in
      evening dress came out of the brougham. Lucien had no mind to lay himself
      open to an insolent order to get out of the way from the official. He
      stepped aside to let the two ladies pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that lady is the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, whom you say you know, sir,&rdquo;
       said the man ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was so much the more confounded because Mme. de Bargeton did not
      seem to recognize him in his new plumage; but when he stepped up to her,
      she smiled at him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has fallen out wonderfully&mdash;come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The functionaries at the box office grew serious again as Lucien followed
      Mme. de Bargeton. On their way up the great staircase the lady introduced
      M. de Rubempre to her cousin. The box belonging to the First Gentleman of
      the Bedchamber is situated in one of the angles at the back of the house,
      so that its occupants see and are seen all over the theatre. Lucien took
      his seat on a chair behind Mme. de Bargeton, thankful to be in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Rubempre,&rdquo; said the Marquise with flattering graciousness, &ldquo;this is
      your first visit to the Opera, is it not? You must have a view of the
      house; take this seat, sit in front of the box; we give you permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien obeyed as the first act came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made good use of your time,&rdquo; Louise said in his ear, in her
      first surprise at the change in his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise was still the same. The near presence of the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, a
      Parisian Mme. de Bargeton, was so damaging to her; the brilliancy of the
      Parisienne brought out all the defects in her country cousin so clearly by
      contrast; that Lucien, looking out over the fashionable audience in the
      superb building, and then at the great lady, was twice enlightened, and
      saw poor Anais de Negrepelisse as she really was, as Parisians saw her&mdash;a
      tall, lean, withered woman, with a pimpled face and faded complexion;
      angular, stiff, affected in her manner; pompous and provincial in her
      speech; and, and above all these things, dowdily dressed. As a matter of
      fact, the creases in an old dress from Paris still bear witness to good
      taste, you can tell what the gown was meant for; but an old dress made in
      the country is inexplicable, it is a thing to provoke laughter. There was
      neither charm nor freshness about the dress or its wearer; the velvet,
      like the complexion had seen wear. Lucien felt ashamed to have fallen in
      love with this cuttle-fish bone, and vowed that he would profit by
      Louise&rsquo;s next fit of virtue to leave her for good. Having an excellent
      view of the house, he could see the opera-glasses pointed at the
      aristocratic box par excellence. The best-dressed women must certainly be
      scrutinizing Mme. de Bargeton, for they smiled and talked among
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mme. d&rsquo;Espard knew the object of their sarcasms from those feminine
      smiles and gestures, she was perfectly insensible to them. In the first
      place, anybody must see that her companion was a poor relation from the
      country, an affliction with which any Parisian family may be visited. And,
      in the second, when her cousin had spoken to her of her dress with
      manifest misgivings, she had reassured Anais, seeing that, when once
      properly dressed, her relative would very easily acquire the tone of
      Parisian society. If Mme. de Bargeton needed polish, on the other hand she
      possessed the native haughtiness of good birth, and that indescribable
      something which may be called &ldquo;pedigree.&rdquo; So, on Monday her turn would
      come. And, moreover, the Marquise knew that as soon as people learned that
      the stranger was her cousin, they would suspend their banter and look
      twice before they condemned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien did not foresee the change in Louise&rsquo;s appearance shortly to be
      worked by a scarf about her throat, a pretty dress, an elegant coiffure,
      and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s advice. As they came up the staircase even now, the
      Marquise told her cousin not to hold her handkerchief unfolded in her
      hand. Good or bad taste turns upon hundreds of such almost imperceptible
      shades, which a quick-witted woman discerns at once, while others will
      never grasp them. Mme. de Bargeton, plentifully apt, was more than clever
      enough to discover her shortcomings. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, sure that her pupil
      would do her credit, did not decline to form her. In short, the compact
      between the two women had been confirmed by self-interest on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton, enthralled, dazzled, and fascinated by her cousin&rsquo;s
      manner, wit, and acquaintances, had suddenly declared herself a votary of
      the idol of the day. She had discerned the signs of the occult power
      exerted by the ambitious great lady, and told herself that she could gain
      her end as the satellite of this star, so she had been outspoken in her
      admiration. The Marquise was not insensible to the artlessly admitted
      conquest. She took an interest in her cousin, seeing that she was weak and
      poor; she was, besides, not indisposed to take a pupil with whom to found
      a school, and asked nothing better than to have a sort of lady-in-waiting
      in Mme. de Bargeton, a dependent who would sing her praises, a treasure
      even more scarce among Parisian women than a staunch and loyal critic
      among the literary tribe. The flutter of curiosity in the house was too
      marked to be ignored, however, and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard politely endeavored to
      turn her cousin&rsquo;s mind from the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any one comes to our box,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;perhaps we may discover the
      cause to which we owe the honor of the interest that these ladies are
      taking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a strong suspicion that it is my old velvet gown and Angoumoisin
      air which Parisian ladies find amusing,&rdquo; Mme. de Bargeton answered,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not you; it is something that I cannot explain,&rdquo; she added,
      turning to the poet, and, as she looked at him for the first time, it
      seemed to strike her that he was singularly dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is M. du Chatelet,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien at that moment, and he pointed
      a finger towards Mme. de Serizy&rsquo;s box, which the renovated beau had just
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton bit her lips with chagrin as she saw that gesture, and
      saw besides the Marquise&rsquo;s ill-suppressed smile of contemptuous
      astonishment. &ldquo;Where does the young man come from?&rdquo; her look said, and
      Louise felt humbled through her love, one of the sharpest of all pangs for
      a Frenchwoman, a mortification for which she cannot forgive her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these circles where trifles are of such importance, a gesture or a word
      at the outset is enough to ruin a newcomer. It is the principal merit of
      fine manners and the highest breeding that they produce the effect of a
      harmonious whole, in which every element is so blended that nothing is
      startling or obtrusive. Even those who break the laws of this science,
      either through ignorance or carried away by some impulse, must comprehend
      that it is with social intercourse as with music, a single discordant note
      is a complete negation of the art itself, for the harmony exists only when
      all its conditions are observed down to the least particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; asked Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, looking towards Chatelet.
      &ldquo;And have you made Mme. de Serizy&rsquo;s acquaintance already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is that the famous Mme. de Serizy who has had so many adventures and
      yet goes everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unheard-of-thing, my dear, explicable but unexplained. The most
      formidable men are her friends, and why? Nobody dares to fathom the
      mystery. Then is this person the lion of Angouleme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. le Baron du Chatelet has been a good deal talked about,&rdquo;
       answered Mme. de Bargeton, moved by vanity to give her adorer the title
      which she herself had called in question. &ldquo;He was M. de Montriveau&rsquo;s
      traveling companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, &ldquo;I never hear that name without thinking
      of the Duchesse de Langeais, poor thing. She vanished like a falling star.&mdash;That
      is M. de Rastignac with Mme. de Nucingen,&rdquo; she continued, indicating
      another box; &ldquo;she is the wife of a contractor, a banker, a city man, a
      broker on a large scale; he forced his way into society with his money,
      and they say that he is not very scrupulous as to his methods of making
      it. He is at endless pains to establish his credit as a staunch upholder
      of the Bourbons, and has tried already to gain admittance into my set.
      When his wife took Mme. de Langeais&rsquo; box, she thought that she could take
      her charm, her wit, and her success as well. It is the old fable of the
      jay in the peacock&rsquo;s feathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do M. and Mme. de Rastignac manage to keep their son in Paris, when,
      as we know, their income is under a thousand crowns?&rdquo; asked Lucien, in his
      astonishment at Rastignac&rsquo;s elegant and expensive dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to see that you come from Angouleme,&rdquo; said Mme. d&rsquo;Espard,
      ironically enough, as she continued to gaze through her opera-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her remark was lost upon Lucien; the all-absorbing spectacle of the boxes
      prevented him from thinking of anything else. He guessed that he himself
      was an object of no small curiosity. Louise, on the other hand, was
      exceedingly mortified by the evident slight esteem in which the Marquise
      held Lucien&rsquo;s beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot be so handsome as I thought him,&rdquo; she said to herself; and
      between &ldquo;not so handsome&rdquo; and &ldquo;not so clever as I thought him&rdquo; there was
      but one step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain fell. Chatelet was now paying a visit to the Duchesse de
      Carigliano in an adjourning box; Mme. de Bargeton acknowledged his bow by
      a slight inclination of the head. Nothing escapes a woman of the world;
      Chatelet&rsquo;s air of distinction was not lost upon Mme. d&rsquo;Espard. Just at
      that moment four personages, four Parisian celebrities, came into the box,
      one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most striking feature of the first comer, M. de Marsay, famous for the
      passions which he had inspired, was his girlish beauty; but its softness
      and effeminacy were counteracted by the expression of his eyes,
      unflinching, steady, untamed, and hard as a tiger&rsquo;s. He was loved and he
      was feared. Lucien was no less handsome; but Lucien&rsquo;s expression was so
      gentle, his blue eyes so limpid, that he scarcely seemed to possess the
      strength and the power which attract women so strongly. Nothing, moreover,
      so far had brought out the poet&rsquo;s merits; while de Marsay, with his flow
      of spirits, his confidence in his power to please, and appropriate style
      of dress, eclipsed every rival by his presence. Judge, therefore, the kind
      of figure that Lucien, stiff, starched, unbending in clothes as new and
      unfamiliar as his surroundings, was likely to cut in de Marsay&rsquo;s vicinity.
      De Marsay with his wit and charm of manner was privileged to be insolent.
      From Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s reception of this personage his importance was at
      once evident to Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second comer was a Vandenesse, the cause of the scandal in which Lady
      Dudley was concerned. Felix de Vandenesse, amiable, intellectual, and
      modest, had none of the characteristics on which de Marsay prided himself,
      and owed his success to diametrically opposed qualities. He had been
      warmly recommended to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard by her cousin Mme. de Mortsauf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third was General de Montriveau, the author of the Duchesse de
      Langeais&rsquo; ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth, M. de Canalis, one of the most famous poets of the day, and as
      yet a newly risen celebrity, was prouder of his birth than of his genius,
      and dangled in Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s train by way of concealing his love for the
      Duchesse de Chaulieu. In spite of his graces and the affectation that
      spoiled them, it was easy to discern the vast, lurking ambitions that
      plunged him at a later day into the storms of political life. A face that
      might be called insignificantly pretty and caressing manners thinly
      disguised the man&rsquo;s deeply-rooted egoism and habit of continually
      calculating the chances of a career which at that time looked
      problematical enough; though his choice of Mme. de Chaulieu (a woman past
      forty) made interest for him at Court, and brought him the applause of the
      Faubourg Saint-Germain and the gibes of the Liberal party, who dubbed him
      &ldquo;the poet of the sacristy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton, with these remarkable figures before her, no longer
      wondered at the slight esteem in which the Marquise held Lucien&rsquo;s good
      looks. And when conversation began, when intellects so keen, so subtle,
      were revealed in two-edged words with more meaning and depth in them than
      Anais de Bargeton heard in a month of talk at Angouleme; and, most of all,
      when Canalis uttered a sonorous phrase, summing up a materialistic epoch,
      and gilding it with poetry&mdash;then Anais felt all the truth of
      Chatelet&rsquo;s dictum of the previous evening. Lucien was nothing to her now.
      Every one cruelly ignored the unlucky stranger; he was so much like a
      foreigner listening to an unknown language, that the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard
      took pity upon him. She turned to Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to introduce M. de Rubempre,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You rank too high in
      the world of letters not to welcome a <i>debutant</i>. M. de Rubempre is
      from Angouleme, and will need your influence, no doubt, with the powers
      that bring genius to light. So far, he has no enemies to help him to
      success by their attacks upon him. Is there enough originality in the idea
      of obtaining for him by friendship all that hatred has done for you to
      tempt you to make the experiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The four newcomers all looked at Lucien while the Marquise was speaking.
      De Marsay, only a couple of paces away, put up an eyeglass and looked from
      Lucien to Mme. de Bargeton, and then again at Lucien, coupling them with
      some mocking thought, cruelly mortifying to both. He scrutinized them as
      if they had been a pair of strange animals, and then he smiled. The smile
      was like a stab to the distinguished provincial. Felix de Vandenesse
      assumed a charitable air. Montriveau looked Lucien through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; M. de Canalis answered with a bow, &ldquo;I will obey you, in spite of
      the selfish instinct which prompts us to show a rival no favor; but you
      have accustomed us to miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, do me the pleasure of dining with me on Monday with M. de
      Rubempre, and you can talk of matters literary at your ease. I will try to
      enlist some of the tyrants of the world of letters and the great people
      who protect them, the author of <i>Ourika</i>, and one or two young poets
      with sound views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; said de Marsay, &ldquo;if you give your support to this
      gentleman for his intellect, I will support him for his good looks. I will
      give him advice which will put him in a fair way to be the luckiest dandy
      in Paris. After that, he may be a poet&mdash;if he has a mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton thanked her cousin by a grateful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that you were jealous of intellect,&rdquo; Montriveau said,
      turning to de Marsay; &ldquo;good fortune is the death of a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why your lordship is thinking of marriage?&rdquo; inquired the dandy,
      addressing Canalis, and watching Mme. d&rsquo;Espard to see if the words went
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canalis shrugged his shoulders, and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, Mme. de Chaulieu&rsquo;s
      niece, began to laugh. Lucien in his new clothes felt as if he were an
      Egyptian statue in its narrow sheath; he was ashamed that he had nothing
      to say for himself all this while. At length he turned to the Marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all your kindness, madame, I am pledged to make no failures,&rdquo; he
      said in those soft tones of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatelet came in as he spoke; he had seen Montriveau, and by hook or crook
      snatched at the chance of a good introduction to the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard
      through one of the kings of Paris. He bowed to Mme. de Bargeton, and
      begged Mme. d&rsquo;Espard to pardon him for the liberty he took in invading her
      box; he had been separated so long from his traveling companion!
      Montriveau and Chatelet met for the first time since they parted in the
      desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To part in the desert, and meet again in the opera-house!&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a theatrical meeting!&rdquo; said Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montriveau introduced the Baron du Chatelet to the Marquise, and the
      Marquise received Her Royal Highness&rsquo; ex-secretary the more graciously
      because she had seen that he had been very well received in three boxes
      already. Mme. de Serizy knew none but unexceptionable people, and moreover
      he was Montriveau&rsquo;s traveling companion. So potent was this last
      credential, that Mme. de Bargeton saw from the manner of the group that
      they accepted Chatelet as one of themselves without demur. Chatelet&rsquo;s
      sultan&rsquo;s airs in Angouleme were suddenly explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Baron saw Lucien, and favored him with a cool, disparaging
      little nod, indicative to men of the world of the recipient&rsquo;s inferior
      station. A sardonic expression accompanied the greeting, &ldquo;How does <i>he</i>
      come here?&rdquo; he seemed to say. This was not lost on those who saw it; for
      de Marsay leaned towards Montriveau, and said in tones audible to
      Chatelet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ask him who the queer-looking young fellow is that looks like a dummy
      at a tailor&rsquo;s shop-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatelet spoke a few words in his traveling companion&rsquo;s ear, and while
      apparently renewing his acquaintance, no doubt cut his rival to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Lucien was surprised at the apt wit and the subtlety with which these
      gentlemen formulated their replies, he felt bewildered with epigram and
      repartee, and, most of all, by their offhand way of talking and their ease
      of manner. The material luxury of Paris had alarmed him that morning; at
      night he saw the same lavish expenditure of intellect. By what mysterious
      means, he asked himself, did these people make such piquant reflections on
      the spur of the moment, those repartees which he could only have made
      after much pondering? And not only were they at ease in their speech, they
      were at ease in their dress, nothing looked new, nothing looked old,
      nothing about them was conspicuous, everything attracted the eyes. The
      fine gentleman of to-day was the same yesterday, and would be the same
      to-morrow. Lucien guessed that he himself looked as if he were dressed for
      the first time in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said de Marsay, addressing Felix de Vandenesse, &ldquo;that
      young Rastignac is soaring away like a paper-kite. Look at him in the
      Marquise de Listomere&rsquo;s box; he is making progress, he is putting up his
      eyeglass at us! He knows this gentleman, no doubt,&rdquo; added the dandy,
      speaking to Lucien, and looking elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can scarcely fail to have heard the name of a great man of whom we are
      proud,&rdquo; said Mme. de Bargeton. &ldquo;Quite lately his sister was present when
      M. de Rubempre read us some very fine poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix de Vandenesse and de Marsay took leave of the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, and
      went off to Mme. de Listomere, Vandenesse&rsquo;s sister. The second act began,
      and the three were left to themselves again. The curious women learned how
      Mme. de Bargeton came to be there from some of the party, while the others
      announced the arrival of a poet, and made fun of his costume. Canalis went
      back to the Duchesse de Chaulieu, and no more was seen of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was glad when the rising of the curtain produced a diversion. All
      Mme. de Bargeton&rsquo;s misgivings with regard to Lucien were increased by the
      marked attention which the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard had shown to Chatelet; her
      manner towards the Baron was very different from the patronizing
      affability with which she treated Lucien. Mme. de Listomere&rsquo;s box was full
      during the second act, and, to all appearance, the talk turned upon Mme.
      de Bargeton and Lucien. Young Rastignac evidently was entertaining the
      party; he had raised the laughter that needs fresh fuel every day in
      Paris, the laughter that seizes upon a topic and exhausts it, and leaves
      it stale and threadbare in a moment. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard grew uneasy. She knew
      that an ill-natured speech is not long in coming to the ears of those whom
      it will wound, and waited till the end of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a revulsion of feeling such as had taken place in Mme. de Bargeton
      and Lucien, strange things come to pass in a brief space of time, and any
      revolution within us is controlled by laws that work with great swiftness.
      Chatelet&rsquo;s sage and politic words as to Lucien, spoken on the way home
      from the Vaudeville, were fresh in Louise&rsquo;s memory. Every phrase was a
      prophecy, it seemed as if Lucien had set himself to fulfil the predictions
      one by one. When Lucien and Mme. de Bargeton had parted with their
      illusions concerning each other, the luckless youth, with a destiny not
      unlike Rousseau&rsquo;s, went so far in his predecessor&rsquo;s footsteps that he was
      captivated by the great lady and smitten with Mme. d&rsquo;Espard at first
      sight. Young men and men who remember their young emotions can see that
      this was only what might have been looked for. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard with her
      dainty ways, her delicate enunciation, and the refined tones of her voice;
      the fragile woman so envied, of such high place and high degree, appeared
      before the poet as Mme. de Bargeton had appeared to him in Angouleme. His
      fickle nature prompted him to desire influence in that lofty sphere at
      once, and the surest way to secure such influence was to possess the woman
      who exerted it, and then everything would be his. He had succeeded at
      Angouleme, why should he not succeed in Paris?
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily, and despite the novel counter fascination of the stage, his
      eyes turned to the Celimene in her splendor; he glanced furtively at her
      every moment; the longer he looked, the more he desired to look at her.
      Mme. de Bargeton caught the gleam in Lucien&rsquo;s eyes, and saw that he found
      the Marquise more interesting than the opera. If Lucien had forsaken her
      for the fifty daughters of Danaus, she could have borne his desertion with
      equanimity; but another glance&mdash;bolder, more ardent and unmistakable
      than any before&mdash;revealed the state of Lucien&rsquo;s feelings. She grew
      jealous, but not so much for the future as for the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never gave me such a look,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Dear me! Chatelet was
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw that she had made a mistake; and when a woman once begins to
      repent of her weaknesses, she sponges out the whole past. Every one of
      Lucien&rsquo;s glances roused her indignation, but to all outward appearance she
      was calm. De Marsay came back in the interval, bringing M. de Listomere
      with him; and that serious person and the young coxcomb soon informed the
      Marquise that the wedding guest in his holiday suit, whom she had the bad
      luck to have in her box, had as much right to the appellation of Rubempre
      as a Jew to a baptismal name. Lucien&rsquo;s father was an apothecary named
      Chardon. M. de Rastignac, who knew all about Angouleme, had set several
      boxes laughing already at the mummy whom the Marquise styled her cousin,
      and at the Marquise&rsquo;s forethought in having an apothecary at hand to
      sustain an artificial life with drugs. In short, de Marsay brought a
      selection from the thousand-and-one jokes made by Parisians on the spur of
      the moment, and no sooner uttered than forgotten. Chatelet was at the back
      of it all, and the real author of this Punic faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard turned to Mme. de Bargeton, put up her fan, and said, &ldquo;My
      dear, tell me if your protege&rsquo;s name is really M. de Rubempre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has assumed his mother&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Anais, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s name was Chardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was this Chardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A druggist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, I felt quite sure that all Paris could not be laughing at
      any one whom I took up. I do not care to stay here when wags come in in
      high glee because there is an apothecary&rsquo;s son in my box. If you will
      follow my advice, we will leave it, and at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s expression was insolent enough; Lucien was at a loss to
      account for her change of countenance. He thought that his waistcoat was
      in bad taste, which was true; and that his coat looked like a caricature
      of the fashion, which was likewise true. He discerned, in bitterness of
      soul, that he must put himself in the hands of an expert tailor, and vowed
      that he would go the very next morning to the most celebrated artist in
      Paris. On Monday he would hold his own with the men in the Marquise&rsquo;s
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, lost in thought though he was, he saw the third act to an end, and,
      with his eyes fixed on the gorgeous scene upon the stage, dreamed out his
      dream of Mme. d&rsquo;Espard. He was in despair over her sudden coldness; it
      gave a strange check to the ardent reasoning through which he advanced
      upon this new love, undismayed by the immense difficulties in the way,
      difficulties which he saw and resolved to conquer. He roused himself from
      these deep musings to look once more at his new idol, turned his head, and
      saw that he was alone; he had heard a faint rustling sound, the door
      closed&mdash;Madame d&rsquo;Espard had taken her cousin with her. Lucien was
      surprised to the last degree by the sudden desertion; he did not think
      long about it, however, simply because it was inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage was rolling along the Rue de Richelieu on the way to the
      Faubourg Saint-Honore, the Marquise spoke to her cousin in a tone of
      suppressed irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, what are you thinking about? Pray wait till an
      apothecary&rsquo;s son has made a name for himself before you trouble yourself
      about him. The Duchesse de Chaulieu does not acknowledge Canalis even now,
      and he is famous and a man of good family. This young fellow is neither
      your son nor your lover, I suppose?&rdquo; added the haughty dame, with a keen,
      inquisitive glance at her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fortunate for me that I kept the little scapegrace at a distance!&rdquo;
       thought Madame de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued the Marquise, taking the expression in her cousin&rsquo;s
      eyes for an answer, &ldquo;drop him, I beg of you. Taking an illustrious name in
      that way!&mdash;Why, it is a piece of impudence that will meet with its
      desserts in society. It is his mother&rsquo;s name, I dare say; but just
      remember, dear, that the King alone can confer, by a special ordinance,
      the title of de Rubempre on the son of a daughter of the house. If she
      made a <i>mesalliance</i>, the favor would be enormous, only to be granted
      to vast wealth, or conspicuous services, or very powerful influence. The
      young man looks like a shopman in his Sunday suit; evidently he is neither
      wealthy nor noble; he has a fine head, but he seems to me to be very
      silly; he has no idea what to do, and has nothing to say for himself; in
      fact, he has no breeding. How came you to take him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton renounced Lucien as Lucien himself had renounced her; a
      ghastly fear lest her cousin should learn the manner of her journey shot
      through her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear cousin, I am in despair that I have compromised you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People do not compromise me,&rdquo; Mme. d&rsquo;Espard said, smiling; &ldquo;I am only
      thinking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have asked him to dine with you on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be ill,&rdquo; the Marquise said quickly; &ldquo;you can tell him so, and I
      shall leave orders that he is not to be admitted under either name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the interval Lucien noticed that every one was walking up and down
      the lobby. He would do the same. In the first place, not one of Mme.
      d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s visitors recognized him nor paid any attention to him, their
      conduct seemed nothing less than extraordinary to the provincial poet;
      and, secondly, Chatelet, on whom he tried to hang, watched him out of the
      corner of his eye and fought shy of him. Lucien walked to and fro,
      watching the eddying crowd of men, till he felt convinced that his costume
      was absurd, and he went back to his box, ensconced himself in a corner,
      and stayed there till the end. At times he thought of nothing but the
      magnificent spectacle of the ballet in the great Inferno scene in the
      fifth act; sometimes the sight of the house absorbed him, sometimes his
      own thoughts; he had seen society in Paris, and the sight had stirred him
      to the depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is my kingdom,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;this is the world that I
      must conquer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he walked home through the streets he thought over all that had been
      said by Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s courtiers; memory reproducing with strange
      faithfulness their demeanor, their gestures, their manner of coming and
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, towards noon, Lucien betook himself to Staub, the great tailor
      of that day. Partly by dint of entreaties, and partly by virtue of cash,
      Lucien succeeded in obtaining a promise that his clothes should be ready
      in time for the great day. Staub went so far as to give his word that a
      perfectly elegant coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of trousers should be
      forthcoming. Lucien then ordered linen and pocket-handkerchiefs, a little
      outfit, in short, of a linen-draper, and a celebrated bootmaker measured
      him for shoes and boots. He bought a neat walking cane at Verdier&rsquo;s; he
      went to Mme. Irlande for gloves and shirt studs; in short, he did his best
      to reach the climax of dandyism. When he had satisfied all his fancies, he
      went to the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg, and found that Louise had gone out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was dining with Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Espard,&rdquo; her maid said, &ldquo;and would
      not be back till late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien dined for two francs at a restaurant in the Palais Royal, and went
      to bed early. The next day was Sunday. He went to Louise&rsquo;s lodging at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock. Louise had not yet risen. At two o&rsquo;clock he returned once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame cannot see anybody yet,&rdquo; reported Albertine, &ldquo;but she gave me a
      line for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot see anybody yet?&rdquo; repeated Lucien. &ldquo;But I am not anybody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Albertine answered very impertinently; and Lucien, less
      surprised by Albertine&rsquo;s answer than by a note from Mme. de Bargeton, took
      the billet, and read the following discouraging lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. d&rsquo;Espard is not well; she will not be able to see you on Monday. I
      am not feeling very well myself, but I am about to dress and go to keep
      her company. I am in despair over this little disappointment; but your
      talents reassure me, you will make your way without charlatanism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no signature!&rdquo; Lucien said to himself. He found himself in the
      Tuileries before he knew whither he was walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the gift of second-sight which accompanies genius, he began to
      suspect that the chilly note was but a warning of the catastrophe to come.
      Lost in thought, he walked on and on, gazing at the monuments in the Place
      Louis Quinze.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sunny day; a stream of fine carriages went past him on the way to
      the Champs Elysees. Following the direction of the crowd of strollers, he
      saw the three or four thousand carriages that turn the Champs Elysees into
      an improvised Longchamp on Sunday afternoons in summer. The splendid
      horses, the toilettes, and liveries bewildered him; he went further and
      further, until he reached the Arc de Triomphe, then unfinished. What were
      his feelings when, as he returned, he saw Mme. de Bargeton and Mme.
      d&rsquo;Espard coming towards him in a wonderfully appointed caleche, with a
      chasseur behind it in waving plumes and that gold-embroidered green
      uniform which he knew only too well. There was a block somewhere in the
      row, and the carriages waited. Lucien beheld Louise transformed beyond
      recognition. All the colors of her toilette had been carefully
      subordinated to her complexion; her dress was delicious, her hair
      gracefully and becomingly arranged, her hat, in exquisite taste, was
      remarkable even beside Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, that leader of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something in the art of wearing a hat that escapes definition.
      Tilted too far to the back of the head, it imparts a bold expression to
      the face; bring it too far forward, it gives you a sinister look; tipped
      to one side, it has a jaunty air; a well-dressed woman wears her hat
      exactly as she means to wear it, and exactly at the right angle. Mme. de
      Bargeton had solved this curious problem at sight. A dainty girdle
      outlined her slender waist. She had adopted her cousin&rsquo;s gestures and
      tricks of manner; and now, as she sat by Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s side, she played
      with a tiny scent bottle that dangled by a slender gold chain from one of
      her fingers, displayed a little well-gloved hand without seeming to do so.
      She had modeled herself on Mme. d&rsquo;Espard without mimicking her; the
      Marquise had found a cousin worthy of her, and seemed to be proud of her
      pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men and women on the footways all gazed at the splendid carriage, with
      the bearings of the d&rsquo;Espards and Blamont-Chauvrys upon the panels. Lucien
      was amazed at the number of greetings received by the cousins; he did not
      know that the &ldquo;all Paris,&rdquo; which consists in some score of salons, was
      well aware already of the relationship between the ladies. A little group
      of young men on horseback accompanied the carriage in the Bois; Lucien
      could recognize de Marsay and Rastignac among them, and could see from
      their gestures that the pair of coxcombs were complimenting Mme. de
      Bargeton upon her transformation. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard was radiant with health
      and grace. So her indisposition was simply a pretext for ridding herself
      of him, for there had been no mention of another day!
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrathful poet went towards the caleche; he walked slowly, waited till
      he came in full sight of the two ladies, and made them a bow. Mme. de
      Bargeton would not see him; but the Marquise put up her eyeglass, and
      deliberately cut him. He had been disowned by the sovereign lords of
      Angouleme, but to be disowned by society in Paris was another thing; the
      booby-squires by doing their utmost to mortify Lucien admitted his power
      and acknowledged him as a man; for Mme. d&rsquo;Espard he had positively no
      existence. This was a sentence, it was a refusal of justice. Poor poet! a
      deadly cold seized on him when he saw de Marsay eying him through his
      glass; and when the Parisian lion let that optical instrument fall, it
      dropped in so singular a fashion that Lucien thought of the knife-blade of
      the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caleche went by. Rage and a craving for vengeance took possession of
      his slighted soul. If Mme. de Bargeton had been in his power, he could
      have cut her throat at that moment; he was a Fouquier-Tinville gloating
      over the pleasure of sending Mme. d&rsquo;Espard to the scaffold. If only he
      could have put de Marsay to the torture with refinements of savage
      cruelty! Canalis went by on horseback, bowing to the prettiest women, his
      dress elegant, as became the most dainty of poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien. &ldquo;Money, money at all costs! money is
      the one power before which the world bends the knee.&rdquo; (&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried
      conscience, &ldquo;not money, but glory; and glory means work! Work! that was
      what David said.&rdquo;) &ldquo;Great heavens! what am I doing here? But I will
      triumph. I will drive along this avenue in a caleche with a chasseur
      behind me! I will possess a Marquise d&rsquo;Espard.&rdquo; And flinging out the
      wrathful words, he went to Hurbain&rsquo;s to dine for two francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, at nine o&rsquo;clock, he went to the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg to
      upbraid Louise for her barbarity. But Mme. de Bargeton was not at home to
      him, and not only so, but the porter would not allow him to go up to her
      rooms; so he stayed outside in the street, watching the house till noon.
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock Chatelet came out, looked at Lucien out of the corner of
      his eye, and avoided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stung to the quick, Lucien hurried after his rival; and Chatelet, finding
      himself closely pursued, turned and bowed, evidently intending to shake
      him off by this courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me just a moment for pity&rsquo;s sake, sir,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;I want just a
      word or two with you. You have shown me friendship, I now ask the most
      trifling service of that friendship. You have just come from Mme. de
      Bargeton; how have I fallen into disgrace with her and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard?&mdash;please
      explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Chardon, do you know why the ladies left you at the Opera that
      evening?&rdquo; asked Chatelet, with treacherous good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the poor poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was M. de Rastignac who spoke against you from the beginning.
      They asked him about you, and the young dandy simply said that your name
      was Chardon, and not de Rubempre; that your mother was a monthly nurse;
      that your father, when he was alive, was an apothecary in L&rsquo;Houmeau, a
      suburb of Angouleme; and that your sister, a charming girl, gets up shirts
      to admiration, and is just about to be married to a local printer named
      Sechard. Such is the world! You no sooner show yourself than it pulls you
      to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Marsay came to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard to laugh at you with her; so the two
      ladies, thinking that your presence put them in a false position, went out
      at once. Do not attempt to go to either house. If Mme. de Bargeton
      continued to receive your visits, her cousin would have nothing to do with
      her. You have genius; try to avenge yourself. The world looks down upon
      you; look down in your turn upon the world. Take refuge in some garret,
      write your masterpieces, seize on power of any kind, and you will see the
      world at your feet. Then you can give back the bruises which you have
      received, and in the very place where they were given. Mme. de Bargeton
      will be the more distant now because she has been friendly. That is the
      way with women. But the question now for you is not how to win back Anais&rsquo; 
      friendship, but how to avoid making an enemy of her. I will tell you of a
      way. She has written letters to you; send all her letters back to her, she
      will be sensible that you are acting like a gentleman; and at a later
      time, if you should need her, she will not be hostile. For my own part, I
      have so high an opinion of your future, that I have taken your part
      everywhere; and if I can do anything here for you, you will always find me
      ready to be of use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elderly beau seemed to have grown young again in the atmosphere of
      Paris. He bowed with frigid politeness; but Lucien, woe-begone, haggard,
      and undone, forgot to return the salutation. He went back to his inn, and
      there found the great Staub himself, come in person, not so much to try
      his customer&rsquo;s clothes as to make inquiries of the landlady with regard to
      that customer&rsquo;s financial status. The report had been satisfactory. Lucien
      had traveled post; Mme. de Bargeton brought him back from Vaudeville last
      Thursday in her carriage. Staub addressed Lucien as &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo;
       and called his customer&rsquo;s attention to the artistic skill with which he
      had brought a charming figure into relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man in such a costume has only to walk in the Tuileries,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and he will marry an English heiress within a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien brightened a little under the influences of the German tailor&rsquo;s
      joke, the perfect fit of his new clothes, the fine cloth, and the sight of
      a graceful figure which met his eyes in the looking-glass. Vaguely he told
      himself that Paris was the capital of chance, and for the moment he
      believed in chance. Had he not a volume of poems and a magnificent romance
      entitled <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i> in manuscript? He had hope for
      the future. Staub promised the overcoat and the rest of the clothes the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the bootmaker, linen-draper, and tailor all returned armed
      each with his bill, which Lucien, still under the charm of provincial
      habits, paid forthwith, not knowing how otherwise to rid himself of them.
      After he had paid, there remained but three hundred and sixty francs out
      of the two thousand which he had brought with him from Angouleme, and he
      had been but one week in Paris! Nevertheless, he dressed and went to take
      a stroll in the Terrassee des Feuillants. He had his day of triumph. He
      looked so handsome and so graceful, he was so well dressed, that women
      looked at him; two or three were so much struck with his beauty, that they
      turned their heads to look again. Lucien studied the gait and carriage of
      the young men on the Terrasse, and took a lesson in fine manners while he
      meditated on his three hundred and sixty francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, alone in his chamber, an idea occurred to him which threw a
      light on the problem of his existence at the Gaillard-Bois, where he lived
      on the plainest fare, thinking to economize in this way. He asked for his
      account, as if he meant to leave, and discovered that he was indebted to
      his landlord to the extent of a hundred francs. The next morning was spent
      in running around the Latin Quarter, recommended for its cheapness by
      David. For a long while he looked about till, finally, in the Rue de
      Cluny, close to the Sorbonne, he discovered a place where he could have a
      furnished room for such a price as he could afford to pay. He settled with
      his hostess of the Gaillard-Bois, and took up his quarters in the Rue de
      Cluny that same day. His removal only cost him the cab fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken possession of his poor room, he made a packet of Mme. de
      Bargeton&rsquo;s letters, laid them on the table, and sat down to write to her;
      but before he wrote he fell to thinking over that fatal week. He did not
      tell himself that he had been the first to be faithless; that for a sudden
      fancy he had been ready to leave his Louise without knowing what would
      become of her in Paris. He saw none of his own shortcomings, but he saw
      his present position, and blamed Mme. de Bargeton for it. She was to have
      lighted his way; instead she had ruined him. He grew indignant, he grew
      proud, he worked himself into a paroxysm of rage, and set himself to
      compose the following epistle:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What would you think, madame, of a woman who should take a fancy
  to some poor and timid child full of the noble superstitions which
  the grown man calls &lsquo;illusions;&rsquo; and using all the charms of
  woman&rsquo;s coquetry, all her most delicate ingenuity, should feign a
  mother&rsquo;s love to lead that child astray? Her fondest promises, the
  card-castles which raised his wonder, cost her nothing; she leads
  him on, tightens her hold upon him, sometimes coaxing, sometimes
  scolding him for his want of confidence, till the child leaves his
  home and follows her blindly to the shores of a vast sea. Smiling,
  she lures him into a frail skiff, and sends him forth alone and
  helpless to face the storm. Standing safe on the rock, she laughs
  and wishes him luck. You are that woman; I am that child.

  &ldquo;The child has a keepsake in his hands, something which might
  betray the wrongs done by your beneficence, your kindness in
  deserting him. You might have to blush if you saw him struggling
  for life, and chanced to recollect that once you clasped him to
  your breast. When you read these words the keepsake will be in
  your own safe keeping; you are free to forget everything.

  &ldquo;Once you pointed out fair hopes to me in the skies, I awake to
  find reality in the squalid poverty of Paris. While you pass, and
  others bow before you, on your brilliant path in the great world,
  I, I whom you deserted on the threshold, shall be shivering in the
  wretched garret to which you consigned me. Yet some pang may
  perhaps trouble your mind amid festivals and pleasures; you may
  think sometimes of the child whom you thrust into the depths. If
  so, madame, think of him without remorse. Out of the depths of his
  misery the child offers you the one thing left to him&mdash;his
  forgiveness in a last look. Yes, madame, thanks to you, I have
  nothing left. Nothing! was not the world created from nothing?
  Genius should follow the Divine example; I begin with God-like
  forgiveness, but as yet I know not whether I possess the God-like
  power. You need only tremble lest I should go astray; for you
  would be answerable for my sins. Alas! I pity you, for you will
  have no part in the future towards which I go, with work as my
  guide.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After penning this rhetorical effusion, full of the sombre dignity which
      an artist of one-and-twenty is rather apt to overdo, Lucien&rsquo;s thoughts
      went back to them at home. He saw the pretty rooms which David had
      furnished for him, at the cost of part of his little store, and a vision
      rose before him of quiet, simple pleasures in the past. Shadowy figures
      came about him; he saw his mother and Eve and David, and heard their sobs
      over his leave-taking, and at that he began to cry himself, for he felt
      very lonely in Paris, and friendless and forlorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days later he wrote to his sister:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;MY DEAR EVE,&mdash;When a sister shares the life of a brother who
  devotes himself to art, it is her sad privilege to take more
  sorrow than joy into her life; and I am beginning to fear that I
  shall be a great trouble to you. Have I not abused your goodness
  already? have not all of you sacrificed yourselves to me? It is
  the memory of the past, so full of family happiness, that helps me
  to bear up in my present loneliness. Now that I have tasted the
  first beginnings of poverty and the treachery of the world of
  Paris, how my thoughts have flown to you, swift as an eagle back
  to its eyrie, so that I might be with true affection again. Did
  you see sparks in the candle? Did a coal pop out of the fire? Did
  you hear singing in your ears? And did mother say, &lsquo;Lucien is
  thinking of us,&rsquo; and David answer, &lsquo;He is fighting his way in the
  world?&rsquo; 

  &ldquo;My Eve, I am writing this letter for your eyes only. I cannot
  tell any one else all that has happened to me, good and bad,
  blushing for both, as I write, for good here is as rare as evil
  ought to be. You shall have a great piece of news in a very few
  words. Mme. de Bargeton was ashamed of me, disowned me, would not
  see me, and gave me up nine days after we came to Paris. She saw
  me in the street and looked another way; when, simply to follow
  her into the society to which she meant to introduce me, I had
  spent seventeen hundred and sixty francs out of the two thousand I
  brought from Angouleme, the money so hardly scraped together. &lsquo;How
  did you spend it?&rsquo; you will ask. Paris is a strange bottomless
  gulf, my poor sister; you can dine here for less than a franc, yet
  the simplest dinner at a fashionable restaurant costs fifty
  francs; there are waistcoats and trousers to be had for four
  francs and two francs each; but a fashionable tailor never charges
  less than a hundred francs. You pay for everything; you pay a
  halfpenny to cross the kennel in the street when it rains; you
  cannot go the least little way in a cab for less than thirty-two
  sous.

  &ldquo;I have been staying in one of the best parts of Paris, but now I
  am living at the Hotel de Cluny, in the Rue de Cluny, one of the
  poorest and darkest slums, shut in between three churches and the
  old buildings of the Sorbonne. I have a furnished room on the
  fourth floor; it is very bare and very dirty, but, all the same, I
  pay fifteen francs a month for it. For breakfast I spend a penny
  on a roll and a halfpenny for milk, but I dine very decently for
  twenty-two sous at a restaurant kept by a man named Flicoteaux in
  the Place de la Sorbonne itself. My expenses every month will not
  exceed sixty francs, everything included, until the winter begins
  &mdash;at least I hope not. So my two hundred and forty francs ought to
  last me for the first four months. Between now and then I shall
  have sold <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i> and the <i>Marguerites</i> no doubt.
  Do not be in the least uneasy on my account. If the present is
  cold and bare and poverty-stricken, the blue distant future is
  rich and splendid; most great men have known the vicissitudes
  which depress but cannot overwhelm me.

  &ldquo;Plautus, the great comic Latin poet, was once a miller&rsquo;s lad.
  Machiavelli wrote <i>The Prince</i> at night, and by day was a common
  working-man like any one else; and more than all, the great
  Cervantes, who lost an arm at the battle of Lepanto, and helped to
  win that famous day, was called a &lsquo;base-born, handless dotard&rsquo; by
  the scribblers of his day; there was an interval of ten years
  between the appearance of the first part and the second of his
  sublime <i>Don Quixote</i> for lack of a publisher. Things are not so bad
  as that nowadays. Mortifications and want only fall to the lot of
  unknown writers; as soon as a man&rsquo;s name is known, he grows rich,
  and I will be rich. And besides, I live within myself, I spend
  half the day at the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve, learning all
  that I want to learn; I should not go far unless I knew more than
  I do. So at this moment I am almost happy. In a few days I have
  fallen in with my life very gladly. I begin the work that I love
  with daylight, my subsistence is secure, I think a great deal, and
  I study. I do not see that I am open to attack at any point, now
  that I have renounced a world where my vanity might suffer at any
  moment. The great men of every age are obliged to lead lives
  apart. What are they but birds in the forest? They sing, nature
  falls under the spell of their song, and no one should see them.
  That shall be my lot, always supposing that I can carry out my
  ambitious plans.

  &ldquo;Mme. de Bargeton I do not regret. A woman who could behave as she
  behaved does not deserve a thought. Nor am I sorry that I left
  Angouleme. She did wisely when she flung me into the sea of Paris
  to sink or swim. This is the place for men of letters and thinkers
  and poets; here you cultivate glory, and I know how fair the
  harvest is that we reap in these days. Nowhere else can a writer
  find the living works of the great dead, the works of art which
  quicken the imagination in the galleries and museums here; nowhere
  else will you find great reference libraries always open in which
  the intellect may find pasture. And lastly, here in Paris there is
  a spirit which you breathe in the air; it infuses the least
  details, every literary creation bears traces of its influence.
  You learn more by talk in a cafe, or at a theatre, in one half
  hour, than you would learn in ten years in the provinces. Here, in
  truth, wherever you go, there is always something to see,
  something to learn, some comparison to make. Extreme cheapness and
  excessive dearness&mdash;there is Paris for you; there is honeycomb
  here for every bee, every nature finds its own nourishment. So,
  though life is hard for me just now, I repent of nothing. On the
  contrary, a fair future spreads out before me, and my heart
  rejoices though it is saddened for the moment. Good-bye my dear
  sister. Do not expect letters from me regularly; it is one of the
  peculiarities of Paris that one really does not know how the time
  goes. Life is so alarmingly rapid. I kiss the mother and you and
  David more tenderly than ever.
</pre>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;LUCIEN.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The name of Flicoteaux is engraved on many memories. Few indeed were the
      students who lived in the Latin Quarter during the last twelve years of
      the Restoration and did not frequent that temple sacred to hunger and
      impecuniosity. There a dinner of three courses, with a quarter bottle of
      wine or a bottle of beer, could be had for eighteen sous; or for
      twenty-two sous the quarter bottle becomes a bottle. Flicoteaux, that
      friend of youth, would beyond a doubt have amassed a colossal fortune but
      for a line on his bill of fare, a line which rival establishments are wont
      to print in capital letters, thus&mdash;BREAD AT DISCRETION, which, being
      interpreted, should read &ldquo;indiscretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flicoteaux has been nursing-father to many an illustrious name. Verily,
      the heart of more than one great man ought to wax warm with innumerable
      recollections of inexpressible enjoyment at the sight of the small, square
      window panes that look upon the Place de la Sorbonne, and the Rue
      Neuve-de-Richelieu. Flicoteaux II. and Flicoteaux III. respected the old
      exterior, maintaining the dingy hue and general air of a respectable,
      old-established house, showing thereby the depth of their contempt for the
      charlatanism of the shop-front, the kind of advertisement which feasts the
      eyes at the expense of the stomach, to which your modern restaurant almost
      always has recourse. Here you beheld no piles of straw-stuffed game never
      destined to make the acquaintance of the spit, no fantastical fish to
      justify the mountebank&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;I saw a fine carp to-day; I expect to
      buy it this day week.&rdquo; Instead of the prime vegetables more fittingly
      described by the word primeval, artfully displayed in the window for the
      delectation of the military man and his fellow country-woman the
      nursemaid, honest Flicoteaux exhibited full salad-bowls adorned with many
      a rivet, or pyramids of stewed prunes to rejoice the sight of the
      customer, and assure him that the word &ldquo;dessert,&rdquo; with which other
      handbills made too free, was in this case no charter to hoodwink the
      public. Loaves of six pounds&rsquo; weight, cut in four quarters, made good the
      promise of &ldquo;bread at discretion.&rdquo; Such was the plenty of the
      establishment, that Moliere would have celebrated it if it had been in
      existence in his day, so comically appropriate is the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flicoteaux still subsists; so long as students are minded to live,
      Flicoteaux will make a living. You feed there, neither more nor less; and
      you feed as you work, with morose or cheerful industry, according to the
      circumstances and the temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time his well-known establishment consisted of two dining-halls,
      at right angles to each other; long, narrow, low-ceiled rooms, looking
      respectively on the Rue Neuve-de-Richelieu and the Place de la Sorbonne.
      The furniture must have come originally from the refectory of some abbey,
      for there was a monastic look about the lengthy tables, where the
      serviettes of regular customers, each thrust through a numbered ring of
      crystallized tin plate, were laid by their places. Flicoteaux I. only
      changed the serviettes of a Sunday; but Flicoteaux II. changed them twice
      a week, it is said, under pressure of competition which threatened his
      dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s restaurant is no banqueting-hall, with its refinements and
      luxuries; it is a workshop where suitable tools are provided, and
      everybody gets up and goes as soon as he has finished. The coming and
      going within are swift. There is no dawdling among the waiters; they are
      all busy; every one of them is wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fare is not very varied. The potato is a permanent institution; there
      might not be a single tuber left in Ireland, and prevailing dearth
      elsewhere, but you would still find potatoes at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s. Not once in
      thirty years shall you miss its pale gold (the color beloved of Titian),
      sprinkled with chopped verdure; the potato enjoys a privilege that women
      might envy; such as you see it in 1814, so shall you find it in 1840.
      Mutton cutlets and fillet of beef at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s represent black game and
      fillet of sturgeon at Very&rsquo;s; they are not on the regular bill of fare,
      that is, and must be ordered beforehand. Beef of the feminine gender there
      prevails; the young of the bovine species appears in all kinds of
      ingenious disguises. When the whiting and mackerel abound on our shores,
      they are likewise seen in large numbers at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s; his whole
      establishment, indeed, is directly affected by the caprices of the season
      and the vicissitudes of French agriculture. By eating your dinners at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s you learn a host of things of which the wealthy, the idle,
      and folk indifferent to the phases of Nature have no suspicion, and the
      student penned up in the Latin Quarter is kept accurately informed of the
      state of the weather and good or bad seasons. He knows when it is a good
      year for peas or French beans, and the kind of salad stuff that is
      plentiful; when the Great Market is glutted with cabbages, he is at once
      aware of the fact, and the failure of the beetroot crop is brought home to
      his mind. A slander, old in circulation in Lucien&rsquo;s time, connected the
      appearance of beef-steaks with a mortality among horseflesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few Parisian restaurants are so well worth seeing. Every one at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s is young; you see nothing but youth; and although earnest
      faces and grave, gloomy, anxious faces are not lacking, you see hope and
      confidence and poverty gaily endured. Dress, as a rule, is careless, and
      regular comers in decent clothes are marked exceptions. Everybody knows at
      once that something extraordinary is afoot: a mistress to visit, a theatre
      party, or some excursion into higher spheres. Here, it is said,
      friendships have been made among students who became famous men in after
      days, as will be seen in the course of this narrative; but with the
      exception of a few knots of young fellows from the same part of France who
      make a group about the end of a table, the gravity of the diners is hardly
      relaxed. Perhaps this gravity is due to the catholicity of the wine, which
      checks good fellowship of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s frequenters may recollect certain sombre and mysterious
      figures enveloped in the gloom of the chilliest penury; these beings would
      dine there daily for a couple of years and then vanish, and the most
      inquisitive regular comer could throw no light on the disappearance of
      such goblins of Paris. Friendships struck up over Flicoteaux&rsquo;s dinners
      were sealed in neighboring cafes in the flames of heady punch, or by the
      generous warmth of a small cup of black coffee glorified by a dash of
      something hotter and stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, like all neophytes, was modest and regular in his habits in those
      early days at the Hotel de Cluny. After the first unlucky venture in
      fashionable life which absorbed his capital, he threw himself into his
      work with the first earnest enthusiasm, which is frittered away so soon
      over the difficulties or in the by-paths of every life in Paris. The most
      luxurious and the very poorest lives are equally beset with temptations
      which nothing but the fierce energy of genius or the morose persistence of
      ambition can overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien used to drop in at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s about half-past four, having
      remarked the advantages of an early arrival; the bill-of-fare was more
      varied, and there was still some chance of obtaining the dish of your
      choice. Like all imaginative persons, he had taken a fancy to a particular
      seat, and showed discrimination in his selection. On the very first day he
      had noticed a table near the counter, and from the faces of those who sat
      about it, and chance snatches of their talk, he recognized brothers of the
      craft. A sort of instinct, moreover, pointed out the table near the
      counter as a spot whence he could parlay with the owners of the
      restaurant. In time an acquaintance would grow up, he thought, and then in
      the day of distress he could no doubt obtain the necessary credit. So he
      took his place at a small square table close to the desk, intended
      probably for casual comers, for the two clean serviettes were unadorned
      with rings. Lucien&rsquo;s opposite neighbor was a thin, pallid youth, to all
      appearance as poor as himself; his handsome face was somewhat worn,
      already it told of hopes that had vanished, leaving lines upon his
      forehead and barren furrows in his soul, where seeds had been sown that
      had come to nothing. Lucien felt drawn to the stranger by these tokens;
      his sympathies went out to him with irresistible fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a week&rsquo;s exchange of small courtesies and remarks, the poet from
      Angouleme found the first person with whom he could chat. The stranger&rsquo;s
      name was Etienne Lousteau. Two years ago he had left his native place, a
      town in Berri, just as Lucien had come from Angouleme. His lively
      gestures, bright eyes, and occasionally curt speech revealed a bitter
      apprenticeship to literature. Etienne had come from Sancerre with his
      tragedy in his pocket, drawn to Paris by the same motives that impelled
      Lucien&mdash;hope of fame and power and money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Etienne Lousteau came for several days together; but in a little
      while his visits became few and far between, and he would stay away for
      five or six days in succession. Then he would come back, and Lucien would
      hope to see his poet next day, only to find a stranger in his place. When
      two young men meet daily, their talk harks back to their last
      conversation; but these continual interruptions obliged Lucien to break
      the ice afresh each time, and further checked an intimacy which made
      little progress during the first few weeks. On inquiry of the damsel at
      the counter, Lucien was told that his future friend was on the staff of a
      small newspaper, and wrote reviews of books and dramatic criticism of
      pieces played at the Ambigu-Comique, the Gaite, and the
      Panorama-Dramatique. The young man became a personage all at once in
      Lucien&rsquo;s eyes. Now, he thought, he would lead the conversation on rather
      more personal topics, and make some effort to gain a friend so likely to
      be useful to a beginner. The journalist stayed away for a fortnight.
      Lucien did not know that Etienne only dined at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s when he was
      hard up, and hence his gloomy air of disenchantment and the chilly manner,
      which Lucien met with gracious smiles and amiable remarks. But, after all,
      the project of a friendship called for mature deliberation. This obscure
      journalist appeared to lead an expensive life in which <i>petits verres</i>,
      cups of coffee, punch-bowls, sight-seeing, and suppers played a part. In
      the early days of Lucien&rsquo;s life in the Latin Quarter, he behaved like a
      poor child bewildered by his first experience of Paris life; so that when
      he had made a study of prices and weighed his purse, he lacked courage to
      make advances to Etienne; he was afraid of beginning a fresh series of
      blunders of which he was still repenting. And he was still under the yoke
      of provincial creeds; his two guardian angels, Eve and David, rose up
      before him at the least approach of an evil thought, putting him in mind
      of all the hopes that were centered on him, of the happiness that he owed
      to the old mother, of all the promises of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent his mornings in studying history at the Bibliotheque
      Sainte-Genevieve. His very first researches made him aware of frightful
      errors in the memoirs of <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i> When the library
      closed, he went back to his damp, chilly room to correct his work, cutting
      out whole chapters and piecing it together anew. And after dining at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s, he went down to the Passage du Commerce to see the
      newspapers at Blosse&rsquo;s reading-room, as well as new books and magazines
      and poetry, so as to keep himself informed of the movements of the day.
      And when, towards midnight, he returned to his wretched lodgings, he had
      used neither fuel nor candle-light. His reading in those days made such an
      enormous change in his ideas, that he revised the volume of
      flower-sonnets, his beloved <i>Marguerites</i>, working them over to such
      purpose, that scarce a hundred lines of the original verses were allowed
      to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in the beginning Lucien led the honest, innocent life of the country
      lad who never leaves the Latin Quarter; devoting himself wholly to his
      work, with thoughts of the future always before him; who finds
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s ordinary luxurious after the simple home-fare; and strolls
      for recreation along the alleys of the Luxembourg, the blood surging back
      to his heart as he gives timid side glances to the pretty women. But this
      could not last. Lucien, with his poetic temperament and boundless
      longings, could not withstand the temptations held out by the play-bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Theatre-Francais, the Vaudeville, the Varietes, the Opera-Comique
      relieved him of some sixty francs, although he always went to the pit.
      What student could deny himself the pleasure of seeing Talma in one of his
      famous roles? Lucien was fascinated by the theatre, that first love of all
      poetic temperaments; the actors and actresses were awe-inspiring
      creatures; he did not so much as dream of the possibility of crossing the
      footlights and meeting them on familiar terms. The men and women who gave
      him so much pleasure were surely marvelous beings, whom the newspapers
      treated with as much gravity as matters of national interest. To be a
      dramatic author, to have a play produced on the stage! What a dream was
      this to cherish! A dream which a few bold spirits like Casimir Delavigne
      had actually realized. Thick swarming thoughts like these, and moments of
      belief in himself, followed by despair gave Lucien no rest, and kept him
      in the narrow way of toil and frugality, in spite of the smothered
      grumblings of more than one frenzied desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying prudence to an extreme, he made it a rule never to enter the
      precincts of the Palais Royal, that place of perdition where he had spent
      fifty francs at Very&rsquo;s in a single day, and nearly five hundred francs on
      his clothes; and when he yielded to temptation, and saw Fleury, Talma, the
      two Baptistes, or Michot, he went no further than the murky passage where
      theatre-goers used to stand in a string from half-past five in the
      afternoon till the hour when the doors opened, and belated comers were
      compelled to pay ten sous for a place near the ticket-office. And after
      waiting for two hours, the cry of &ldquo;All tickets are sold!&rdquo; rang not
      unfrequently in the ears of disappointed students. When the play was over,
      Lucien went home with downcast eyes, through streets lined with living
      attractions, and perhaps fell in with one of those commonplace adventures
      which loom so large in a young and timorous imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Lucien counted over his remaining stock of money, and took alarm
      at the melting of his funds; a cold perspiration broke out upon him when
      he thought that the time had come when he must find a publisher, and try
      also to find work for which a publisher would pay him. The young
      journalist, with whom he had made a one-sided friendship, never came now
      to Flicoteaux&rsquo;s. Lucien was waiting for a chance&mdash;which failed to
      present itself. In Paris there are no chances except for men with a very
      wide circle of acquaintance; chances of success of every kind increase
      with the number of your connections; and, therefore, in this sense also
      the chances are in favor of the big battalions. Lucien had sufficient
      provincial foresight still left, and had no mind to wait until only a last
      few coins remained to him. He resolved to face the publishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one tolerably chilly September morning Lucien went down the Rue de la
      Harpe, with his two manuscripts under his arm. As he made his way to the
      Quai des Augustins, and went along, looking into the booksellers&rsquo; windows
      on one side and into the Seine on the other, his good genius might have
      counseled him to pitch himself into the water sooner than plunge into
      literature. After heart-searching hesitations, after a profound scrutiny
      of the various countenances, more or less encouraging, soft-hearted,
      churlish, cheerful, or melancholy, to be seen through the window panes, or
      in the doorways of the booksellers&rsquo; establishments, he espied a house
      where the shopmen were busy packing books at a great rate. Goods were
      being despatched. The walls were plastered with bills:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      JUST OUT.

     LE SOLITAIRE, by M. le Vicomte d&rsquo;Arlincourt.
         Third edition.
     LEONIDE, by Victor Ducange; five volumes
         12mo, printed on fine paper. 12 francs.
     INDUCTIONS MORALES, by Keratry.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are lucky, that they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The placard, a new and original idea of the celebrated Ladvocat, was just
      beginning to blossom out upon the walls. In no long space Paris was to
      wear motley, thanks to the exertions of his imitators, and the Treasury
      was to discover a new source of revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety sent the blood surging to Lucien&rsquo;s heart, as he who had been so
      great at Angouleme, so insignificant of late in Paris, slipped past the
      other houses, summoned up all his courage, and at last entered the shop
      thronged with assistants, customers, and booksellers&mdash;&ldquo;And authors
      too, perhaps!&rdquo; thought Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak with M. Vidal or M. Porchon,&rdquo; he said, addressing a
      shopman. He had read the names on the sign-board&mdash;VIDAL &amp; PORCHON
      (it ran), <i>French and foreign booksellers&rsquo; agents</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both gentlemen are engaged,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, the poet scrutinized the packages, and amused himself for
      a couple of hours by scanning the titles of books, looking into them, and
      reading a page or two here and there. At last, as he stood leaning against
      a window, he heard voices, and suspecting that the green curtains hid
      either Vidal or Porchon, he listened to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take five hundred copies of me? If you will, I will let you have
      them at five francs, and give fourteen to the dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that bring them in at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen sous less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four francs four sous?&rdquo; said Vidal or Porchon, whichever it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the vendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Credit your account?&rdquo; inquired the purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old humbug! you would settle with me in eighteen months&rsquo; time, with bills
      at a twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Settled at once,&rdquo; returned Vidal or Porchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bills at nine months?&rdquo; asked the publisher or author, who evidently was
      selling his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear fellow, twelve months,&rdquo; returned one of the firm of
      booksellers&rsquo; agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are simply cutting my throat!&rdquo; said the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in a year&rsquo;s time shall we have placed a hundred copies of <i>Leonide</i>?&rdquo;
       said the other voice. &ldquo;If books went off as fast as the publishers would
      like, we should be millionaires, my good sir; but they don&rsquo;t, they go as
      the public pleases. There is some one now bringing out an edition of
      Scott&rsquo;s novels at eighteen sous per volume, three livres twelve sous per
      copy, and you want me to give you more for your stale remainders? No. If
      you mean me to push this novel of yours, you must make it worth my while.&mdash;Vidal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stout man, with a pen behind his ear, came down from his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many copies of Ducange did you place last journey?&rdquo; asked Porchon of
      his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred of <i>Le Petit Vieillard de Calais</i>, but to sell them I
      was obliged to cry down two books which pay in less commission, and
      uncommonly fine &lsquo;nightingales&rsquo; they are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (A &ldquo;nightingale,&rdquo; as Lucien afterwards learned, is a bookseller&rsquo;s name for
      books that linger on hand, perched out of sight in the loneliest nooks in
      the shop.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; added Vidal, &ldquo;Picard is bringing out some novels, as you
      know. We have been promised twenty per cent on the published price to make
      the thing a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, at twelve months,&rdquo; the publisher answered in a piteous voice,
      thunderstruck by Vidal&rsquo;s confidential remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it an offer?&rdquo; Porchon inquired curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The stranger went out. After he had gone, Lucien heard Porchon say
      to Vidal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have three hundred copies on order now. We will keep him waiting for
      his settlement, sell the <i>Leonides</i> for five francs net, settlement
      in six months, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that will be fifteen hundred francs into our pockets,&rdquo; said Vidal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I saw quite well that he was in a fix. He is giving Ducange four
      thousand francs for two thousand copies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien cut Vidal short by appearing in the entrance of the den.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor of wishing you a good day, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said,
      addressing both partners. The booksellers nodded slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a French historical romance after the style of Scott. It is called
      <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i>; I propose to offer it to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porchon glanced at Lucien with lustreless eyes, and laid his pen down on
      the desk. Vidal stared rudely at the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not publishing booksellers, sir; we are booksellers&rsquo; agents,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;When we bring out a book ourselves, we only deal in well-known
      names; and we only take serious literature besides&mdash;history and
      epitomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my book is very serious. It is an attempt to set the struggle between
      Catholics and Calvinists in its true light; the Catholics were supporters
      of absolute monarchy, and the Protestants for a republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Vidal!&rdquo; shouted an assistant. Vidal fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say, sir, that your book is not a masterpiece,&rdquo; replied Porchon,
      with scanty civility, &ldquo;but we only deal in books that are ready printed.
      Go and see somebody that buys manuscripts. There is old Doguereau in the
      Rue du Coq, near the Louvre, he is in the romance line. If you had only
      spoken sooner, you might have seen Pollet, a competitor of Doguereau and
      of the publisher in the Wooden Galleries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a volume of poetry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Porchon!&rdquo; somebody shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poetry</i>!&rdquo; Porchon exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;For what do you take me?&rdquo; he
      added, laughing in Lucien&rsquo;s face. And he dived into the regions of the
      back shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went back across the Pont Neuf absorbed in reflection. From all
      that he understood of this mercantile dialect, it appeared that books,
      like cotton nightcaps, were to be regarded as articles of merchandise to
      be sold dear and bought cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made a mistake,&rdquo; said Lucien to himself; but, all the same, this
      rough-and-ready practical aspect of literature made an impression upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Rue du Coq he stopped in front of a modest-looking shop, which he
      had passed before. He saw the inscription DOGUEREAU, BOOKSELLER, painted
      above it in yellow letters on a green ground, and remembered that he had
      seen the name at the foot of the title-page of several novels at Blosse&rsquo;s
      reading-room. In he went, not without the inward trepidation which a man
      of any imagination feels at the prospect of a battle. Inside the shop he
      discovered an odd-looking old man, one of the queer characters of the
      trade in the days of the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doguereau wore a black coat with vast square skirts, when fashion required
      swallow-tail coats. His waistcoat was of some cheap material, a checked
      pattern of many colors; a steel chain, with a copper key attached to it,
      hung from his fob and dangled down over a roomy pair of black nether
      garments. The booksellers&rsquo; watch must have been the size of an onion.
      Iron-gray ribbed stockings, and shoes with silver buckles completed is
      costume. The old man&rsquo;s head was bare, and ornamented with a fringe of
      grizzled locks, quite poetically scanty. &ldquo;Old Doguereau,&rdquo; as Porchon
      styled him, was dressed half like a professor of belles-lettres as to his
      trousers and shoes, half like a tradesman with respect to the variegated
      waistcoat, the stockings, and the watch; and the same odd mixture appeared
      in the man himself. He united the magisterial, dogmatic air, and the
      hollow countenance of the professor of rhetoric with the sharp eyes,
      suspicious mouth, and vague uneasiness of the bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Doguereau?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young,&rdquo; remarked the bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My age, sir, has nothing to do with the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; and the old bookseller took up the manuscript. &ldquo;Ah, begad! <i>The
      Archer of Charles IX.</i>, a good title. Let us see now, young man, just
      tell me your subject in a word or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a historical work, sir, in the style of Scott. The character of the
      struggle between the Protestants and Catholics is depicted as a struggle
      between two opposed systems of government, in which the throne is
      seriously endangered. I have taken the Catholic side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! but you have ideas, young man. Very well, I will read your book, I
      promise you. I would rather have had something more in Mrs. Radcliffe&rsquo;s
      style; but if you are industrious, if you have some notion of style,
      conceptions, ideas, and the art of telling a story, I don&rsquo;t ask better
      than to be of use to you. What do we want but good manuscripts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going into the country this evening; I shall be back again the day
      after to-morrow. I shall have read your manuscript by that time; and if it
      suits me, we might come to terms that very day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his acquaintance so easy, Lucien was inspired with the unlucky idea
      of bringing the <i>Marguerites</i> upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a volume of poetry as well, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are a poet! Then I don&rsquo;t want your romance,&rdquo; and the old man
      handed back the manuscript. &ldquo;The rhyming fellows come to grief when they
      try their hands at prose. In prose you can&rsquo;t use words that mean nothing;
      you absolutely must say something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Sir Walter Scott, sir, wrote poetry as well as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Doguereau, relenting. He guessed that the young
      fellow before him was poor, and kept the manuscript. &ldquo;Where do you live? I
      will come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, all unsuspicious of the idea at the back of the old man&rsquo;s head,
      gave his address; he did not see that he had to do with a bookseller of
      the old school, a survival of the eighteenth century, when booksellers
      tried to keep Voltaires and Montesquieus starving in garrets under lock
      and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Latin Quarter. I am coming back that very way,&rdquo; said Doguereau, when
      he had read the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; thought Lucien, as he took his leave. &ldquo;So I have met with a
      friend to young authors, a man of taste who knows something. That is the
      kind of man for me! It is just as I said to David&mdash;talent soon makes
      its way in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went home again happy and light of heart; he dreamed of glory. He
      gave not another thought to the ominous words which fell on his ear as he
      stood by the counter in Vidal and Porchon&rsquo;s shop; he beheld himself the
      richer by twelve hundred francs at least. Twelve hundred francs! It meant
      a year in Paris, a whole year of preparation for the work that he meant to
      do. What plans he built on that hope! What sweet dreams, what visions of a
      life established on a basis of work! Mentally he found new quarters, and
      settled himself in them; it would not have taken much to set him making a
      purchase or two. He could only stave off impatience by constant reading at
      Blosse&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later old Doguereau come to the lodgings of his budding Sir
      Walter Scott. He was struck with the pains which Lucien had taken with the
      style of this his first work, delighted with the strong contrasts of
      character sanctioned by the epoch, and surprised at the spirited
      imagination which a young writer always displays in the scheming of a
      first plot&mdash;he had not been spoiled, thought old Daddy Doguereau. He
      had made up his mind to give a thousand francs for <i>The Archer of
      Charles IX.</i>; he would buy the copyright out and out, and bind Lucien
      by an engagement for several books, but when he came to look at the house,
      the old fox thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young fellow that lives here has none but simple tastes,&rdquo; said he to
      himself; &ldquo;he is fond of study, fond of work; I need not give more than
      eight hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth floor,&rdquo; answered the landlady, when he asked for M. Lucien de
      Rubempre. The old bookseller, peering up, saw nothing but the sky above
      the fourth floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young fellow,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;is a good-looking lad; one might go so
      far as to say that he is very handsome. If he were to make too much money,
      he would only fall into dissipated ways, and then he would not work. In
      the interests of us both, I shall only offer six hundred francs, in coin
      though, not paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the stairs and gave three raps at the door. Lucien came to open
      it. The room was forlorn in its bareness. A bowl of milk and a penny roll
      stood on the table. The destitution of genius made an impression on Daddy
      Doguereau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him preserve these simple habits of life, this frugality, these
      modest requirements,&rdquo; thought he.&mdash;Aloud he said: &ldquo;It is a pleasure
      to me to see you. Thus, sir, lived Jean-Jacques, whom you resemble in more
      ways than one. Amid such surroundings the fire of genius shines brightly;
      good work is done in such rooms as these. This is how men of letters
      should work, instead of living riotously in cafes and restaurants, wasting
      their time and talent and our money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your romance is not bad, young man. I was a professor of rhetoric once; I
      know French history, there are some capital things in it. You have a
      future before you, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I tell you so. We may do business together. I will buy your romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s heart swelled and throbbed with gladness. He was about to enter
      the world of literature; he should see himself in print at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you four hundred francs,&rdquo; continued Doguereau in honeyed
      accents, and he looked at Lucien with an air which seemed to betoken an
      effort of generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The volume?&rdquo; queried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the romance,&rdquo; said Doguereau, heedless of Lucien&rsquo;s surprise. &ldquo;In
      ready money,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;and you shall undertake to write two books for me
      every year for six years. If the first book is out of print in six months,
      I will give you six hundred francs for the others. So, if you write two
      books each year, you will be making a hundred francs a month; you will
      have a sure income, you will be well off. There are some authors whom I
      only pay three hundred francs for a romance; I give two hundred for
      translations of English books. Such prices would have been exorbitant in
      the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, we cannot possibly come to an understanding. Give me back my
      manuscript, I beg,&rdquo; said Lucien, in a cold chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said the old bookseller. &ldquo;You know nothing of business, sir.
      Before an author&rsquo;s first book can appear, a publisher is bound to sink
      sixteen hundred francs on the paper and the printing of it. It is easier
      to write a romance than to find all that money. I have a hundred romances
      in manuscript, and I have not a hundred and sixty thousand francs in my
      cash box, alas! I have not made so much in all these twenty years that I
      have been a bookseller. So you don&rsquo;t make a fortune by printing romances,
      you see. Vidal and Porchon only take them of us on conditions that grow
      harder and harder day by day. You have only your time to lose, while I am
      obliged to disburse two thousand francs. If we fail, <i>habent sua fata
      libelli</i>, I lose two thousand francs; while, as for you, you simply
      hurl an ode at the thick-headed public. When you have thought over this
      that I have the honor of telling you, you will come back to me.&mdash;<i>You
      will come back to me</i>!&rdquo; he asserted authoritatively, by way of reply to
      a scornful gesture made involuntarily by Lucien. &ldquo;So far from finding a
      publisher obliging enough to risk two thousand francs for an unknown
      writer, you will not find a publisher&rsquo;s clerk that will trouble himself to
      look through your screed. Now that I have read it I can point out a good
      many slips in grammar. You have put <i>observer</i> for <i>faire observer</i>
      and <i>malgre que</i>. <i>Malgre</i> is a preposition, and requires an
      object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien appeared to be humiliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I see you again, you will have lost a hundred francs,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I
      shall only give a hundred crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he rose and took his leave. On the threshold he said, &ldquo;If you
      had not something in you, and a future before you; if I did not take an
      interest in studious youth, I should not have made you such a handsome
      offer. A hundred francs per month! Think of it! After all, a romance in a
      drawer is not eating its head off like a horse in a stable, nor will it
      find you in victuals either, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien snatched up his manuscript and dashed it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather burn it, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a poet&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; returned his senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien devoured his bread and supped his bowl of milk, then he went
      downstairs. His room was not large enough for him; he was turning round
      and round in it like a lion in a cage at the Jardin des Plantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Bibliotheque Saint-Genevieve, whither Lucien was going, he had come
      to know a stranger by sight; a young man of five-and-twenty or
      thereabouts, working with the sustained industry which nothing can disturb
      nor distract, the sign by which your genuine literary worker is known.
      Evidently the young man had been reading there for some time, for the
      librarian and attendants all knew him and paid him special attention; the
      librarian would even allow him to take away books, with which Lucien saw
      him return in the morning. In the stranger student he recognized a brother
      in penury and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale-faced and slight and thin, with a fine forehead hidden by masses of
      black, tolerably unkempt hair, there was something about him that
      attracted indifferent eyes: it was a vague resemblance which he bore to
      portraits of the young Bonaparte, engraved from Robert Lefebvre&rsquo;s picture.
      That engraving is a poem of melancholy intensity, of suppressed ambition,
      of power working below the surface. Study the face carefully, and you will
      discover genius in it and discretion, and all the subtlety and greatness
      of the man. The portrait has speaking eyes like a woman&rsquo;s; they look out,
      greedy of space, craving difficulties to vanquish. Even if the name of
      Bonaparte were not written beneath it, you would gaze long at that face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s young student, the incarnation of this picture, usually wore
      footed trousers, shoes with thick soles to them, an overcoat of coarse
      cloth, a black cravat, a waistcoat of some gray-and-white material
      buttoned to the chin, and a cheap hat. Contempt for superfluity in dress
      was visible in his whole person. Lucien also discovered that the
      mysterious stranger with that unmistakable stamp which genius sets upon
      the forehead of its slaves was one of Flicoteaux&rsquo;s most regular customers;
      he ate to live, careless of the fare which appeared to be familiar to him,
      and drank water. Wherever Lucien saw him, at the library or at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s, there was a dignity in his manner, springing doubtless from
      the consciousness of a purpose that filled his life, a dignity which made
      him unapproachable. He had the expression of a thinker, meditation dwelt
      on the fine nobly carved brow. You could tell from the dark bright eyes,
      so clear-sighted and quick to observe, that their owner was wont to probe
      to the bottom of things. He gesticulated very little, his demeanor was
      grave. Lucien felt an involuntary respect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times already the pair had looked at each other at the Bibliotheque
      or at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s; many times they had been on the point of speaking, but
      neither of them had ventured so far as yet. The silent young man went off
      to the further end of the library, on the side at right angles to the
      Place de la Sorbonne, and Lucien had no opportunity of making his
      acquaintance, although he felt drawn to a worker whom he knew by
      indescribable tokens for a character of no common order. Both, as they
      came to know afterwards, were unsophisticated and shy, given to fears
      which cause a pleasurable emotion to solitary creatures. Perhaps they
      never would have been brought into communication if they had not come
      across each other that day of Lucien&rsquo;s disaster; for as Lucien turned into
      the Rue des Gres, he saw the student coming away from the Bibliotheque
      Sainte-Genevieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The library is closed; I don&rsquo;t know why, monsieur,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears were standing in Lucien&rsquo;s eyes; he expressed his thanks by one of
      those gestures that speak more eloquently than words, and unlock hearts at
      once when two men meet in youth. They went together along the Rue des Gres
      towards the Rue de la Harpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As that is so, I shall go to the Luxembourg for a walk,&rdquo; said Lucien.
      &ldquo;When you have come out, it is not easy to settle down to work again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; one&rsquo;s ideas will not flow in the proper current,&rdquo; remarked the
      stranger. &ldquo;Something seems to have annoyed you, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just had a queer adventure,&rdquo; said Lucien, and he told the history
      of his visit to the Quai, and gave an account of his subsequent dealings
      with the old bookseller. He gave his name and said a word or two of his
      position. In one month or thereabouts he had spent sixty francs on his
      board, thirty for lodging, twenty more francs in going to the theatre, and
      ten at Blosse&rsquo;s reading room&mdash;one hundred and twenty francs in all,
      and now he had just a hundred and twenty francs in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story is mine, monsieur, and the story of ten or twelve hundred
      young fellows besides who come from the country to Paris every year. There
      are others even worse off than we are. Do you see that theatre?&rdquo; he
      continued, indicating the turrets of the Odeon. &ldquo;There came one day to
      lodge in one of the houses in the square a man of talent who had fallen
      into the lowest depths of poverty. He was married, in addition to the
      misfortunes which we share with him, to a wife whom he loved; and the
      poorer or the richer, as you will, by two children. He was burdened with
      debt, but he put his faith in his pen. He took a comedy in five acts to
      the Odeon; the comedy was accepted, the management arranged to bring it
      out, the actors learned their parts, the stage manager urged on the
      rehearsals. Five several bits of luck, five dramas to be performed in real
      life, and far harder tasks than the writing of a five-act play. The poor
      author lodged in a garret; you can see the place from here. He drained his
      last resources to live until the first representation; his wife pawned her
      clothes, they all lived on dry bread. On the day of the final rehearsal,
      the household owed fifty francs in the Quarter to the baker, the
      milkwoman, and the porter. The author had only the strictly necessary
      clothes&mdash;a coat, a shirt, trousers, a waistcoat, and a pair of boots.
      He felt sure of his success; he kissed his wife. The end of their troubles
      was at hand. &lsquo;At last! There is nothing against us now,&rsquo; cried he.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,
      there is fire,&rsquo; said his wife; &lsquo;look, the Odeon is on fire!&rsquo;&mdash;The
      Odeon was on fire, monsieur. So do not you complain. You have clothes, you
      have neither wife nor child, you have a hundred and twenty francs for
      emergencies in your pocket, and you owe no one a penny.&mdash;Well, the
      piece went through a hundred and fifty representations at the Theatre
      Louvois. The King allowed the author a pension. &lsquo;Genius is patience,&rsquo; as
      Buffon said. And patience after all is a man&rsquo;s nearest approach to
      Nature&rsquo;s processes of creation. What is Art, monsieur, but Nature
      concentrated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the young men were striding along the walks of the
      Luxembourg, and in no long time Lucien learned the name of the stranger
      who was doing his best to administer comfort. That name has since grown
      famous. Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez is one of the most illustrious of living men of
      letters; one of the rare few who show us an example of &ldquo;a noble gift with
      a noble nature combined,&rdquo; to quote a poet&rsquo;s fine thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no cheap route to greatness,&rdquo; Daniel went on in his kind voice.
      &ldquo;The works of Genius are watered with tears. The gift that is in you, like
      an existence in the physical world, passes through childhood and its
      maladies. Nature sweeps away sickly or deformed creatures, and Society
      rejects an imperfectly developed talent. Any man who means to rise above
      the rest must make ready for a struggle and be undaunted by difficulties.
      A great writer is a martyr who does not die; that is all.&mdash;There is
      the stamp of genius on your forehead,&rdquo; d&rsquo;Arthez continued, enveloping
      Lucien by a glance; &ldquo;but unless you have within you the will of genius,
      unless you are gifted with angelic patience, unless, no matter how far the
      freaks of Fate have set you from your destined goal, you can find the way
      to your Infinite as the turtles in the Indies find their way to the ocean,
      you had better give up at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you yourself expect these ordeals?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trials of every kind, slander and treachery, and effrontery and cunning,
      the rivals who act unfairly, and the keen competition of the literary
      market,&rdquo; his companion said resignedly. &ldquo;What is a first loss, if only
      your work was good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you look at mine and give me your opinion?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez. &ldquo;I am living in the Rue des Quatre-Vents.
      Desplein, one of the most illustrious men of genius in our time, the
      greatest surgeon that the world has known, once endured the martyrdom of
      early struggles with the first difficulties of a glorious career in the
      same house. I think of that every night, and the thought gives me the
      stock of courage that I need every morning. I am living in the very room
      where, like Rousseau, he had no Theresa. Come in an hour&rsquo;s time. I shall
      be in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poets grasped each other&rsquo;s hands with a rush of melancholy and tender
      feeling inexpressible in words, and went their separate ways; Lucien to
      fetch his manuscript, Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez to pawn his watch and buy a couple
      of faggots. The weather was cold, and his new-found friend should find a
      fire in his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was punctual. He noticed at once that the house was of an even
      poorer class than the Hotel de Cluny. A staircase gradually became visible
      at the further end of a dark passage; he mounted to the fifth floor, and
      found d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bookcase of dark-stained wood, with rows of labeled cardboard cases on
      the shelves, stood between the two crazy windows. A gaunt, painted wooden
      bedstead, of the kind seen in school dormitories, a night-table, picked up
      cheaply somewhere, and a couple of horsehair armchairs, filled the further
      end of the room. The wall-paper, a Highland plaid pattern, was glazed over
      with the grime of years. Between the window and the grate stood a long
      table littered with papers, and opposite the fireplace there was a cheap
      mahogany chest of drawers. A second-hand carpet covered the floor&mdash;a
      necessary luxury, for it saved firing. A common office armchair, cushioned
      with leather, crimson once, but now hoary with wear, was drawn up to the
      table. Add half-a-dozen rickety chairs, and you have a complete list of
      the furniture. Lucien noticed an old-fashioned candle-sconce for a
      card-table, with an adjustable screen attached, and wondered to see four
      wax candles in the sockets. D&rsquo;Arthez explained that he could not endure
      the smell of tallow, a little trait denoting great delicacy of sense
      perception, and the exquisite sensibility which accompanies it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading lasted for seven hours. Daniel listened conscientiously,
      forbearing to interrupt by word or comment&mdash;one of the rarest proofs
      of good taste in a listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Lucien, laying the manuscript on the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a good start on the right way,&rdquo; d&rsquo;Arthez answered
      judicially, &ldquo;but you must go over your work again. You must strike out a
      different style for yourself if you do not mean to ape Sir Walter Scott,
      for you have taken him for your model. You begin, for instance, as he
      begins, with long conversations to introduce your characters, and only
      when they have said their say does description and action follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This opposition, necessary in all work of a dramatic kind, comes last.
      Just put the terms of the problem the other way round. Give descriptions,
      to which our language lends itself so admirably, instead of diffuse
      dialogue, magnificent in Scott&rsquo;s work, but colorless in your own. Lead
      naturally up to your dialogue. Plunge straight into the action. Treat your
      subject from different points of view, sometimes in a side-light,
      sometimes retrospectively; vary your methods, in fact, to diversify your
      work. You may be original while adapting the Scots novelist&rsquo;s form of
      dramatic dialogue to French history. There is no passion in Scott&rsquo;s
      novels; he ignores passion, or perhaps it was interdicted by the
      hypocritical manners of his country. Woman for him is duty incarnate. His
      heroines, with possibly one or two exceptions, are all alike; he has drawn
      them all from the same model, as painters say. They are, every one of
      them, descended from Clarissa Harlowe. And returning continually, as he
      did, to the same idea of woman, how could he do otherwise than produce a
      single type, varied only by degrees of vividness in the coloring? Woman
      brings confusion into Society through passion. Passion gives infinite
      possibilities. Therefore depict passion; you have one great resource open
      to you, foregone by the great genius for the sake of providing family
      reading for prudish England. In France you have the charming sinner, the
      brightly-colored life of Catholicism, contrasted with sombre Calvinistic
      figures on a background of the times when passions ran higher than at any
      other period of our history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every epoch which has left authentic records since the time of Charles
      the Great calls for at least one romance. Some require four or five; the
      periods of Louis XIV., of Henry IV., of Francis I., for instance. You
      would give us in this way a picturesque history of France, with the
      costumes and furniture, the houses and their interiors, and domestic life,
      giving us the spirit of the time instead of a laborious narration of
      ascertained facts. Then there is further scope for originality. You can
      remove some of the popular delusions which disfigure the memories of most
      of our kings. Be bold enough in this first work of yours to rehabilitate
      the great magnificent figure of Catherine, whom you have sacrificed to the
      prejudices which still cloud her name. And finally, paint Charles IX. for
      us as he really was, and not as Protestant writers have made him. Ten
      years of persistent work, and fame and fortune will be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time it was nine o&rsquo;clock; Lucien followed the example set in
      secret by his future friend by asking him to dine at Eldon&rsquo;s, and spent
      twelve francs at that restaurant. During the dinner Daniel admitted Lucien
      into the secret of his hopes and studies. Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez would not allow
      that any writer could attain to a pre-eminent rank without a profound
      knowledge of metaphysics. He was engaged in ransacking the spoils of
      ancient and modern philosophy, and in the assimilation of it all; he would
      be like Moliere, a profound philosopher first, and a writer of comedies
      afterwards. He was studying the world of books and the living world about
      him&mdash;thought and fact. His friends were learned naturalists, young
      doctors of medicine, political writers and artists, a number of earnest
      students full of promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Arthez earned a living by conscientious and ill-paid work; he wrote
      articles for encyclopaedias, dictionaries of biography and natural
      science, doing just enough to enable him to live while he followed his own
      bent, and neither more nor less. He had a piece of imaginative work on
      hand, undertaken solely for the sake of studying the resources of
      language, an important psychological study in the form of a novel,
      unfinished as yet, for d&rsquo;Arthez took it up or laid it down as the humor
      took him, and kept it for days of great distress. D&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s revelations
      of himself were made very simply, but to Lucien he seemed like an
      intellectual giant; and by eleven o&rsquo;clock, when they left the restaurant,
      he began to feel a sudden, warm friendship for this nature, unconscious of
      its loftiness, this unostentatious worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien took d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s advice unquestioningly, and followed it out to the
      letter. The most magnificent palaces of fancy had been suddenly flung open
      to him by a nobly-gifted mind, matured already by thought and critical
      examinations undertaken for their own sake, not for publication, but for
      the solitary thinker&rsquo;s own satisfaction. The burning coal had been laid on
      the lips of the poet of Angouleme, a word uttered by a hard student in
      Paris had fallen upon ground prepared to receive it in the provincial.
      Lucien set about recasting his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his gladness at finding in the wilderness of Paris a nature abounding
      in generous and sympathetic feeling, the distinguished provincial did, as
      all young creatures hungering for affection are wont to do; he fastened,
      like a chronic disease, upon this one friend that he had found. He called
      for D&rsquo;Arthez on his way to the Bibliotheque, walked with him on fine days
      in the Luxembourg Gardens, and went with his friend every evening as far
      as the door of his lodging-house after sitting next to him at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s. He pressed close to his friend&rsquo;s side as a soldier might
      keep by a comrade on the frozen Russian plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those early days of his acquaintance, he noticed, not without
      chagrin, that his presence imposed a certain restraint on the circle of
      Daniel&rsquo;s intimates. The talk of those superior beings of whom d&rsquo;Arthez
      spoke to him with such concentrated enthusiasm kept within the bounds of a
      reserve but little in keeping with the evident warmth of their
      friendships. At these times Lucien discreetly took his leave, a feeling of
      curiosity mingling with the sense of something like pain at the ostracism
      to which he was subjected by these strangers, who all addressed each other
      by their Christian names. Each one of them, like d&rsquo;Arthez, bore the stamp
      of genius upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some private opposition, overcome by d&rsquo;Arthez without Lucien&rsquo;s
      knowledge, the newcomer was at length judged worthy to make one of the <i>cenacle</i>
      of lofty thinkers. Henceforward he was to be one of a little group of
      young men who met almost every evening in d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s room, united by the
      keenest sympathies and by the earnestness of their intellectual life. They
      all foresaw a great writer in d&rsquo;Arthez; they looked upon him as their
      chief since the loss of one of their number, a mystical genius, one of the
      most extraordinary intellects of the age. This former leader had gone back
      to his province for reasons on which it serves no purpose to enter, but
      Lucien often heard them speak of this absent friend as &ldquo;Louis.&rdquo; Several of
      the group were destined to fall by the way; but others, like d&rsquo;Arthez,
      have since won all the fame that was their due. A few details as to the
      circle will readily explain Lucien&rsquo;s strong feeling of interest and
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One among those who still survive was Horace Bianchon, then a
      house-student at the Hotel-Dieu; later, a shining light at the Ecole de
      Paris, and now so well known that it is needless to give any description
      of his appearance, genius, or character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came Leon Giraud, that profound philosopher and bold theorist,
      turning all systems inside out, criticising, expressing, and formulating,
      dragging them all to the feet of his idol&mdash;Humanity; great even in
      his errors, for his honesty ennobled his mistakes. An intrepid toiler, a
      conscientious scholar, he became the acknowledged head of a school of
      moralists and politicians. Time alone can pronounce upon the merits of his
      theories; but if his convictions have drawn him into paths in which none
      of his old comrades tread, none the less he is still their faithful
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art was represented by Joseph Bridau, one of the best painters among the
      younger men. But for a too impressionable nature, which made havoc of
      Joseph&rsquo;s heart, he might have continued the traditions of the great
      Italian masters, though, for that matter, the last word has not yet been
      said concerning him. He combines Roman outline with Venetian color; but
      love is fatal to his work, love not merely transfixes his heart, but sends
      his arrow through the brain, deranges the course of his life, and sets the
      victim describing the strangest zigzags. If the mistress of the moment is
      too kind or too cruel, Joseph will send into the Exhibition sketches where
      the drawing is clogged with color, or pictures finished under the stress
      of some imaginary woe, in which he gave his whole attention to the
      drawing, and left the color to take care of itself. He is a constant
      disappointment to his friends and the public; yet Hoffmann would have
      worshiped him for his daring experiments in the realms of art. When Bridau
      is wholly himself he is admirable, and as praise is sweet to him, his
      disgust is great when one praises the failures in which he alone discovers
      all that is lacking in the eyes of the public. He is whimsical to the last
      degree. His friends have seen him destroy a finished picture because, in
      his eyes, it looked too smooth. &ldquo;It is overdone,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;it is
      niggling work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his eccentric, yet lofty nature, with a nervous organization and all
      that it entails of torment and delight, the craving for perfection becomes
      morbid. Intellectually he is akin to Sterne, though he is not a literary
      worker. There is an indescribable piquancy about his epigrams and sallies
      of thought. He is eloquent, he knows how to love, but the uncertainty that
      appears in his execution is a part of the very nature of the man. The
      brotherhood loved him for the very qualities which the philistine would
      style defects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last among the living comes Fulgence Ridal. No writer of our times
      possesses more of the exuberant spirit of pure comedy than this poet,
      careless of fame, who will fling his more commonplace productions to
      theatrical managers, and keep the most charming scenes in the seraglio of
      his brain for himself and his friends. Of the public he asks just
      sufficient to secure his independence, and then declines to do anything
      more. Indolent and prolific as Rossini, compelled, like great
      poet-comedians, like Moliere and Rabelais, to see both sides of
      everything, and all that is to be said both for and against, he is a
      sceptic, ready to laugh at all things. Fulgence Ridal is a great practical
      philosopher. His worldly wisdom, his genius for observation, his contempt
      for fame (&ldquo;fuss,&rdquo; as he calls it) have not seared a kind heart. He is as
      energetic on behalf of another as he is careless where his own interests
      are concerned; and if he bestirs himself, it is for a friend. Living up to
      his Rabelaisian mask, he is no enemy to good cheer, though he never goes
      out of his way to find it; he is melancholy and gay. His friends dubbed
      him the &ldquo;Dog of the Regiment.&rdquo; You could have no better portrait of the
      man than his nickname.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three more of the band, at least as remarkable as the friends who have
      just been sketched in outline, were destined to fall by the way. Of these,
      Meyraux was the first. Meyraux died after stirring up the famous
      controversy between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a great question
      which divided the whole scientific world into two opposite camps, with
      these two men of equal genius as leaders. This befell some months before
      the death of the champion of rigorous analytical science as opposed to the
      pantheism of one who is still living to bear an honored name in Germany.
      Meyraux was the friend of that &ldquo;Louis&rdquo; of whom death was so soon to rob
      the intellectual world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these two, both marked by death, and unknown to-day in spite of their
      wide knowledge and their genius, stands a third, Michel Chrestien, the
      great Republican thinker, who dreamed of European Federation, and had no
      small share in bringing about the Saint-Simonian movement of 1830. A
      politician of the calibre of Saint-Just and Danton, but simple, meek as a
      maid, and brimful of illusions and loving-kindness; the owner of a singing
      voice which would have sent Mozart, or Weber, or Rossini into ecstasies,
      for his singing of certain songs of Beranger&rsquo;s could intoxicate the heart
      in you with poetry, or hope, or love&mdash;Michel Chrestien, poor as
      Lucien, poor as Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez, as all the rest of his friends, gained a
      living with the haphazard indifference of a Diogenes. He indexed lengthy
      works, he drew up prospectuses for booksellers, and kept his doctrines to
      himself, as the grave keeps the secrets of the dead. Yet the gay bohemian
      of intellectual life, the great statesman who might have changed the face
      of the world, fell as a private soldier in the cloister of Saint-Merri;
      some shopkeeper&rsquo;s bullet struck down one of the noblest creatures that
      ever trod French soil, and Michel Chrestien died for other doctrines than
      his own. His Federation scheme was more dangerous to the aristocracy of
      Europe than the Republican propaganda; it was more feasible and less
      extravagant than the hideous doctrines of indefinite liberty proclaimed by
      the young madcaps who assume the character of heirs of the Convention. All
      who knew the noble plebeian wept for him; there is not one of them but
      remembers, and often remembers, a great obscure politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esteem and friendship kept the peace between the extremes of hostile
      opinion and conviction represented in the brotherhood. Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez
      came of a good family in Picardy. His belief in the Monarchy was quite as
      strong as Michel Chrestien&rsquo;s faith in European Federation. Fulgence Ridal
      scoffed at Leon Giraud&rsquo;s philosophical doctrines, while Giraud himself
      prophesied for d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s benefit the approaching end of Christianity and
      the extinction of the institution of the family. Michel Chrestien, a
      believer in the religion of Christ, the divine lawgiver, who taught the
      equality of men, would defend the immortality of the soul from Bianchon&rsquo;s
      scalpel, for Horace Bianchon was before all things an analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was plenty of discussion, but no bickering. Vanity was not engaged,
      for the speakers were also the audience. They would talk over their work
      among themselves and take counsel of each other with the delightful
      openness of youth. If the matter in hand was serious, the opponent would
      leave his own position to enter into his friend&rsquo;s point of view; and being
      an impartial judge in a matter outside his own sphere, would prove the
      better helper; envy, the hideous treasure of disappointment, abortive
      talent, failure, and mortified vanity, was quite unknown among them. All
      of them, moreover, were going their separate ways. For these reasons,
      Lucien and others admitted to their society felt at their ease in it.
      Wherever you find real talent, you will find frank good fellowship and
      sincerity, and no sort of pretension, the wit that caresses the intellect
      and never is aimed at self-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first nervousness, caused by respect, wore off, it was
      unspeakably pleasant to make one of this elect company of youth.
      Familiarity did not exclude in each a consciousness of his own value, nor
      a profound esteem for his neighbor; and finally, as every member of the
      circle felt that he could afford to receive or to give, no one made a
      difficulty of accepting. Talk was unflagging, full of charm, and ranging
      over the most varied topics; words light as arrows sped to the mark. There
      was a strange contrast between the dire material poverty in which the
      young men lived and the splendor of their intellectual wealth. They looked
      upon the practical problems of existence simply as matter for friendly
      jokes. The cold weather happened to set in early that year. Five of
      d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s friends appeared one day, each concealing firewood under his
      cloak; the same idea had occurred to the five, as it sometimes happens
      that all the guests at a picnic are inspired with the notion of bringing a
      pie as their contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of them were gifted with the moral beauty which reacts upon the
      physical form, and, no less than work and vigils, overlays a youthful face
      with a shade of divine gold; purity of life and the fire of thought had
      brought refinement and regularity into features somewhat pinched and
      rugged. The poet&rsquo;s amplitude of brow was a striking characteristic common
      to them all; the bright, sparkling eyes told of cleanliness of life. The
      hardships of penury, when they were felt at all, were born so gaily and
      embraced with such enthusiasm, that they had left no trace to mar the
      serenity peculiar to the faces of the young who have no grave errors laid
      to their charge as yet, who have not stooped to any of the base
      compromises wrung from impatience of poverty by the strong desire to
      succeed. The temptation to use any means to this end is the greater since
      that men of letters are lenient with bad faith and extend an easy
      indulgence to treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an element in friendship which doubles its charm and renders it
      indissoluble&mdash;a sense of certainty which is lacking in love. These
      young men were sure of themselves and of each other; the enemy of one was
      the enemy of all; the most urgent personal considerations would have been
      shattered if they had clashed with the sacred solidarity of their
      fellowship. All alike incapable of disloyalty, they could oppose a
      formidable No to any accusation brought against the absent and defend them
      with perfect confidence. With a like nobility of nature and strength of
      feeling, it was possible to think and speak freely on all matters of
      intellectual or scientific interest; hence the honesty of their
      friendships, the gaiety of their talk, and with this intellectual freedom
      of the community there was no fear of being misunderstood; they stood upon
      no ceremony with each other; they shared their troubles and joys, and gave
      thought and sympathy from full hearts. The charming delicacy of feeling
      which makes the tale of <i>Deux Amis</i> a treasury for great souls, was
      the rule of their daily life. It may be imagined, therefore, that their
      standard of requirements was not an easy one; they were too conscious of
      their worth, too well aware of their happiness, to care to trouble their
      life with the admixture of a new and unknown element.
    </p>
    <p>
      This federation of interests and affection lasted for twenty years without
      a collision or disappointment. Death alone could thin the numbers of the
      noble Pleiades, taking first Louis Lambert, later Meyraux and Michel
      Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Michel Chrestien fell in 1832 his friends went, in spite of the
      perils of the step, to find his body at Saint-Merri; and Horace Bianchon,
      Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez, Leon Giraud, Joseph Bridau, and Fulgence Ridal performed
      the last duties to the dead, between two political fires. By night they
      buried their beloved in the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise; Horace Bianchon,
      undaunted by the difficulties, cleared them away one after another&mdash;it
      was he indeed who besought the authorities for permission to bury the
      fallen insurgent and confessed to his old friendship with the dead
      Federalist. The little group of friends present at the funeral with those
      five great men will never forget that touching scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you walk in the trim cemetery you will see a grave purchased in
      perpetuity, a grass-covered mound with a dark wooden cross above it, and
      the name in large red letters&mdash;MICHEL CHRESTIEN. There is no other
      monument like it. The friends thought to pay a tribute to the sternly
      simple nature of the man by the simplicity of the record of his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in that chilly garret, the fairest dreams of friendship were realized.
      These men were brothers leading lives of intellectual effort, loyally
      helping each other, making no reservations, not even of their worst
      thoughts; men of vast acquirements, natures tried in the crucible of
      poverty. Once admitted as an equal among such elect souls, Lucien
      represented beauty and poetry. They admired the sonnets which he read to
      them; they would ask him for a sonnet as he would ask Michel Chrestien for
      a song. And, in the desert of Paris, Lucien found an oasis in the Rue des
      Quatre-Vents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of October, Lucien had spent the last of his money on a
      little firewood; he was half-way through the task of recasting his work,
      the most strenuous of all toil, and he was penniless. As for Daniel
      d&rsquo;Arthez, burning blocks of spent tan, and facing poverty like a hero, not
      a word of complaint came from him; he was as sober as any elderly
      spinster, and methodical as a miser. This courage called out Lucien&rsquo;s
      courage; he had only newly come into the circle, and shrank with
      invincible repugnance from speaking of his straits. One morning he went
      out, manuscript in hand, and reached the Rue du Coq; he would sell <i>The
      Archer of Charles IX.</i> to Doguereau; but Doguereau was out. Lucien
      little knew how indulgent great natures can be to the weaknesses of
      others. Every one of the friends had thought of the peculiar troubles
      besetting the poetic temperament, of the prostration which follows upon
      the struggle, when the soul has been overwrought by the contemplation of
      that nature which it is the task of art to reproduce. And strong as they
      were to endure their own ills, they felt keenly for Lucien&rsquo;s distress;
      they guessed that his stock of money was failing; and after all the
      pleasant evenings spent in friendly talk and deep meditations, after the
      poetry, the confidences, the bold flights over the fields of thought or
      into the far future of the nations, yet another trait was to prove how
      little Lucien had understood these new friends of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucien, dear fellow,&rdquo; said Daniel, &ldquo;you did not dine at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s
      yesterday, and we know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien could not keep back the overflowing tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You showed a want of confidence in us,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien; &ldquo;we shall
      chalk that up over the chimney, and when we have scored ten we will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have all of us found a bit of extra work,&rdquo; said Bianchon; &ldquo;for my own
      part, I have been looking after a rich patient for Desplein; d&rsquo;Arthez has
      written an article for the <i>Revue Encyclopedique</i>; Chrestien thought
      of going out to sing in the Champs Elysees of an evening with a
      pocket-handkerchief and four candles, but he found a pamphlet to write
      instead for a man who has a mind to go into politics, and gave his
      employer six hundred francs worth of Machiavelli; Leon Giraud borrowed
      fifty francs of his publisher, Joseph sold one or two sketches; and
      Fulgence&rsquo;s piece was given on Sunday, and there was a full house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are two hundred francs,&rdquo; said Daniel, &ldquo;and let us say no more about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if he is not going to hug us all as if we had done something
      extraordinary!&rdquo; cried Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, meanwhile, had written to the home circle. His letter was a
      masterpiece of sensibility and goodwill, as well as a sharp cry wrung from
      him by distress. The answers which he received the next day will give some
      idea of the delight that Lucien took in this living encyclopedia of
      angelic spirits, each of whom bore the stamp of the art or science which
      he followed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    <i>David Sechard to Lucien.</i>

  &ldquo;MY DEAR LUCIEN,&mdash;Enclosed herewith is a bill at ninety days,
  payable to your order, for two hundred francs. You can draw on M.
  Metivier, paper merchant, our Paris correspondent in the Rue
  Serpente. My good Lucien, we have absolutely nothing. Eve has
  undertaken the charge of the printing-house, and works at her task
  with such devotion, patience, and industry, that I bless heaven
  for giving me such an angel for a wife. She herself says that it
  is impossible to send you the least help. But I think, my friend
  now that you are started in so promising a way, with such great
  and noble hearts for your companions, that you can hardly fail to
  reach the greatness to which you were born, aided as you are by
  intelligence almost divine in Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez and Michel Chrestien
  and Leon Giraud, and counseled by Meyraux and Bianchon and Ridal,
  whom we have come to know through your dear letter. So I have
  drawn this bill without Eve&rsquo;s knowledge, and I will contrive
  somehow to meet it when the time comes. Keep on your way, Lucien;
  it is rough, but it will be glorious. I can bear anything but the
  thought of you sinking into the sloughs of Paris, of which I saw
  so much. Have sufficient strength of mind to do as you are doing,
  and keep out of scrapes and bad company, wild young fellows and
  men of letters of a certain stamp, whom I learned to take at their
  just valuation when I lived in Paris. Be a worthy compeer of the
  divine spirits whom we have learned to love through you. Your life
  will soon meet with its reward. Farewell, dearest brother; you
  have sent transports of joy to my heart. I did not expect such
  courage of you.
</pre>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;DAVID.&rdquo;
     </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    <i>Eve Sechard to Lucien.</i>

  &ldquo;DEAR,&mdash;your letter made all of us cry. As for the noble hearts to
  whom your good angel surely led you, tell them that a mother and a
  poor young wife will pray for them night and morning; and if the
  most fervent prayers can reach the Throne of God, surely they will
  bring blessings upon you all. Their names are engraved upon my
  heart. Ah! some day I shall see your friends; I will go to Paris,
  if I have to walk the whole way, to thank them for their
  friendship for you, for to me the thought has been like balm to
  smarting wounds. We are working like day laborers here, dear. This
  husband of mine, the unknown great man whom I love more and more
  every day, as I discover moment by moment the wealth of his
  nature, leaves the printing-house more and more to me. Why, I
  guess. Our poverty, yours, and ours, and our mother&rsquo;s, is
  heartbreaking to him. Our adored David is a Prometheus gnawed by a
  vulture, a haggard, sharp-beaked regret. As for himself, noble
  fellow, he scarcely thinks of himself; he is hoping to make a
  fortune for <i>us</i>. He spends his whole time in experiments in
  paper-making; he begged me to take his place and look after the
  business, and gives me as much help as his preoccupation allows.
  Alas! I shall be a mother soon. That should have been a crowning
  joy; but as things are, it saddens me. Poor mother! she has grown
  young again; she has found strength to go back to her tiring
  nursing. We should be happy if it were not for these money cares.
  Old Father Sechard will not give his son a farthing. David went
  over to see if he could borrow a little for you, for we were in
  despair over your letter. &lsquo;I know Lucien,&rsquo; David said; &lsquo;he will
  lose his head and do something rash.&rsquo;&mdash;I gave him a good scolding.
  &lsquo;My brother disappoint us in any way!&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;Lucien knows
  that I should die of sorrow.&rsquo;&mdash;Mother and I have pawned a few
  things; David does not know about it, mother will redeem them as
  soon as she has made a little money. In this way we have managed
  to put together a hundred francs, which I am sending you by the
  coach. If I did not answer your last letter, do not remember it
  against me, dear; we were working all night just then. I have been
  working like a man. Oh, I had no idea that I was so strong!

  &ldquo;Mme. de Bargeton is a heartless woman; she has no soul; even if
  she cared for you no longer, she owed it to herself to use her
  influence for you and to help you when she had torn you from us to
  plunge you into that dreadful sea of Paris. Only by the special
  blessing of Heaven could you have met with true friends there
  among those crowds of men and innumerable interests. She is not
  worth a regret. I used to wish that there might be some devoted
  woman always with you, a second myself; but now I know that your
  friends will take my place, and I am happy. Spread your wings, my
  dear great genius, you will be our pride as well as our beloved.
</pre>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;EVE.&rdquo;
     </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; the mother wrote, &ldquo;I can only add my blessing to all
  that your sister says, and assure you that you are more in my
  thoughts and in my prayers (alas!) than those whom I see daily;
  for some hearts, the absent are always in the right, and so it is
  with the heart of your mother.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So two days after the loan was offered so graciously, Lucien repaid it.
      Perhaps life had never seemed so bright to him as at that moment; but the
      touch of self-love in his joy did not escape the delicate sensibility and
      searching eyes of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one might think that you were afraid to owe us anything,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Fulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the pleasure that he takes in returning the money is a very serious
      symptom to my mind,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien. &ldquo;It confirms some observations
      of my own. There is a spice of vanity in Lucien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a poet,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you grudge me such a very natural feeling?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should bear in mind that he did not hide it,&rdquo; said Leon Giraud; &ldquo;he is
      still open with us; but I am afraid that he may come to feel shy of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; Lucien asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can read your thoughts,&rdquo; answered Joseph Bridau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a diabolical spirit in you that will seek to justify courses
      which are utterly contrary to our principles. Instead of being a sophist
      in theory, you will be a sophist in practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am afraid of that,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez. &ldquo;You will carry on admirable
      debates in your own mind, Lucien, and take up a lofty position in theory,
      and end by blameworthy actions. You will never be at one with yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ground have you for these charges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy vanity, dear poet, is so great that it intrudes itself even into thy
      friendships!&rdquo; cried Fulgence. &ldquo;All vanity of that sort is a symptom of
      shocking egoism, and egoism poisons friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;you cannot know how much I love you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you loved us as we love you, would you have been in such a hurry to
      return the money which we had such pleasure in lending? or have made so
      much of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t lend here; we give,&rdquo; said Joseph Bridau roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think us unkind, dear boy,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien; &ldquo;we are looking
      forward. We are afraid lest some day you may prefer a petty revenge to the
      joys of pure friendship. Read Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Tasso</i>, the great master&rsquo;s
      greatest work, and you will see how the poet-hero loved gorgeous stuffs
      and banquets and triumph and applause. Very well, be Tasso without his
      folly. Perhaps the world and its pleasures tempt you? Stay with us. Carry
      all the cravings of vanity into the world of imagination. Transpose folly.
      Keep virtue for daily wear, and let imagination run riot, instead of
      doing, as d&rsquo;Arthez says, thinking high thoughts and living beneath them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien hung his head. His friends were right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that you are stronger than I,&rdquo; he said, with a charming glance
      at them. &ldquo;My back and shoulders are not made to bear the burden of Paris
      life; I cannot struggle bravely. We are born with different temperaments
      and faculties, and you know better than I that faults and virtues have
      their reverse side. I am tired already, I confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will stand by you,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez; &ldquo;it is just in these ways that a
      faithful friendship is of use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The help that I have just received is precarious, and every one of us is
      just as poor as another; want will soon overtake me again. Chrestien, at
      the service of the first that hires him, can do nothing with the
      publishers; Bianchon is quite out of it; d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s booksellers only deal
      in scientific and technical books&mdash;they have no connection with
      publishers of new literature; and as for Horace and Fulgence Ridal and
      Bridau, their work lies miles away from the booksellers. There is no help
      for it; I must make up my mind one way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick by us, and make up your mind to it,&rdquo; said Bianchon. &ldquo;Bear up
      bravely, and trust in hard work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is hardship for you is death for me,&rdquo; Lucien put in quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the cock crows thrice,&rdquo; smiled Leon Giraud, &ldquo;this man will betray
      the cause of work for an idle life and the vices of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has work brought you?&rdquo; asked Lucien, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you start out from Paris for Italy, you don&rsquo;t find Rome half-way,&rdquo;
       said Joseph Bridau. &ldquo;You want your pease to grow ready buttered for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation ended in a joke, and they changed the subject. Lucien&rsquo;s
      friends, with their perspicacity and delicacy of heart, tried to efface
      the memory of the little quarrel; but Lucien knew thenceforward that it
      was no easy matter to deceive them. He soon fell into despair, which he
      was careful to hide from such stern mentors as he imagined them to be; and
      the Southern temper that runs so easily through the whole gamut of mental
      dispositions, set him making the most contradictory resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again he talked of making the plunge into journalism; and time
      after time did his friends reply with a &ldquo;Mind you do nothing of the sort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the tomb of the beautiful, gracious Lucien whom we love and
      know,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not hold out for long between the two extremes of toil and
      pleasure which make up a journalist&rsquo;s life, and resistance is the very
      foundation of virtue. You would be so delighted to exercise your power of
      life and death over the offspring of the brain, that you would be an
      out-and-out journalist in two months&rsquo; time. To be a journalist&mdash;that
      is to turn Herod in the republic of letters. The man who will say anything
      will end by sticking at nothing. That was Napoleon&rsquo;s maxim, and it
      explains itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would be with me, would you not?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by that time,&rdquo; said Fulgence. &ldquo;If you were a journalist, you would no
      more think of us than the Opera girl in all her glory, with her adorers
      and her silk-lined carriage, thinks of the village at home and her cows
      and her sabots. You could never resist the temptation to pen a witticism,
      though it should bring tears to a friend&rsquo;s eyes. I come across journalists
      in theatre lobbies; it makes me shudder to see them. Journalism is an
      inferno, a bottomless pit of iniquity and treachery and lies; no one can
      traverse it undefiled, unless, like Dante, he is protected by Virgil&rsquo;s
      sacred laurel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the more the set of friends opposed the idea of journalism, the more
      Lucien&rsquo;s desire to know its perils grew and tempted him. He began to
      debate within his own mind; was it not ridiculous to allow want to find
      him a second time defenceless? He bethought him of the failure of his
      attempts to dispose of his first novel, and felt but little tempted to
      begin a second. How, besides, was he to live while he was writing another
      romance? One month of privation had exhausted his stock of patience. Why
      should he not do nobly that which journalists did ignobly and without
      principle? His friends insulted him with their doubts; he would convince
      them of his strength of mind. Some day, perhaps, he would be of use to
      them; he would be the herald of their fame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what sort of a friendship is it which recoils from complicity?&rdquo;
       demanded he one evening of Michel Chrestien; Lucien and Leon Giraud were
      walking home with their friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shrink from nothing,&rdquo; Michel Chrestien made reply. &ldquo;If you were so
      unlucky as to kill your mistress, I would help you to hide your crime, and
      could still respect you; but if you were to turn spy, I should shun you
      with abhorrence, for a spy is systematically shameless and base. There you
      have journalism summed up in a sentence. Friendship can pardon error and
      the hasty impulse of passion; it is bound to be inexorable when a man
      deliberately traffics in his own soul, and intellect, and opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why cannot I turn journalist to sell my volume of poetry and the novel,
      and then give up at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Machiavelli might do so, but not Lucien de Rubempre,&rdquo; said Leon Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien; &ldquo;I will show you that I can do as much as
      Machiavelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Michel, grasping Leon&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;you have done it, Leon.&mdash;Lucien,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;you have three hundred francs in hand; you can live
      comfortably for three months; very well, then, work hard and write another
      romance. D&rsquo;Arthez and Fulgence will help you with the plot; you will
      improve, you will be a novelist. And I, meanwhile, will enter one of those
      <i>lupanars</i> of thought; for three months I will be a journalist. I
      will sell your books to some bookseller or other by attacking his
      publications; I will write the articles myself; I will get others for you.
      We will organize a success; you shall be a great man, and still remain our
      Lucien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must despise me very much, if you think that I should perish while
      you escape,&rdquo; said the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, forgive him; it is a child!&rdquo; cried Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lucien&rsquo;s intellect had been stimulated by the evenings spent in
      d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s garret, he had made some study of the jokes and articles in the
      smaller newspapers. He was at least the equal, he felt, of the wittiest
      contributors; in private he tried some mental gymnastics of the kind, and
      went out one morning with the triumphant idea of finding some colonel of
      such light skirmishers of the press and enlisting in their ranks. He
      dressed in his best and crossed the bridges, thinking as he went that
      authors, journalists, and men of letters, his future comrades, in short,
      would show him rather more kindness and disinterestedness than the two
      species of booksellers who had so dashed his hopes. He should meet with
      fellow-feeling, and something of the kindly and grateful affection which
      he found in the <i>cenacle</i> of the Rue des Quatre-Vents. Tormented by
      emotion, consequent upon the presentiments to which men of imagination
      cling so fondly, half believing, half battling with their belief in them,
      he arrived in the Rue Saint-Fiacre off the Boulevard Montmartre. Before a
      house, occupied by the offices of a small newspaper, he stopped, and at
      the sight of it his heart began to throb as heavily as the pulses of a
      youth upon the threshold of some evil haunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, upstairs he went, and found the offices in the low <i>entresol</i>
      between the ground floor and the first story. The first room was divided
      down the middle by a partition, the lower half of solid wood, the upper
      lattice work to the ceiling. In this apartment Lucien discovered a
      one-armed pensioner supporting several reams of paper on his head with his
      remaining hand, while between his teeth he held the passbook which the
      Inland Revenue Department requires every newspaper to produce with each
      issue. This ill-favored individual, owner of a yellow countenance covered
      with red excrescences, to which he owed his nickname of &ldquo;Coloquinte,&rdquo;
       indicated a personage behind the lattice as the Cerberus of the paper.
      This was an elderly officer with a medal on his chest and a silk skull-cap
      on his head; his nose was almost hidden by a pair of grizzled moustaches,
      and his person was hidden as completely in an ample blue overcoat as the
      body of the turtle in its carapace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what date do you wish your subscription to commence, sir?&rdquo; inquired
      the Emperor&rsquo;s officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come about a subscription,&rdquo; returned Lucien. Looking about him,
      he saw a placard fastened on a door, corresponding to the one by which he
      had entered, and read the words&mdash;EDITOR&rsquo;S OFFICE, and below, in
      smaller letters, <i>No admittance except on business</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A complaint, I expect?&rdquo; replied the veteran. &ldquo;Ah! yes; we have been hard
      on Mariette. What would you have? I don&rsquo;t know the why and wherefore of it
      yet.&mdash;But if you want satisfaction, I am ready for you,&rdquo; he added,
      glancing at a collection of small arms and foils stacked in a corner, the
      armory of the modern warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was still further from my intention, sir. I have come to speak to
      the editor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is ever here before four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you here, Giroudeau, old chap,&rdquo; remarked a voice, &ldquo;I make it eleven
      columns; eleven columns at five francs apiece is fifty-five francs, and I
      have only been paid forty; so you owe me another fifteen francs, as I have
      been telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words proceeded from a little weasel-face, pallid and
      semi-transparent as the half-boiled white of an egg; two slits of eyes
      looked out of it, mild blue in tint, but appallingly malignant in
      expression; and the owner, an insignificant young man, was completely
      hidden by the veteran&rsquo;s opaque person. It was a blood-curdling voice, a
      sound between the mewing of a cat and the wheezy chokings of a hyena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my little militiaman,&rdquo; retorted he of the medal, &ldquo;but you are
      counting the headings and white lines. I have Finot&rsquo;s instructions to add
      up the totals of the lines, and to divide them by the proper number for
      each column; and after I performed that concentrating operation on your
      copy, there were three columns less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t pay for the blanks, the Jew! He reckons them in though when he
      sends up the total of his work to his partner, and he gets paid for them
      too. I will go and see Etienne Lousteau, Vernou&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot go beyond my orders, my boy,&rdquo; said the veteran. &ldquo;What! do you
      cry out against your foster-mother for a matter of fifteen francs? you
      that turn out an article as easily as I smoke a cigar. Fifteen francs!
      why, you will give a bowl of punch to your friends, or win an extra game
      of billiards, and there&rsquo;s an end of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finot&rsquo;s savings will cost him very dear,&rdquo; said the contributor as he took
      his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, would not anybody think that he was Rousseau and Voltaire rolled in
      one?&rdquo; the cashier remarked to himself as he glanced at Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come in again at four, sir,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the argument proceeded, Lucien had been looking about him. He saw
      upon the walls the portraits of Benjamin Constant, General Foy, and the
      seventeen illustrious orators of the Left, interspersed with caricatures
      at the expense of the Government; but he looked more particularly at the
      door of the sanctuary where, no doubt, the paper was elaborated, the witty
      paper that amused him daily, and enjoyed the privilege of ridiculing kings
      and the most portentous events, of calling anything and everything in
      question with a jest. Then he sauntered along the boulevards. It was an
      entirely novel amusement; and so agreeable did he find it, that, looking
      at the turret clocks, he saw the hour hands were pointing to four, and
      only then remembered that he had not breakfasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went at once in the direction of the Rue Saint-Fiacre, climbed the
      stair, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran officer was absent; but the old pensioner, sitting on a pile
      of stamped papers, was munching a crust and acting as sentinel resignedly.
      Coloquinte was as much accustomed to his work in the office as to the
      fatigue duty of former days, understanding as much or as little about it
      as the why and wherefore of forced marches made by the Emperor&rsquo;s orders.
      Lucien was inspired with the bold idea of deceiving that formidable
      functionary. He settled his hat on his head, and walked into the editor&rsquo;s
      office as if he were quite at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking eagerly about him, he beheld a round table covered with a green
      cloth, and half-a-dozen cherry-wood chairs, newly reseated with straw. The
      colored brick floor had not been waxed, but it was clean; so clean that
      the public, evidently, seldom entered the room. There was a mirror above
      the chimney-piece, and on the ledge below, amid a sprinkling of
      visiting-cards, stood a shopkeeper&rsquo;s clock, smothered with dust, and a
      couple of candlesticks with tallow dips thrust into their sockets. A few
      antique newspapers lay on the table beside an inkstand containing some
      black lacquer-like substance, and a collection of quill pens twisted into
      stars. Sundry dirty scraps of paper, covered with almost undecipherable
      hieroglyphs, proved to be manuscript articles torn across the top by the
      compositor to check off the sheets as they were set up. He admired a few
      rather clever caricatures, sketched on bits of brown paper by somebody who
      evidently had tried to kill time by killing something else to keep his
      hand in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other works of art were pinned in the cheap sea-green wall-paper. These
      consisted of nine pen-and-ink illustrations for <i>Le Solitaire</i>. The
      work had attained to such an unheard-of European popularity, that
      journalists evidently were tired of it.&mdash;&ldquo;The Solitary makes his
      first appearance in the provinces; sensation among the women.&mdash;The
      Solitary perused at a chateau.&mdash;Effect of the Solitary on domestic
      animals.&mdash;The Solitary explained to savage tribes, with the most
      brilliant results.&mdash;The Solitary translated into Chinese and
      presented by the author to the Emperor at Pekin.&mdash;The Mont Sauvage,
      Rape of Elodie.&rdquo;&mdash;(Lucien though this caricature very shocking, but
      he could not help laughing at it.)&mdash;&ldquo;The Solitary under a canopy
      conducted in triumphal procession by the newspapers.&mdash;The Solitary
      breaks the press to splinters, and wounds the printers.&mdash;Read
      backwards, the superior beauties of the Solitary produce a sensation at
      the Academie.&rdquo;&mdash;On a newspaper-wrapper Lucien noticed a sketch of a
      contributor holding out his hat, and beneath it the words, &ldquo;Finot! my
      hundred francs,&rdquo; and a name, since grown more notorious than famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the window and the chimney-piece stood a writing-table, a mahogany
      armchair, and a waste-paper basket on a strip of hearth-rug; the dust lay
      thick on all these objects. There were short curtains in the windows.
      About a score of new books lay on the writing-table, deposited there
      apparently during the day, together with prints, music, snuff-boxes of the
      &ldquo;Charter&rdquo; pattern, a copy of the ninth edition of <i>Le Solitaire</i> (the
      great joke of the moment), and some ten unopened letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had taken stock of this strange furniture, and made reflections of
      the most exhaustive kind upon it, when, the clock striking five, he
      returned to question the pensioner. Coloquinte had finished his crust, and
      was waiting with the patience of a commissionaire, for the man of medals,
      who perhaps was taking an airing on the boulevard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this conjuncture the rustle of a dress sounded on the stair, and the
      light unmistakable footstep of a woman on the threshold. The newcomer was
      passably pretty. She addressed herself to Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know why you cry up Mlle. Virginie&rsquo;s hats so much; and
      I have come to put down my name for a year&rsquo;s subscription in the first
      place; but tell me your conditions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not connected with the paper, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A subscription dating from October?&rdquo; inquired the pensioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the lady want to know?&rdquo; asked the veteran, reappearing on the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair milliner and the retired military man were soon deep in converse;
      and when Lucien, beginning to lose patience, came back to the first room,
      he heard the conclusion of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I shall be delighted, quite delighted, sir. Mlle. Florentine can
      come to my shop and choose anything she likes. Ribbons are in my
      department. So it is all quite settled. You will say no more about
      Virginie, a botcher that cannot design a new shape, while I have ideas of
      my own, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien heard a sound as of coins dropping into a cashbox, and the veteran
      began to make up his books for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting here for an hour, sir,&rdquo; Lucien began, looking not a
      little annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;they&rsquo; have not come yet!&rdquo; exclaimed Napoleon&rsquo;s veteran, civilly
      feigning concern. &ldquo;I am not surprised at that. It is some time since I
      have seen &lsquo;them&rsquo; here. It is the middle of the month, you see. Those fine
      fellows only turn up on pay days&mdash;the 29th or the 30th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And M. Finot?&rdquo; asked Lucien, having caught the editor&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in the Rue Feydeau, that&rsquo;s where he lives. Coloquinte, old chap,
      just take him everything that has come in to-day when you go with the
      paper to the printers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the newspaper put together?&rdquo; Lucien said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspaper?&rdquo; repeated the officer, as he received the rest of the
      stamp money from Coloquinte, &ldquo;the newspaper?&mdash;broum! broum!&mdash;(Mind
      you are round at the printers&rsquo; by six o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, old chap, to send
      off the porters.)&mdash;The newspaper, sir, is written in the street, at
      the writers&rsquo; houses, in the printing-office between eleven and twelve
      o&rsquo;clock at night. In the Emperor&rsquo;s time, sir, these shops for spoiled
      paper were not known. Oh! he would have cleared them out with four men and
      a corporal; they would not have come over <i>him</i> with their talk. But
      that is enough of prattling. If my nephew finds it worth his while, and so
      long as they write for the son of the Other (broum! broum!)&mdash;&mdash;after
      all, there is no harm in that. Ah! by the way, subscribers don&rsquo;t seem to
      me to be advancing in serried columns; I shall leave my post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know all about the newspaper, sir,&rdquo; Lucien began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a business point of view, broum! broum!&rdquo; coughed the soldier,
      clearing his throat. &ldquo;From three to five francs per column, according to
      ability.&mdash;Fifty lines to a column, forty letters to a line; no
      blanks; there you are! As for the staff, they are queer fish, little
      youngsters whom I wouldn&rsquo;t take on for the commissariat; and because they
      make fly tracks on sheets of white paper, they look down, forsooth, on an
      old Captain of Dragoons of the Guard, that retired with a major&rsquo;s rank
      after entering every European capital with Napoleon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier of Napoleon brushed his coat, and made as if he would go out,
      but Lucien, swept to the door, had courage enough to make a stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to be a contributor of the paper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am full of respect,
      I vow and declare, for a captain of the Imperial Guard, those men of
      bronze&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, my little civilian, there are several kinds of contributors;
      which kind do you wish to be?&rdquo; replied the trooper, bearing down on
      Lucien, and descending the stairs. At the foot of the flight he stopped,
      but it was only to light a cigar at the porter&rsquo;s box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any subscribers come, you see them and take note of them, Mother
      Chollet.&mdash;Simply subscribers, never know anything but subscribers,&rdquo;
       he added, seeing that Lucien followed him. &ldquo;Finot is my nephew; he is the
      only one of my family that has done anything to relieve me in my position.
      So when anybody comes to pick a quarrel with Finot, he finds old
      Giroudeau, Captain of the Dragoons of the Guard, that set out as a private
      in a cavalry regiment in the army of the Sambre-et-Meuse, and was
      fencing-master for five years to the First Hussars, army of Italy! One,
      two, and the man that had any complaints to make would be turned off into
      the dark,&rdquo; he added, making a lunge. &ldquo;Now writers, my boy, are in
      different corps; there is the writer who writes and draws his pay; there
      is the writer who writes and gets nothing (a volunteer we call him); and,
      lastly, there is the writer who writes nothing, and he is by no means the
      stupidest, for he makes no mistakes; he gives himself out for a literary
      man, he is on the paper, he treats us to dinners, he loafs about the
      theatres, he keeps an actress, he is very well off. What do you mean to
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that does good work and gets good pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like the recruits. They all want to be marshals of France. Take
      old Giroudeau&rsquo;s word for it, and turn right about, in double-quick time,
      and go and pick up nails in the gutter like that good fellow yonder; you
      can tell by the look of him that he has been in the army.&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it a
      shame that an old soldier who has walked into the jaws of death hundreds
      of times should be picking up old iron in the streets of Paris? Ah! God
      A&rsquo;mighty! &lsquo;twas a shabby trick to desert the Emperor.&mdash;Well, my boy,
      the individual you saw this morning has made his forty francs a month. Are
      you going to do better? And, according to Finot, he is the cleverest man
      on the staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you enlisted in the Sambre-et-Meuse, did they talk about danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Go and see my nephew Finot, a good fellow, as good a fellow as
      you will find, if you can find him, that is, for he is like a fish, always
      on the move. In his way of business, there is no writing, you see, it is
      setting others to write. That sort like gallivanting about with actresses
      better than scribbling on sheets of paper, it seems. Oh! they are queer
      customers, they are. Hope I may have the honor of seeing you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the cashier raised his formidable loaded cane, one of the
      defenders of Germainicus, and walked off, leaving Lucien in the street, as
      much bewildered by this picture of the newspaper world as he had formerly
      been by the practical aspects of literature at Messrs. Vidal and Porchon&rsquo;s
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten several times did Lucien repair to the Rue Feydeau in search of
      Andoche Finot, and ten times he failed to find that gentleman. He went
      first thing in the morning; Finot had not come in. At noon, Finot had gone
      out; he was breakfasting at such and such a cafe. At the cafe, in answer
      to inquiries of the waitress, made after surmounting unspeakable
      repugnance, Lucien heard that Finot had just left the place. Lucien, at
      length tired out, began to regard Finot as a mythical and fabulous
      character; it appeared simpler to waylay Etienne Lousteau at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s.
      That youthful journalist would, doubtless, explain the mysteries that
      enveloped the paper for which he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the day, a hundred times blessed, when Lucien made the acquaintance
      of Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez, he had taken another seat at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s. The two
      friends dined side by side, talking in lowered voices of the higher
      literature, of suggested subjects, and ways of presenting, opening up, and
      developing them. At the present time Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez was correcting the
      manuscript of <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i> He reconstructed whole
      chapters, and wrote the fine passages found therein, as well as the
      magnificent preface, which is, perhaps, the best thing in the book, and
      throws so much light on the work of the young school of literature. One
      day it so happened that Daniel had been waiting for Lucien, who now sat
      with his friend&rsquo;s hand in his own, when he saw Etienne Lousteau turn the
      door-handle. Lucien instantly dropped Daniel&rsquo;s hand, and told the waiter
      that he would dine at his old place by the counter. D&rsquo;Arthez gave Lucien a
      glance of divine kindness, in which reproach was wrapped in forgiveness.
      The glance cut the poet to the quick; he took Daniel&rsquo;s hand and grasped it
      anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an important question of business for me; I will tell you about it
      afterwards,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was in his old place by the time that Lousteau reached the table;
      as the first comer, he greeted his acquaintance; they soon struck up a
      conversation, which grew so lively that Lucien went off in search of the
      manuscript of the <i>Marguerites</i>, while Lousteau finished his dinner.
      He had obtained leave to lay his sonnets before the journalist, and
      mistook the civility of the latter for willingness to find him a
      publisher, or a place on the paper. When Lucien came hurrying back again,
      he saw d&rsquo;Arthez resting an elbow on the table in a corner of the
      restaurant, and knew that his friend was watching him with melancholy
      eyes, but he would not see d&rsquo;Arthez just then; he felt the sharp pangs of
      poverty, the goadings of ambition, and followed Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon the journalist and the neophyte went to the
      Luxembourg, and sat down under the trees in that part of the gardens which
      lies between the broad Avenue de l&rsquo;Observatoire and the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest.
      The Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest at that time was a long morass, bounded by planks and
      market-gardens; the houses were all at the end nearest the Rue de
      Vaugirard; and the walk through the gardens was so little frequented, that
      at the hour when Paris dines, two lovers might fall out and exchange the
      earnest of reconciliation without fear of intruders. The only possible
      spoil-sport was the pensioner on duty at the little iron gate on the Rue
      de l&rsquo;Ouest, if that gray-headed veteran should take it into his head to
      lengthen his monotonous beat. There, on a bench beneath the lime-trees,
      Etienne Lousteau sat and listened to sample-sonnets from the <i>Marguerites</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau, after a two-years&rsquo; apprenticeship, was on the staff of a
      newspaper; he had his foot in the stirrup; he reckoned some of the
      celebrities of the day among his friends; altogether, he was an imposing
      personage in Lucien&rsquo;s eyes. Wherefore, while Lucien untied the string
      about the <i>Marguerites</i>, he judged it necessary to make some sort of
      preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sonnet, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is one of the most difficult forms of
      poetry. It has fallen almost entirely into disuse. No Frenchman can hope
      to rival Petrarch; for the language in which the Italian wrote, being so
      infinitely more pliant than French, lends itself to play of thought which
      our positivism (pardon the use of the expression) rejects. So it seemed to
      me that a volume of sonnets would be something quite new. Victor Hugo has
      appropriated the old, Canalis writes lighter verse, Beranger has
      monopolized songs, Casimir Delavigne has taken tragedy, and Lamartine the
      poetry of meditation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a &lsquo;Classic&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Romantic&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s astonishment betrayed such complete ignorance of the state of
      affairs in the republic of letters, that Lousteau thought it necessary to
      enlighten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come up in the middle of a pitched battle, my dear fellow; you
      must make your decision at once. Literature is divided, in the first
      place, into several zones, but our great men are ranged in two hostile
      camps. The Royalists are &lsquo;Romantics,&rsquo; the Liberals are &lsquo;Classics.&rsquo; The
      divergence of taste in matters literary and divergence of political
      opinion coincide; and the result is a war with weapons of every sort,
      double-edged witticisms, subtle calumnies and nicknames <i>a outrance</i>,
      between the rising and the waning glory, and ink is shed in torrents. The
      odd part of it is that the Royalist-Romantics are all for liberty in
      literature, and for repealing laws and conventions; while the
      Liberal-Classics are for maintaining the unities, the Alexandrine, and the
      classical theme. So opinions in politics on either side are directly at
      variance with literary taste. If you are eclectic, you will have no one
      for you. Which side do you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the winning side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Liberal newspapers have far more subscribers than the Royalist and
      Ministerial journals; still, though Canalis is for Church and King, and
      patronized by the Court and the clergy, he reaches other readers.&mdash;Pshaw!
      sonnets date back to an epoch before Boileau&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said Etienne, seeing
      Lucien&rsquo;s dismay at the prospect of choosing between two banners. &ldquo;Be a
      Romantic. The Romantics are young men, and the Classics are pedants; the
      Romantics will gain the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;pedant&rdquo; was the latest epithet taken up by Romantic journalism
      to heap confusion on the Classical faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien began to read, choosing first of all the title-sonnets.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               EASTER DAISIES.

  The daisies in the meadows, not in vain,
  In red and white and gold before our eyes,
  Have written an idyll for man&rsquo;s sympathies,
  And set his heart&rsquo;s desire in language plain.

  Gold stamens set in silver filigrane
  Reveal the treasures which we idolize;
  And all the cost of struggle for the prize
  Is symboled by a secret blood-red stain.

  Was it because your petals once uncurled
  When Jesus rose upon a fairer world,
  And from wings shaken for a heav&rsquo;nward flight
  Shed grace, that still as autumn reappears
  You bloom again to tell of dead delight,
  To bring us back the flower of twenty years?
</pre>
    <p>
      Lucien felt piqued by Lousteau&rsquo;s complete indifference during the reading
      of the sonnet; he was unfamiliar as yet with the disconcerting
      impassibility of the professional critic, wearied by much reading of
      poetry, prose, and plays. Lucien was accustomed to applause. He choked
      down his disappointment and read another, a favorite with Mme. de Bargeton
      and with some of his friends in the Rue des Quatre-Vents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one, perhaps, will draw a word from him,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               THE MARGUERITE.

  I am the Marguerite, fair and tall I grew
  In velvet meadows, &lsquo;mid the flowers a star.
  They sought me for my beauty near and far;
  My dawn, I thought, should be for ever new.
  But now an all unwished-for gift I rue,
  A fatal ray of knowledge shed to mar
  My radiant star-crown grown oracular,
  For I must speak and give an answer true.
  An end of silence and of quiet days,
  The Lover with two words my counsel prays;
  And when my secret from my heart is reft,
  When all my silver petals scattered lie,
  I am the only flower neglected left,
  Cast down and trodden under foot to die.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the end, the poet looked up at his Aristarchus. Etienne Lousteau was
      gazing at the trees in the Pepiniere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, go on! I am listening to you, am I not? That fact
      in itself is as good as praise in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough?&rdquo; Lucien asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the other answered abruptly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien proceeded to read the following sonnet, but his heart was dead
      within him; Lousteau&rsquo;s inscrutable composure froze his utterance. If he
      had come a little further upon the road, he would have known that between
      writer and writer silence or abrupt speech, under such circumstances, is a
      betrayal of jealousy, and outspoken admiration means a sense of relief
      over the discovery that the work is not above the average after all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               THE CAMELLIA.

  In Nature&rsquo;s book, if rightly understood,
  The rose means love, and red for beauty glows;
  A pure, sweet spirit in the violet blows,
  And bright the lily gleams in lowlihood.

  But this strange bloom, by sun and wind unwooed,
  Seems to expand and blossom &lsquo;mid the snows,
  A lily sceptreless, a scentless rose,
  For dainty listlessness of maidenhood.

  Yet at the opera house the petals trace
  For modesty a fitting aureole;
  An alabaster wreath to lay, methought,
  In dusky hair o&rsquo;er some fair woman&rsquo;s face
  Which kindles ev&rsquo;n such love within the soul
  As sculptured marble forms by Phidias wrought.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my poor sonnets?&rdquo; Lucien asked, coming straight to
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am young enough to like the truth, and so anxious to succeed that I can
      hear it without taking offence, but not without despair,&rdquo; replied Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, the first sonnet, from its involved style, was
      evidently written at Angouleme; it gave you so much trouble, no doubt,
      that you cannot give it up. The second and third smack of Paris already;
      but read us one more sonnet,&rdquo; he added, with a gesture that seemed
      charming to the provincial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by the request, Lucien read with more confidence, choosing a
      sonnet which d&rsquo;Arthez and Bridau liked best, perhaps on account of its
      color.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               THE TULIP.

  I am the Tulip from Batavia&rsquo;s shore;
  The thrifty Fleming for my beauty rare
  Pays a king&rsquo;s ransom, when that I am fair,
  And tall, and straight, and pure my petal&rsquo;s core.

  And, like some Yolande of the days of yore,
  My long and amply folded skirts I wear,
  O&rsquo;er-painted with the blazon that I bear
  &mdash;Gules, a fess azure; purpure, fretty, or.

  The fingers of the Gardener divine
  Have woven for me my vesture fair and fine,
  Of threads of sunlight and of purple stain;
  No flower so glorious in the garden bed,
  But Nature, woe is me, no fragrance shed
  Within my cup of Orient porcelain.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Lucien after a pause, immeasurably long, as it seemed to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Etienne said, gravely surveying the tips of Lucien&rsquo;s
      boots (he had brought the pair from Angouleme, and was wearing them out).
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I strongly recommend you to put your ink on your boots to
      save blacking, and to take your pens for toothpicks, so that when you come
      away from Flicoteaux&rsquo;s you can swagger along this picturesque alley
      looking as if you had dined. Get a situation of any sort or description.
      Run errands for a bailiff if you have the heart, be a shopman if your back
      is strong enough, enlist if you happen to have a taste for military music.
      You have the stuff of three poets in you; but before you can reach your
      public, you will have time to die of starvation six times over, if you
      intend to live on the proceeds of your poetry, that is. And from your too
      unsophisticated discourse, it would seem to be your intention to coin
      money out of your inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing as to your verses; they are a good deal better than all the
      poetical wares that are cumbering the ground in booksellers&rsquo; backshops
      just now. Elegant &lsquo;nightingales&rsquo; of that sort cost a little more than the
      others, because they are printed on hand-made paper, but they nearly all
      of them come down at last to the banks of the Seine. You may study their
      range of notes there any day if you care to make an instructive pilgrimage
      along the Quais from old Jerome&rsquo;s stall by the Pont Notre Dame to the Pont
      Royal. You will find them all there&mdash;all the <i>Essays in Verse</i>,
      the <i>Inspirations</i>, the lofty flights, the hymns, and songs, and
      ballads, and odes; all the nestfuls hatched during the last seven years,
      in fact. There lie their muses, thick with dust, bespattered by every
      passing cab, at the mercy of every profane hand that turns them over to
      look at the vignette on the title-page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nobody; you have access to no newspaper, so your <i>Marguerites</i>
      will remain demurely folded as you hold them now. They will never open out
      to the sun of publicity in fair fields with broad margins enameled with
      the florets which Dauriat the illustrious, the king of the Wooden
      Galleries, scatters with a lavish hand for poets known to fame. I came to
      Paris as you came, poor boy, with a plentiful stock of illusions, impelled
      by irrepressible longings for glory&mdash;and I found the realities of the
      craft, the practical difficulties of the trade, the hard facts of poverty.
      In my enthusiasm (it is kept well under control now), my first ebullition
      of youthful spirits, I did not see the social machinery at work; so I had
      to learn to see it by bumping against the wheels and bruising myself
      against the shafts, and chains. Now you are about to learn, as I learned,
      that between you and all these fair dreamed-of things lies the strife of
      men, and passions, and necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willy-nilly, you must take part in a terrible battle; book against book,
      man against man, party against party; make war you must, and that
      systematically, or you will be abandoned by your own party. And they are
      mean contests; struggles which leave you disenchanted, and wearied, and
      depraved, and all in pure waste; for it often happens that you put forth
      all your strength to win laurels for a man whom you despise, and maintain,
      in spite of yourself, that some second-rate writer is a genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a world behind the scenes in the theatre of literature. The
      public in front sees unexpected or well-deserved success, and applauds;
      the public does <i>not</i> see the preparations, ugly as they always are,
      the painted supers, the <i>claqueurs</i> hired to applaud, the stage
      carpenters, and all that lies behind the scenes. You are still among the
      audience. Abdicate, there is still time, before you set your foot on the
      lowest step of the throne for which so many ambitious spirits are
      contending, and do not sell your honor, as I do, for a livelihood.&rdquo;
       Etienne&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how I make a living?&rdquo; he continued passionately. &ldquo;The little
      stock of money they gave me at home was soon eaten up. A piece of mine was
      accepted at the Theatre-Francais just as I came to an end of it. At the
      Theatre-Francais the influence of a first gentleman of the bedchamber, or
      of a prince of the blood, would not be enough to secure a turn of favor;
      the actors only make concessions to those who threaten their self-love. If
      it is in your power to spread a report that the <i>jeune premier</i> has
      the asthma, the leading lady a fistula where you please, and the soubrette
      has foul breath, then your piece would be played to-morrow. I do not know
      whether in two years&rsquo; time, I who speak to you now, shall be in a position
      to exercise such power. You need so many to back you. And where and how am
      I to gain my bread meanwhile?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried lots of things; I wrote a novel, anonymously; old Doguereau gave
      me two hundred francs for it, and he did not make very much out of it
      himself. Then it grew plain to me that journalism alone could give me a
      living. The next thing was to find my way into those shops. I will not
      tell you all the advances I made, nor how often I begged in vain. I will
      say nothing of the six months I spent as extra hand on a paper, and was
      told that I scared subscribers away, when as a fact I attracted them. Pass
      over the insults I put up with. At this moment I am doing the plays at the
      Boulevard theatres, almost <i>gratis</i>, for a paper belonging to Finot,
      that stout young fellow who breakfasts two or three times a month, even
      now, at the Cafe Voltaire (but you don&rsquo;t go there). I live by selling
      tickets that managers give me to bribe a good word in the paper, and
      reviewers&rsquo; copies of books. In short, Finot once satisfied, I am allowed
      to write for and against various commercial articles, and I traffic in
      tribute paid in kind by various tradesmen. A facetious notice of a
      Carminative Toilet Lotion, <i>Pate des Sultanes</i>, Cephalic Oil, or
      Brazilian Mixture brings me in twenty or thirty francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to dun the publishers when they don&rsquo;t send in a sufficient
      number of reviewers&rsquo; copies; Finot, as editor, appropriates two and sells
      them, and I must have two to sell. If a book of capital importance comes
      out, and the publisher is stingy with copies, his life is made a burden to
      him. The craft is vile, but I live by it, and so do scores of others. Do
      not imagine that things are any better in public life. There is corruption
      everywhere in both regions; every man is corrupt or corrupts others. If
      there is any publishing enterprise somewhat larger than usual afoot, the
      trade will pay me something to buy neutrality. The amount of my income
      varies, therefore, directly with the prospectuses. When prospectuses break
      out like a rash, money pours into my pockets; I stand treat all round.
      When trade is dull, I dine at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actresses will pay you likewise for praise, but the wiser among them pay
      for criticism. To be passed over in silence is what they dread the most;
      and the very best thing of all, from their point of view, is criticism
      which draws down a reply; it is far more effectual than bald praise,
      forgotten as soon as read, and it costs more in consequence. Celebrity, my
      dear fellow, is based upon controversy. I am a hired bravo; I ply my trade
      among ideas and reputations, commercial, literary, and dramatic; I make
      some fifty crowns a month; I can sell a novel for five hundred francs; and
      I am beginning to be looked upon as a man to be feared. Some day, instead
      of living with Florine at the expense of a druggist who gives himself the
      airs of a lord, I shall be in a house of my own; I shall be on the staff
      of a leading newspaper, I shall have a <i>feuilleton</i>; and on that day,
      my dear fellow, Florine will become a great actress. As for me, I am not
      sure what I shall be when that time comes, a minister or an honest man&mdash;all
      things are still possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his humiliated head, and looked out at the green leaves, with an
      expression of despairing self-condemnation dreadful to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had a great tragedy accepted!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And among my papers
      there is a poem, which will die. And I was a good fellow, and my heart was
      clean! I used to dream lofty dreams of love for great ladies, queens in
      the great world; and&mdash;my mistress is an actress at the
      Panorama-Dramatique. And lastly, if a bookseller declines to send a copy
      of a book to my paper, I will run down work which is good, as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was moved to tears, and he grasped Etienne&rsquo;s hand in his. The
      journalist rose to his feet, and the pair went up and down the broad
      Avenue de l&rsquo;Observatoire, as if their lungs craved ampler breathing space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside the world of letters,&rdquo; Etienne Lousteau continued, &ldquo;not a single
      creature suspects that every one who succeeds in that world&mdash;who has
      a certain vogue, that is to say, or comes into fashion, or gains
      reputation, or renown, or fame, or favor with the public (for by these
      names we know the rungs of the ladder by which we climb to the higher
      heights above and beyond them),&mdash;every one who comes even thus far is
      the hero of a dreadful Odyssey. Brilliant portents rise above the mental
      horizon through a combination of a thousand accidents; conditions change
      so swiftly that no two men have been known to reach success by the same
      road. Canalis and Nathan are two dissimilar cases; things never fall out
      in the same way twice. There is d&rsquo;Arthez, who knocks himself to pieces
      with work&mdash;he will make a famous name by some other chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This so much desired reputation is nearly always crowned prostitution.
      Yes; the poorest kind of literature is the hapless creature freezing at
      the street corner; second-rate literature is the kept-mistress picked out
      of the brothels of journalism, and I am her bully; lastly, there is lucky
      literature, the flaunting, insolent courtesan who has a house of her own
      and pays taxes, who receives great lords, treating or ill-treating them as
      she pleases, who has liveried servants and a carriage, and can afford to
      keep greedy creditors waiting. Ah! and for yet others, for me not so very
      long ago, for you to-day&mdash;she is a white-robed angel with
      many-colored wings, bearing a green palm branch in the one hand, and in
      the other a flaming sword. An angel, something akin to the mythological
      abstraction which lives at the bottom of a well, and to the poor and
      honest girl who lives a life of exile in the outskirts of the great city,
      earning every penny with a noble fortitude and in the full light of
      virtue, returning to heaven inviolate of body and soul; unless, indeed,
      she comes to lie at the last, soiled, despoiled, polluted, and forgotten,
      on a pauper&rsquo;s bier. As for the men whose brains are encompassed with
      bronze, whose hearts are still warm under the snows of experience, they
      are found but seldom in the country that lies at our feet,&rdquo; he added,
      pointing to the great city seething in the late afternoon light.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vision of d&rsquo;Arthez and his friends flashed upon Lucien&rsquo;s sight, and made
      appeal to him for a moment; but Lousteau&rsquo;s appalling lamentation carried
      him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very few and far between in that great fermenting vat; rare as
      love in love-making, rare as fortunes honestly made in business, rare as
      the journalist whose hands are clean. The experience of the first man who
      told me all that I am telling you was thrown away upon me, and mine no
      doubt will be wasted upon you. It is always the same old story year after
      year; the same eager rush to Paris from the provinces; the same, not to
      say a growing, number of beardless, ambitious boys, who advance, head
      erect, and the heart that Princess Tourandocte of the <i>Mille et un Jours</i>&mdash;each
      one of them fain to be her Prince Calaf. But never a one of them reads the
      riddle. One by one they drop, some into the trench where failures lie,
      some into the mire of journalism, some again into the quagmires of the
      book-trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They pick up a living, these beggars, what with biographical notices,
      penny-a-lining, and scraps of news for the papers. They become
      booksellers&rsquo; hacks for the clear-headed dealers in printed paper, who
      would sooner take the rubbish that goes off in a fortnight than a
      masterpiece which requires time to sell. The life is crushed out of the
      grubs before they reach the butterfly stage. They live by shame and
      dishonor. They are ready to write down a rising genius or to praise him to
      the skies at a word from the pasha of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, the <i>Quotidienne</i>,
      or the <i>Debats</i>, at a sign from a publisher, at the request of a
      jealous comrade, or (as not seldom happens) simply for a dinner. Some
      surmount the obstacles, and these forget the misery of their early days.
      I, who am telling you this, have been putting the best that is in me into
      newspaper articles for six months past for a blackguard who gives them out
      as his own and has secured a <i>feuilleton</i> in another paper on the
      strength of them. He has not taken me on as his collaborator, he has not
      give me so much as a five-franc piece, but I hold out a hand to grasp his
      when we meet; I cannot help myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; Lucien, asked, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may want to put a dozen lines into his <i>feuilleton</i> some day,&rdquo;
       Lousteau answered coolly. &ldquo;In short, my dear fellow, in literature you
      will not make money by hard work, that is not the secret of success; the
      point is to exploit the work of somebody else. A newspaper proprietor is a
      contractor, we are the bricklayers. The more mediocre the man, the better
      his chance of getting on among mediocrities; he can play the toad-eater,
      put up with any treatment, and flatter all the little base passions of the
      sultans of literature. There is Hector Merlin, who came from Limoges a
      short time ago; he is writing political articles already for a Right
      Centre daily, and he is at work on our little paper as well. I have seen
      an editor drop his hat and Merlin pick it up. The fellow was careful never
      to give offence, and slipped into the thick of the fight between rival
      ambitions. I am sorry for you. It is as if I saw in you the self that I
      used to be, and sure am I that in one or two years&rsquo; time you will be what
      I am now.&mdash;You will think that there is some lurking jealousy or
      personal motive in this bitter counsel, but it is prompted by the despair
      of a damned soul that can never leave hell.&mdash;No one ventures to utter
      such things as these. You hear the groans of anguish from a man wounded to
      the heart, crying like a second Job from the ashes, &lsquo;Behold my sores!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whether I fight upon this field or elsewhere, fight I must,&rdquo; said
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, be sure of this,&rdquo; returned Lousteau, &ldquo;if you have anything in you,
      the war will know no truce, the best chance of success lies in an empty
      head. The austerity of your conscience, clear as yet, will relax when you
      see that a man holds your future in his two hands, when a word from such a
      man means life to you, and he will not say that word. For, believe me, the
      most brutal bookseller in the trade is not so insolent, so hard-hearted to
      a newcomer as the celebrity of the day. The bookseller sees a possible
      loss of money, while the writer of books dreads a possible rival; the
      first shows you the door, the second crushes the life out of you. To do
      really good work, my boy, means that you will draw out the energy, sap,
      and tenderness of your nature at every dip of the pen in the ink, to set
      it forth for the world in passion and sentiment and phrases. Yes; instead
      of acting, you will write; you will sing songs instead of fighting; you
      will love and hate and live in your books; and then, after all, when you
      shall have reserved your riches for your style, your gold and purple for
      your characters, and you yourself are walking the streets of Paris in
      rags, rejoicing in that, rivaling the State Register, you have authorized
      the existence of beings styled Adolphe, Corinne or Clarissa, Rene or
      Manon; when you shall have spoiled your life and your digestion to give
      life to that creation, then you shall see it slandered, betrayed, sold,
      swept away into the back waters of oblivion by journalists, and buried out
      of sight by your best friends. How can you afford to wait until the day
      when your creation shall rise again, raised from the dead&mdash;how? when?
      and by whom? Take a magnificent book, the <i>pianto</i> of unbelief; <i>Obermann</i>
      is a solitary wanderer in the desert places of booksellers&rsquo; warehouses, he
      has been a &lsquo;nightingale,&rsquo; ironically so called, from the very beginning:
      when will his Easter come? Who knows? Try, to begin with, to find somebody
      bold enough to print the <i>Marguerites</i>; not to pay for them, but
      simply to print them; and you will see some queer things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fierce tirade, delivered in every tone of the passionate feeling which
      it expressed, fell upon Lucien&rsquo;s spirit like an avalanche, and left a
      sense of glacial cold. For one moment he stood silent; then, as he felt
      the terrible stimulating charm of difficulty beginning to work upon him,
      his courage blazed up. He grasped Lousteau&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will triumph!&rdquo; he cried aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;one more Christian given over to the wild beasts
      in the arena.&mdash;There is a first-night performance at the
      Panorama-Dramatique, my dear fellow; it doesn&rsquo;t begin till eight, so you
      can change your coat, come properly dressed in fact, and call for me. I am
      living on the fourth floor above the Cafe Servel, Rue de la Harpe. We will
      go to Dauriat&rsquo;s first of all. You still mean to go on, do you not? Very
      well, I will introduce you to one of the kings of the trade to-night, and
      to one or two journalists. We will sup with my mistress and several
      friends after the play, for you cannot count that dinner as a meal. Finot
      will be there, editor and proprietor of my paper. As Minette says in the
      Vaudeville (do you remember?), &lsquo;Time is a great lean creature.&rsquo; Well, for
      the like of us, Chance is a great lean creature, and must be tempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remember this day as long as I live,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring your manuscript with you, and be careful of your dress, not on
      Florine&rsquo;s account, but for the booksellers&rsquo; benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comrade&rsquo;s good-nature, following upon the poet&rsquo;s passionate outcry, as
      he described the war of letters, moved Lucien quite as deeply as
      d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s grave and earnest words on a former occasion. The prospect of
      entering at once upon the strife with men warmed him. In his youth and
      inexperience he had no suspicion how real were the moral evils denounced
      by the journalist. Nor did he know that he was standing at the parting of
      two distinct ways, between two systems, represented by the brotherhood
      upon one hand, and journalism upon the other. The first way was long,
      honorable, and sure; the second beset with hidden dangers, a perilous
      path, among muddy channels where conscience is inevitably bespattered. The
      bent of Lucien&rsquo;s character determined for the shorter way, and the
      apparently pleasanter way, and to snatch at the quickest and promptest
      means. At this moment he saw no difference between d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s noble
      friendship and Lousteau&rsquo;s easy comaraderie; his inconstant mind discerned
      a new weapon in journalism; he felt that he could wield it, so he wished
      to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dazzled by the offers of this new friend, who had struck a hand in
      his in an easy way, which charmed Lucien. How should he know that while
      every man in the army of the press needs friends, every leader needs men.
      Lousteau, seeing that Lucien was resolute, enlisted him as a recruit, and
      hoped to attach him to himself. The relative positions of the two were
      similar&mdash;one hoped to become a corporal, the other to enter the
      ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went back gaily to his lodgings. He was as careful over his toilet
      as on that former unlucky occasion when he occupied the Marquise
      d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s box; but he had learned by this time how to wear his clothes
      with a better grace. They looked as though they belonged to him. He wore
      his best tightly-fitting, light-colored trousers, and a dress-coat. His
      boots, a very elegant pair adorned with tassels, had cost him forty
      francs. His thick, fine, golden hair was scented and crimped into bright,
      rippling curls. Self-confidence and belief in his future lighted up his
      forehead. He paid careful attention to his almost feminine hands, the
      filbert nails were a spotless pink, and the white contours of his chin
      were dazzling by contrast with a black satin stock. Never did a more
      beautiful youth come down from the hills of the Latin Quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious as a Greek god, Lucien took a cab, and reached the Cafe Servel at
      a quarter to seven. There the portress gave him some tolerably complicated
      directions for the ascent of four pairs of stairs. Provided with these
      instructions, he discovered, not without difficulty, an open door at the
      end of a long, dark passage, and in another moment made the acquaintance
      of the traditional room of the Latin Quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man&rsquo;s poverty follows him wherever he goes&mdash;into the Rue de
      la Harpe as into the Rue de Cluny, into d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s room, into Chrestien&rsquo;s
      lodging; yet everywhere no less the poverty has its own peculiar
      characteristics, due to the idiosyncrasies of the sufferer. Poverty in
      this case wore a sinister look.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shabby, cheap carpet lay in wrinkles at the foot of a curtainless
      walnut-wood bedstead; dingy curtains, begrimed with cigar smoke and fumes
      from a smoky chimney, hung in the windows; a Carcel lamp, Florine&rsquo;s gift,
      on the chimney-piece, had so far escaped the pawnbroker. Add a
      forlorn-looking chest of drawers, and a table littered with papers and
      disheveled quill pens, and the list of furniture was almost complete. All
      the books had evidently arrived in the course of the last twenty-four
      hours; and there was not a single object of any value in the room. In one
      corner you beheld a collection of crushed and flattened cigars, coiled
      pocket-handkerchiefs, shirts which had been turned to do double duty, and
      cravats that had reached a third edition; while a sordid array of old
      boots stood gaping in another angle of the room among aged socks worn into
      lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, in short, was a journalist&rsquo;s bivouac, filled with odds and ends
      of no value, and the most curiously bare apartment imaginable. A scarlet
      tinder-box glowed among a pile of books on the nightstand. A brace of
      pistols, a box of cigars, and a stray razor lay upon the mantel-shelf; a
      pair of foils, crossed under a wire mask, hung against a panel. Three
      chairs and a couple of armchairs, scarcely fit for the shabbiest
      lodging-house in the street, completed the inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dirty, cheerless room told a tale of a restless life and a want of
      self-respect; some one came hither to sleep and work at high pressure,
      staying no longer than he could help, longing, while he remained, to be
      out and away. What a difference between this cynical disorder and
      d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s neat and self-respecting poverty! A warning came with the
      thought of d&rsquo;Arthez; but Lucien would not heed it, for Etienne made a
      joking remark to cover the nakedness of a reckless life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my kennel; I appear in state in the Rue de Bondy, in the new
      apartments which our druggist has taken for Florine; we hold the
      house-warming this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau wore black trousers and beautifully-varnished boots; his
      coat was buttoned up to his chin; he probably meant to change his linen at
      Florine&rsquo;s house, for his shirt collar was hidden by a velvet stock. He was
      trying to renovate his hat by an application of the brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I am waiting for a bookseller to bring me some money; I have not
      a farthing; there will be play, perhaps, and in any case I must have
      gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the two new friends heard a man&rsquo;s step in the passage
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Now you will see, my dear fellow, the shape
      that Providence takes when he manifests himself to poets. You are going to
      behold Dauriat, the fashionable bookseller of the Quai des Augustins, the
      pawnbroker, the marine store dealer of the trade, the Norman
      ex-greengrocer.&mdash;Come along, old Tartar!&rdquo; shouted Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo; said a voice like a cracked bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought the money with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money? There is no money now in the trade,&rdquo; retorted the other, a young
      man who eyed Lucien curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Imprimis</i>, you owe me fifty francs,&rdquo; Lousteau continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two copies of <i>Travels in Egypt</i> here, a marvel, so they
      say, swarming with woodcuts, sure to sell. Finot has been paid for two
      reviews that I am to write for him. <i>Item</i> two works, just out, by
      Victor Ducange, a novelist highly thought of in the Marais. <i>Item</i> a
      couple of copies of a second work by Paul de Kock, a beginner in the same
      style. <i>Item</i> two copies of <i>Yseult of Dole</i>, a charming
      provincial work. Total, one hundred francs, my little Barbet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbet made a close survey of edges and binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they are in perfect condition,&rdquo; cried Lousteau. &ldquo;The <i>Travels</i>
      are uncut, so is the Paul de Kock, so is the Ducange, so is that other
      thing on the chimney-piece, <i>Considerations on Symbolism</i>. I will
      throw that in; myths weary me to that degree that I will let you have the
      thing to spare myself the sight of the swarms of mites coming out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Lucien, &ldquo;how are you going to write your reviews?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbet, in profound astonishment, stared at Lucien; then he looked at
      Etienne and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see that the gentleman has not the misfortune to be a literary
      man,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Barbet&mdash;no. He is a poet, a great poet; he is going to cut out
      Canalis, and Beranger, and Delavigne. He will go a long way if he does not
      throw himself into the river, and even so he will get as far as the
      drag-nets at Saint-Cloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had any advice to give the gentleman,&rdquo; remarked Barbet, &ldquo;it would be
      to give up poetry and take to prose. Poetry is not wanted on the Quais
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbet&rsquo;s shabby overcoat was fastened by a single button; his collar was
      greasy; he kept his hat on his head as he spoke; he wore low shoes, an
      open waistcoat gave glimpses of a homely shirt of coarse linen.
      Good-nature was not wanting in the round countenance, with its two slits
      of covetous eyes; but there was likewise the vague uneasiness habitual to
      those who have money to spend and hear constant applications for it. Yet,
      to all appearance, he was plain-dealing and easy-natured, his business
      shrewdness was so well wadded round with fat. He had been an assistant
      until he took a wretched little shop on the Quai des Augustins two years
      since, and issued thence on his rounds among journalists, authors, and
      printers, buying up free copies cheaply, making in such ways some ten or
      twenty francs daily. Now, he had money saved; he knew instinctively where
      every man was pressed; he had a keen eye for business. If an author was in
      difficulties, he would discount a bill given by a publisher at fifteen or
      twenty per cent; then the next day he would go to the publisher, haggle
      over the price of some work in demand, and pay him with his own bills
      instead of cash. Barbet was something of a scholar; he had had just enough
      education to make him careful to steer clear of modern poetry and modern
      romances. He had a liking for small speculations, for books of a popular
      kind which might be bought outright for a thousand francs and exploited at
      pleasure, such as the <i>Child&rsquo;s History of France</i>, <i>Book-keeping in
      Twenty Lessons</i>, and <i>Botany for Young Ladies</i>. Two or three times
      already he had allowed a good book to slip through his fingers; the
      authors had come and gone a score of times while he hesitated, and could
      not make up his mind to buy the manuscript. When reproached for his
      pusillanimity, he was wont to produce the account of a notorious trial
      taken from the newspapers; it cost him nothing, and had brought him in two
      or three thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbet was the type of bookseller that goes in fear and trembling; lives
      on bread and walnuts; rarely puts his name to a bill; filches little
      profits on invoices; makes deductions, and hawks his books about himself;
      heaven only knows where they go, but he sells them somehow, and gets paid
      for them. Barbet was the terror of printers, who could not tell what to
      make of him; he paid cash and took off the discount; he nibbled at their
      invoices whenever he thought they were pressed for money; and when he had
      fleeced a man once, he never went back to him&mdash;he feared to be caught
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;shall we go on with our business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! my boy,&rdquo; returned Barbet in a familiar tone; &ldquo;I have six thousand
      volumes of stock on hand at my place, and paper is not gold, as the old
      bookseller said. Trade is dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you went into his shop, my dear Lucien,&rdquo; said Etienne, turning to his
      friend, &ldquo;you would see an oak counter from some bankrupt wine merchant&rsquo;s
      sale, and a tallow dip, never snuffed for fear it should burn too quickly,
      making darkness visible. By that anomalous light you descry rows of empty
      shelves with some difficulty. An urchin in a blue blouse mounts guard over
      the emptiness, and blows his fingers, and shuffles his feet, and slaps his
      chest, like a cabman on the box. Just look about you! there are no more
      books there than I have here. Nobody could guess what kind of shop he
      keeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a bill at three months for a hundred francs,&rdquo; said Barbet, and he
      could not help smiling as he drew it out of his pocket; &ldquo;I will take your
      old books off your hands. I can&rsquo;t pay cash any longer, you see; sales are
      too slow. I thought that you would be wanting me; I had not a penny, and I
      made a bill simply to oblige you, for I am not fond of giving my
      signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you want my thanks and esteem into the bargain, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bills are not met with sentiment,&rdquo; responded Barbet; &ldquo;but I will accept
      your esteem, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want gloves, and the perfumers will be base enough to decline your
      paper,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Stop, there is a superb engraving in the top
      drawer of the chest there, worth eighty francs, proof before letters and
      after letterpress, for I have written a pretty droll article upon it.
      There was something to lay hold of in <i>Hippocrates refusing the Presents
      of Artaxerxes</i>. A fine engraving, eh? Just the thing to suit all the
      doctors, who are refusing the extravagant gifts of Parisian satraps. You
      will find two or three dozen novels underneath it. Come, now, take the lot
      and give me forty francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Forty francs</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the bookseller, emitting a cry like the
      squall of a frightened fowl. &ldquo;Twenty at the very most! And then I may
      never see the money again,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your twenty francs?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, I don&rsquo;t know that I have them,&rdquo; said Barbet, fumbling in his
      pockets. &ldquo;Here they are. You are plundering me; you have an ascendency
      over me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us be off,&rdquo; said Lousteau, and taking up Lucien&rsquo;s manuscript,
      he drew a line upon it in ink under the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything else?&rdquo; asked Barbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, you young Shylock. I am going to put you in the way of a bit of
      very good business,&rdquo; Etienne continued (&ldquo;in which you shall lose a
      thousand crowns, to teach you to rob me in this fashion&rdquo;), he added for
      Lucien&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about your reviews?&rdquo; said Lucien, as they rolled away to the
      Palais Royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! you do not know how reviews are knocked off. As for the <i>Travels
      in Egypt</i>, I looked into the book here and there (without cutting the
      pages), and I found eleven slips in grammar. I shall say that the writer
      may have mastered the dicky-bird language on the flints that they call
      &lsquo;obelisks&rsquo; out there in Egypt, but he cannot write in his own, as I will
      prove to him in a column and a half. I shall say that instead of giving us
      the natural history and archaeology, he ought to have interested himself
      in the future of Egypt, in the progress of civilization, and the best
      method of strengthening the bond between Egypt and France. France has won
      and lost Egypt, but she may yet attach the country to her interests by
      gaining a moral ascendency over it. Then some patriotic penny-a-lining,
      interlarded with diatribes on Marseilles, the Levant and our trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose that he had taken that view, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, I should say that instead of boring us with politics, he should
      have written about art, and described the picturesque aspects of the
      country and the local color. Then the critic bewails himself. Politics are
      intruded everywhere; we are weary of politics&mdash;politics on all sides.
      I should regret those charming books of travel that dwelt upon the
      difficulties of navigation, the fascination of steering between two rocks,
      the delights of crossing the line, and all the things that those who never
      will travel ought to know. Mingle this approval with scoffing at the
      travelers who hail the appearance of a bird or a flying-fish as a great
      event, who dilate upon fishing, and make transcripts from the log. Where,
      you ask, is that perfectly unintelligible scientific information,
      fascinating, like all that is profound, mysterious, and incomprehensible.
      The reader laughs, that is all that he wants. As for novels, Florine is
      the greatest novel reader alive; she gives me a synopsis, and I take her
      opinion and put a review together. When a novelist bores her with
      &lsquo;author&rsquo;s stuff,&rsquo; as she calls it, I treat the work respectfully, and ask
      the publisher for another copy, which he sends forthwith, delighted to
      have a favorable review.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness! and what of criticism, the critic&rsquo;s sacred office?&rdquo; cried
      Lucien, remembering the ideas instilled into him by the brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;criticism is a kind of brush which must
      not be used upon flimsy stuff, or it carries it all away with it. That is
      enough of the craft, now listen! Do you see that mark?&rdquo; he continued,
      pointing to the manuscript of the <i>Marguerites</i>. &ldquo;I have put ink on
      the string and paper. If Dauriat reads your manuscript, he certainly could
      not tie the string and leave it just as it was before. So your book is
      sealed, so to speak. This is not useless to you for the experiment that
      you propose to make. And another thing: please to observe that you are not
      arriving quite alone and without a sponsor in the place, like the
      youngsters who make the round of half-a-score of publishers before they
      find one that will offer them a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s experience confirmed the truth of this particular. Lousteau paid
      the cabman, giving him three francs&mdash;a piece of prodigality following
      upon such impecuniosity astonishing Lucien more than a little. Then the
      two friends entered the Wooden Galleries, where fashionable literature, as
      it is called, used to reign in state.

    <h2>
      PART II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Wooden Galleries of the Palais Royal used to be one of the most famous
      sights of Paris. Some description of the squalid bazar will not be out of
      place; for there are few men of forty who will not take an interest in
      recollections of a state of things which will seem incredible to a younger
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great dreary, spacious Galerie d&rsquo;Orleans, that flowerless hothouse, as
      yet was not; the space upon which it now stands was covered with booths;
      or, to be more precise, with small, wooden dens, pervious to the weather,
      and dimly illuminated on the side of the court and the garden by borrowed
      lights styled windows by courtesy, but more like the filthiest
      arrangements for obscuring daylight to be found in little wineshops in the
      suburbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Galleries, parallel passages about twelve feet in height, were formed
      by a triple row of shops. The centre row, giving back and front upon the
      Galleries, was filled with the fetid atmosphere of the place, and derived
      a dubious daylight through the invariably dirty windows of the roof; but
      so thronged were these hives, that rents were excessively high, and as
      much as a thousand crowns was paid for a space scarce six feet by eight.
      The outer rows gave respectively upon the garden and the court, and were
      covered on that side by a slight trellis-work painted green, to protect
      the crazy plastered walls from continual friction with the passers-by. In
      a few square feet of earth at the back of the shops, strange freaks of
      vegetable life unknown to science grew amid the products of various no
      less flourishing industries. You beheld a rosebush capped with printed
      paper in such a sort that the flowers of rhetoric were perfumed by the
      cankered blossoms of that ill-kept, ill-smelling garden. Handbills and
      ribbon streamers of every hue flaunted gaily among the leaves; natural
      flowers competed unsuccessfully for an existence with odds and ends of
      millinery. You discovered a knot of ribbon adorning a green tuft; the
      dahlia admired afar proved on a nearer view to be a satin rosette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palais seen from the court or from the garden was a fantastic sight, a
      grotesque combination of walls of plaster patchwork which had once been
      whitewashed, of blistered paint, heterogeneous placards, and all the most
      unaccountable freaks of Parisian squalor; the green trellises were
      prodigiously the dingier for constant contact with a Parisian public. So,
      upon either side, the fetid, disreputable approaches might have been there
      for the express purpose of warning away fastidious people; but fastidious
      folk no more recoiled before these horrors than the prince in the fairy
      stories turns tail at sight of the dragon or of the other obstacles put
      between him and the princess by the wicked fairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passage through the centre of the Galleries then as now; and,
      as at the present day, you entered them through the two peristyles begun
      before the Revolution, and left unfinished for lack of funds; but in place
      of the handsome modern arcade leading to the Theatre-Francais, you passed
      along a narrow, disproportionately lofty passage, so ill-roofed that the
      rain came through on wet days. All the roofs of the hovels indeed were in
      very bad repair, and covered here and again with a double thickness of
      tarpaulin. A famous silk mercer once brought an action against the Orleans
      family for damages done in the course of a night to his stock of shawls
      and stuffs, and gained the day and a considerable sum. It was in this
      last-named passage, called &ldquo;The Glass Gallery&rdquo; to distinguish it from the
      Wooden Galleries, that Chevet laid the foundations of his fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in the Palais, you trod the natural soil of Paris, augmented by
      importations brought in upon the boots of foot passengers; here, at all
      seasons, you stumbled among hills and hollows of dried mud swept daily by
      the shopman&rsquo;s besom, and only after some practice could you walk at your
      ease. The treacherous mud-heaps, the window-panes incrusted with deposits
      of dust and rain, the mean-looking hovels covered with ragged placards,
      the grimy unfinished walls, the general air of a compromise between a
      gypsy camp, the booths of a country fair, and the temporary structures
      that we in Paris build round about public monuments that remain unbuilt;
      the grotesque aspect of the mart as a whole was in keeping with the
      seething traffic of various kinds carried on within it; for here in this
      shameless, unblushing haunt, amid wild mirth and a babel of talk, an
      immense amount of business was transacted between the Revolution of 1789
      and the Revolution of 1830.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty years the Bourse stood just opposite, on the ground floor of
      the Palais. Public opinion was manufactured, and reputations made and
      ruined here, just as political and financial jobs were arranged. People
      made appointments to meet in the Galleries before or after &lsquo;Change; on
      showery days the Palais Royal was often crowded with weather-bound
      capitalists and men of business. The structure which had grown up, no one
      knew how, about this point was strangely resonant, laughter was
      multiplied; if two men quarreled, the whole place rang from one end to the
      other with the dispute. In the daytime milliners and booksellers enjoyed a
      monopoly of the place; towards nightfall it was filled with women of the
      town. Here dwelt poetry, politics, and prose, new books and classics, the
      glories of ancient and modern literature side by side with political
      intrigue and the tricks of the bookseller&rsquo;s trade. Here all the very
      latest and newest literature were sold to a public which resolutely
      decline to buy elsewhere. Sometimes several thousand copies of such and
      such a pamphlet by Paul-Louis Courier would be sold in a single evening;
      and people crowded thither to buy <i>Les aventures de la fille d&rsquo;un Roi</i>&mdash;that
      first shot fired by the Orleanists at The Charter promulgated by Louis
      XVIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lucien made his first appearance in the Wooden Galleries, some few of
      the shops boasted proper fronts and handsome windows, but these in every
      case looked upon the court or the garden. As for the centre row, until the
      day when the whole strange colony perished under the hammer of Fontaine
      the architect, every shop was open back and front like a booth in a
      country fair, so that from within you could look out upon either side
      through gaps among the goods displayed or through the glass doors. As it
      was obviously impossible to kindle a fire, the tradesmen were fain to use
      charcoal chafing-dishes, and formed a sort of brigade for the prevention
      of fires among themselves; and, indeed, a little carelessness might have
      set the whole quarter blazing in fifteen minutes, for the plank-built
      republic, dried by the heat of the sun, and haunted by too inflammable
      human material, was bedizened with muslin and paper and gauze, and
      ventilated at times by a thorough draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The milliners&rsquo; windows were full of impossible hats and bonnets, displayed
      apparently for advertisement rather than for sale, each on a separate iron
      spit with a knob at the top. The galleries were decked out in all the
      colors of the rainbow. On what heads would those dusty bonnets end their
      careers?&mdash;for a score of years the problem had puzzled frequenters of
      the Palais. Saleswomen, usually plain-featured, but vivacious, waylaid the
      feminine foot passenger with cunning importunities, after the fashion of
      market-women, and using much the same language; a shop-girl, who made free
      use of her eyes and tongue, sat outside on a stool and harangued the
      public with &ldquo;Buy a pretty bonnet, madame?&mdash;Do let me sell you
      something!&rdquo;&mdash;varying a rich and picturesque vocabulary with
      inflections of the voice, with glances, and remarks upon the passers-by.
      Booksellers and milliners lived on terms of mutual understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in the passage known by the pompous title of the &ldquo;Glass
      Gallery&rdquo; that the oddest trades were carried on. Here were ventriloquists
      and charlatans of every sort, and sights of every description, from the
      kind where there is nothing to see to panoramas of the globe. One man who
      has since made seven or eight hundred thousand francs by traveling from
      fair to fair began here by hanging out a signboard, a revolving sun in a
      blackboard, and the inscription in red letters: &ldquo;Here Man may see what God
      can never see. Admittance, two sous.&rdquo; The showman at the door never
      admitted one person alone, nor more than two at a time. Once inside, you
      confronted a great looking-glass; and a voice, which might have terrified
      Hoffmann of Berlin, suddenly spoke as if some spring had been touched,
      &ldquo;You see here, gentlemen, something that God can never see through all
      eternity, that is to say, your like. God has not His like.&rdquo; And out you
      went, too shamefaced to confess to your stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voices issued from every narrow doorway, crying up the merits of
      Cosmoramas, views of Constantinople, marionettes, automatic chess-players,
      and performing dogs who would pick you out the prettiest woman in the
      company. The ventriloquist Fritz-James flourished here in the Cafe Borel
      before he went to fight and fall at Montmartre with the young lads from
      the Ecole polytechnique. Here, too, there were fruit and flower shops, and
      a famous tailor whose gold-laced uniforms shone like the sun when the
      shops were lighted at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a morning the galleries were empty, dark, and deserted; the shopkeepers
      chatted among themselves. Towards two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the Palais
      began to fill; at three, men came in from the Bourse, and Paris, generally
      speaking, crowded the place. Impecunious youth, hungering after
      literature, took the opportunity of turning over the pages of the books
      exposed for sale on the stalls outside the booksellers&rsquo; shops; the men in
      charge charitably allowed a poor student to pursue his course of free
      studies; and in this way a duodecimo volume of some two hundred pages,
      such as <i>Smarra</i> or <i>Pierre Schlemihl</i>, or <i>Jean Sbogar</i> or
      <i>Jocko</i>, might be devoured in a couple of afternoons. There was
      something very French in this alms given to the young, hungry, starved
      intellect. Circulating libraries were not as yet; if you wished to read a
      book, you were obliged to buy it, for which reason novels of the early
      part of the century were sold in numbers which now seem well-nigh fabulous
      to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poetry of this terrible mart appeared in all its splendor at the
      close of the day. Women of the town, flocking in and out from the
      neighboring streets, were allowed to make a promenade of the Wooden
      Galleries. Thither came prostitutes from every quarter of Paris to &ldquo;do the
      Palais.&rdquo; The Stone Galleries belonged to privileged houses, which paid for
      the right of exposing women dressed like princesses under such and such an
      arch, or in the corresponding space of garden; but the Wooden Galleries
      were the common ground of women of the streets. This was <i>the</i>
      Palais, a word which used to signify the temple of prostitution. A woman
      might come and go, taking away her prey whithersoever seemed good to her.
      So great was the crowd attracted thither at night by the women, that it
      was impossible to move except at a slow pace, as in a procession or at a
      masked ball. Nobody objected to the slowness; it facilitated examination.
      The women dressed in a way that is never seen nowadays. The bodices cut
      extremely low both back and front; the fantastical head-dresses, designed
      to attract notice; here a cap from the Pays de Caux, and there a Spanish
      mantilla; the hair crimped and curled like a poodle&rsquo;s, or smoothed down in
      bandeaux over the forehead; the close-fitting white stockings and limbs,
      revealed it would not be easy to say how, but always at the right moment&mdash;all
      this poetry of vice has fled. The license of question and reply, the
      public cynicism in keeping with the haunt, is now unknown even at
      masquerades or the famous public balls. It was an appalling, gay scene.
      The dazzling white flesh of the women&rsquo;s necks and shoulders stood out in
      magnificent contrast against the men&rsquo;s almost invariably sombre costumes.
      The murmur of voices, the hum of the crowd, could be heard even in the
      middle of the garden as a sort of droning bass, interspersed with <i>fioriture</i>
      of shrill laughter or clamor of some rare dispute. You saw gentlemen and
      celebrities cheek by jowl with gallows-birds. There was something
      indescribably piquant about the anomalous assemblage; the most insensible
      of men felt its charm, so much so, that, until the very last moment, Paris
      came hither to walk up and down on the wooden planks laid over the cellars
      where men were at work on the new buildings; and when the squalid wooden
      erections were finally taken down, great and unanimous regret was felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladvocat the bookseller had opened a shop but a few days since in the
      angle formed by the central passage which crossed the galleries; and
      immediately opposite another bookseller, now forgotten, Dauriat, a bold
      and youthful pioneer, who opened up the paths in which his rival was to
      shine. Dauriat&rsquo;s shop stood in the row which gave upon the garden;
      Ladvocat&rsquo;s, on the opposite side, looked out upon the court. Dauriat&rsquo;s
      establishment was divided into two parts; his shop was simply a great
      trade warehouse, and the second room was his private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, on this first visit to the Wooden Galleries, was bewildered by a
      sight which no novice can resist. He soon lost the guide who befriended
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were as good-looking as yonder young fellow, I would give you your
      money&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; a woman said, pointing out Lucien to an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien slunk through the crowd like a blind man&rsquo;s dog, following the
      stream in a state of stupefaction and excitement difficult to describe.
      Importuned by glances and white-rounded contours, dazzled by the audacious
      display of bared throat and bosom, he gripped his roll of manuscript
      tightly lest somebody should steal it&mdash;innocent that he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed, thinking, when some one caught him
      by the arm, that his poetry had proved too great a temptation to some
      author&rsquo;s honesty, and turning, he recognized Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure that you would find your way here at last,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet was standing in the doorway of a shop crowded with persons
      waiting for an audience with the sultan of the publishing trade. Printers,
      paper-dealers, and designers were catechizing Dauriat&rsquo;s assistants as to
      present or future business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau drew Lucien into the shop. &ldquo;There! that is Finot who edits my
      paper,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he is talking with Felicien Vernou, who has abilities,
      but the little wretch is as dangerous as a hidden disease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old boy, there is a first night for you,&rdquo; said Finot, coming up
      with Vernou. &ldquo;I have disposed of the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold it to Braulard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and if I did, what then? You will get a seat. What do you want with
      Dauriat? Oh, it is agreed that we are to push Paul de Kock, Dauriat has
      taken two hundred copies, and Victor Ducange is refusing to give him his
      next. Dauriat wants to set up another man in the same line, he says. You
      must rate Paul de Kock above Ducange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have a piece on with Ducange at the Gaite,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, tell him that I wrote the article. It can be supposed that I
      wrote a slashing review, and you toned it down; and he will owe you
      thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get Dauriat&rsquo;s cashier to discount this bit of a bill for a
      hundred francs?&rdquo; asked Etienne Lousteau. &ldquo;We are celebrating Florine&rsquo;s
      house-warming with a supper to-night, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, you are treating us all,&rdquo; said Finot, with an apparent effort of
      memory. &ldquo;Here, Gabusson,&rdquo; he added, handing Barbet&rsquo;s bill to the cashier,
      &ldquo;let me have ninety francs for this individual.&mdash;Fill in your name,
      old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau signed his name while the cashier counted out the money; and
      Lucien, all eyes and ears, lost not a syllable of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not all, my friend,&rdquo; Etienne continued; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t thank you, we
      have sworn an eternal friendship. I have taken it upon myself to introduce
      this gentleman to Dauriat, and you must incline his ear to listen to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is on foot?&rdquo; asked Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A volume of poetry,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Finot, with a shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your acquaintance cannot have had much to do with publishers, or he would
      have hidden his manuscript in the loneliest spot in his dwelling,&rdquo;
       remarked Vernou, looking at Lucien as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment a good-looking young man came into the shop, gave a
      hand to Finot and Lousteau, and nodded slightly to Vernou. The newcomer
      was Emile Blondet, who had made his first appearance in the <i>Journal des
      Debats</i>, with articles revealing capacities of the very highest order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and have supper with us at midnight, at Florine&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the newcomer. &ldquo;But who is going to be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Florine and Matifat the druggist,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;and du Bruel, the
      author who gave Florine the part in which she is to make her first
      appearance, a little old fogy named Cardot, and his son-in-law Camusot,
      and Finot, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your druggist do things properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not give us doctored wine,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very witty, monsieur,&rdquo; Blondet returned gravely. &ldquo;Is he coming,
      Lousteau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall have some fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had flushed red to the tips of his ears. Blondet tapped on the
      window above Dauriat&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your business likely to keep you long, Dauriat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Lousteau, addressing his protege. &ldquo;That young fellow
      is hardly any older than you are, and he is on the <i>Debats</i>! He is
      one of the princes of criticism. They are afraid of him, Dauriat will fawn
      upon him, and then we can put in a word about our business with the pasha
      of vignettes and type. Otherwise we might have waited till eleven o&rsquo;clock,
      and our turn would not have come. The crowd of people waiting to speak
      with Dauriat is growing bigger every moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien and Lousteau followed Blondet, Finot, and Vernou, and stood in a
      knot at the back of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; asked Blondet of the head-clerk, who rose to bid him
      good-evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is buying a weekly newspaper. He wants to put new life into it, and
      set up a rival to the <i>Minerve</i> and the <i>Conservateur</i>; Eymery
      has rather too much of his own way in the <i>Minerve</i>, and the <i>Conservateur</i>
      is too blindly Romantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he going to pay well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only too much&mdash;as usual,&rdquo; said the cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he spoke another young man entered; this was the writer of a
      magnificent novel which had sold very rapidly and met with the greatest
      possible success. Dauriat was bringing out a second edition. The
      appearance of this odd and extraordinary looking being, so unmistakably an
      artist, made a deep impression on Lucien&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Nathan,&rdquo; Lousteau said in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan, then in the prime of his youth, came up to the group of
      journalists, hat in hand; and in spite of his look of fierce pride he was
      almost humble to Blondet, whom as yet he only knew by sight. Blondet did
      not remove his hat, neither did Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I am delighted to avail myself of an opportunity yielded by
      chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;He is so nervous that he is committing a pleonasm,&rdquo; said Felicien in an
      aside to Lousteau.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;to give expression to my gratitude for the splendid review
      which you were so good as to give me in the <i>Journal des Debats</i>.
      Half the success of my book is owing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear fellow, no,&rdquo; said Blondet, with an air of patronage scarcely
      masked by good-nature. &ldquo;You have talent, the deuce you have, and I&rsquo;m
      delighted to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that your review has appeared, I shall not seem to be courting power;
      we can feel at ease. Will you do me the honor and the pleasure of dining
      with me to-morrow? Finot is coming.&mdash;Lousteau, old man, you will not
      refuse me, will you?&rdquo; added Nathan, shaking Etienne by the hand.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,
      you are on the way to a great future, monsieur,&rdquo; he added, turning again
      to Blondet; &ldquo;you will carry on the line of Dussaults, Fievees, and
      Geoffrois! Hoffmann was talking about you to a friend of mine, Claude
      Vignon, his pupil; he said that he could die in peace, the <i>Journal des
      Debats</i> would live forever. They ought to pay you tremendously well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred francs a column,&rdquo; said Blondet. &ldquo;Poor pay when one is obliged
      to read the books, and read a hundred before you find one worth
      interesting yourself in, like yours. Your work gave me pleasure, upon my
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And brought him in fifteen hundred francs,&rdquo; said Lousteau for Lucien&rsquo;s
      benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you write political articles, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; now and again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien felt like an embryo among these men; he had admired Nathan&rsquo;s book,
      he had reverenced the author as an immortal; Nathan&rsquo;s abject attitude
      before this critic, whose name and importance were both unknown to him,
      stupefied Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How if I should come to behave as he does?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Is a man obliged
      to part with his self-respect?&mdash;Pray put on your hat again, Nathan;
      you have written a great book, and the critic has only written a review of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts set the blood tingling in his veins. Scarce a minute passed
      but some young author, poverty-stricken and shy, came in, asked to speak
      with Dauriat, looked round the crowded shop despairingly, and went out
      saying, &ldquo;I will come back again.&rdquo; Two or three politicians were chatting
      over the convocation of the Chambers and public business with a group of
      well-known public men. The weekly newspaper for which Dauriat was in
      treaty was licensed to treat of matters political, and the number of
      newspapers suffered to exist was growing smaller and smaller, till a paper
      was a piece of property as much in demand as a theatre. One of the largest
      shareholders in the <i>Constitutionnel</i> was standing in the midst of
      the knot of political celebrities. Lousteau performed the part of cicerone
      to admiration; with every sentence he uttered Dauriat rose higher in
      Lucien&rsquo;s opinion. Politics and literature seemed to converge in Dauriat&rsquo;s
      shop. He had seen a great poet prostituting his muse to journalism,
      humiliating Art, as woman was humiliated and prostituted in those
      shameless galleries without, and the provincial took a terrible lesson to
      heart. Money! That was the key to every enigma. Lucien realized the fact
      that he was unknown and alone, and that the fragile clue of an uncertain
      friendship was his sole guide to success and fortune. He blamed the kind
      and loyal little circle for painting the world for him in false colors,
      for preventing him from plunging into the arena, pen in hand. &ldquo;I should be
      a Blondet at this moment!&rdquo; he exclaimed within himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a little while ago they had sat looking out over Paris from the
      Gardens of the Luxembourg, and Lousteau had uttered the cry of a wounded
      eagle; then Lousteau had been a great man in Lucien&rsquo;s eyes, and now he had
      shrunk to scarce visible proportions. The really important man for him at
      this moment was the fashionable bookseller, by whom all these men lived;
      and the poet, manuscript in hand, felt a nervous tremor that was almost
      like fear. He noticed a group of busts mounted on wooden pedestals,
      painted to resemble marble; Byron stood there, and Goethe and M. de
      Canalis. Dauriat was hoping to publish a volume by the last-named poet,
      who might see, on his entrance into the shop, the estimation in which he
      was held by the trade. Unconsciously Lucien&rsquo;s own self-esteem began to
      shrink, and his courage ebbed. He began to see how large a part this
      Dauriat would play in his destinies, and waited impatiently for him to
      appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, children,&rdquo; said a voice, and a short, stout man appeared, with a
      puffy face that suggested a Roman pro-consul&rsquo;s visage, mellowed by an air
      of good-nature which deceived superficial observers. &ldquo;Well, children, here
      am I, the proprietor of the only weekly paper in the market, a paper with
      two thousand subscribers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old joker! The registered number is seven hundred, and that is over the
      mark,&rdquo; said Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve thousand, on my sacred word of honor&mdash;I said two thousand for
      the benefit of the printers and paper-dealers yonder,&rdquo; he added, lowering
      his voice, then raising it again. &ldquo;I thought you had more tact, my boy,&rdquo;
       he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to take any partners?&rdquo; inquired Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Dauriat. &ldquo;Will you take a third at forty thousand
      francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain, if you will take Emile Blondet here on the staff, and
      Claude Vignon, Scribe, Theodore Leclercq, Felicien Vernou, Jay, Jouy,
      Lousteau, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not Lucien de Rubempre?&rdquo; the provincial poet put in boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and Nathan,&rdquo; concluded Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not the people out there in the street?&rdquo; asked Dauriat, scowling at
      the author of the <i>Marguerites</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;To whom have I the honor of
      speaking?&rdquo; he added, with an insolent glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Dauriat,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;I have brought this gentleman to
      you. Listen to me, while Finot is thinking over your proposals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien watched this Dauriat, who addressed Finot with the familiar tu,
      which even Finot did not permit himself to use in reply; who called the
      redoubtable Blondet &ldquo;my boy,&rdquo; and extended a hand royally to Nathan with a
      friendly nod. The provincial poet felt his shirt wet with perspiration
      when the formidable sultan looked indifferent and ill pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another piece of business, my boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Dauriat. &ldquo;Why, I have
      eleven hundred manuscripts on hand, as you know! Yes, gentlemen, I have
      eleven hundred manuscripts submitted to me at this moment; ask Gabusson. I
      shall soon be obliged to start a department to keep account of the stock
      of manuscripts, and a special office for reading them, and a committee to
      vote on their merits, with numbered counters for those who attend, and a
      permanent secretary to draw up the minutes for me. It will be a kind of
      local branch of the Academie, and the Academicians will be better paid in
      the Wooden Galleries than at the Institut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an idea,&rdquo; said Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad idea,&rdquo; returned Dauriat. &ldquo;It is not my business to take stock of
      the lucubrations of those among you who take to literature because they
      cannot be capitalists, and there is no opening for them as bootmakers, nor
      corporals, nor domestic servants, nor officials, nor bailiffs. Nobody
      comes here until he has made a name for himself! Make a name for yourself,
      and you will find gold in torrents. I have made three great men in the
      last two years; and lo and behold three examples of ingratitude! Here is
      Nathan talking of six thousand francs for the second edition of his book,
      which cost me three thousand francs in reviews, and has not brought in a
      thousand yet. I paid a thousand francs for Blondet&rsquo;s two articles, besides
      a dinner, which cost me five hundred&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if all booksellers talked as you do, sir, how could a man publish his
      first book at all?&rdquo; asked Lucien. Blondet had gone down tremendously in
      his opinion since he had heard the amount given by Dauriat for the
      articles in the <i>Debats</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not my affair,&rdquo; said Dauriat, looking daggers at this handsome
      young fellow, who was smiling pleasantly at him. &ldquo;I do not publish books
      for amusement, nor risk two thousand francs for the sake of seeing my
      money back again. I speculate in literature, and publish forty volumes of
      ten thousand copies each, just as Panckouke does and the Baudoins. With my
      influence and the articles which I secure, I can push a business of a
      hundred thousand crowns, instead of a single volume involving a couple of
      thousand francs. It is just as much trouble to bring out a new name and to
      induce the public to take up an author and his book, as to make a success
      with the <i>Theatres etrangers</i>, <i>Victoires et Conquetes</i>, or <i>Memoires
      sur la Revolution</i>, books that bring in a fortune. I am not here as a
      stepping-stone to future fame, but to make money, and to find it for men
      with distinguished names. The manuscripts for which I give a hundred
      thousand francs pay me better than work by an unknown author who asks six
      hundred. If I am not exactly a Maecenas, I deserve the gratitude of
      literature; I have doubled the prices of manuscripts. I am giving you this
      explanation because you are a friend of Lousteau&rsquo;s my boy,&rdquo; added Dauriat,
      clapping Lucien on the shoulder with odious familiarity. &ldquo;If I were to
      talk to all the authors who have a mind that I should be their publisher,
      I should have to shut up shop; I should pass my time very agreeably no
      doubt, but the conversations would cost too much. I am not rich enough yet
      to listen to all the monologues of self-conceit. Nobody does, except in
      classical tragedies on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The terrible Dauriat&rsquo;s gorgeous raiment seemed in the provincial poet&rsquo;s
      eyes to add force to the man&rsquo;s remorseless logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it about?&rdquo; he continued, addressing Lucien&rsquo;s protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a volume of magnificent poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that word, Dauriat turned to Gabusson with a gesture worthy of Talma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabusson, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from this day forward, when anybody
      begins to talk of works in manuscript here&mdash;Do you hear that, all of
      you?&rdquo; he broke in upon himself; and three assistants at once emerged from
      among the piles of books at the sound of their employer&rsquo;s wrathful voice.
      &ldquo;If anybody comes here with manuscripts,&rdquo; he continued, looking at the
      finger-nails of a well-kept hand, &ldquo;ask him whether it is poetry or prose;
      and if he says poetry, show him the door at once. Verses mean reverses in
      the booktrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! well put, Dauriat,&rdquo; cried the chorus of journalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; cried the bookseller, striding about his shop with Lucien&rsquo;s
      manuscript in his hand. &ldquo;You have no idea, gentlemen, of the amount of
      harm that Byron, Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Casimir Delavigne, Canalis, and
      Beranger have done by their success. The fame of them has brought down an
      invasion of barbarians upon us. I know <i>this</i>: there are a thousand
      volumes of manuscript poetry going the round of the publishers at this
      moment, things that nobody can make head nor tail of, stories in verse
      that begin in the middle, like <i>The Corsair</i> and <i>Lara</i>. They
      set up to be original, forsooth, and indulge in stanzas that nobody can
      understand, and descriptive poetry after the pattern of the younger men
      who discovered Delille, and imagine that they are doing something new.
      Poets have been swarming like cockchafers for two years past. I have lost
      twenty thousand francs through poetry in the last twelvemonth. You ask
      Gabusson! There may be immortal poets somewhere in the world; I know of
      some that are blooming and rosy, and have no beards on their chins as
      yet,&rdquo; he continued, looking at Lucien; &ldquo;but in the trade, young man, there
      are only four poets&mdash;Beranger, Casimir Delavigne, Lamartine, and
      Victor Hugo; as for Canalis&mdash;he is a poet made by sheer force of
      writing him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien felt that he lacked the courage to hold up his head and show his
      spirit before all these influential persons, who were laughing with all
      their might. He knew very well that he should look hopelessly ridiculous,
      and yet he felt consumed by a fierce desire to catch the bookseller by the
      throat, to ruffle the insolent composure of his cravat, to break the gold
      chain that glittered on the man&rsquo;s chest, trample his watch under his feet,
      and tear him in pieces. Mortified vanity opened the door to thoughts of
      vengeance, and inwardly he swore eternal enmity to that bookseller. But he
      smiled amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poetry is like the sun,&rdquo; said Blondet, &ldquo;giving life alike to primeval
      forests and to ants and gnats and mosquitoes. There is no virtue but has a
      vice to match, and literature breeds the publisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the journalist,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this after all?&rdquo; he asked, holding up the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A volume of sonnets that will put Petrarch to the blush,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; answered Lousteau, seeing the knowing smile that went
      round the group. Lucien could not take offence but he chafed inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will read them,&rdquo; said Dauriat, with a regal gesture that
      marked the full extent of the concession. &ldquo;If these sonnets of yours are
      up to the level of the nineteenth century, I will make a great poet of
      you, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has brains to equal his good looks, you will run no great risks,&rdquo;
       remarked one of the greatest public speakers of the day, a deputy who was
      chatting with the editor of the <i>Minerve</i>, and a writer for the <i>Constitutionnel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fame means twelve thousand francs in reviews, and a thousand more for
      dinners, General,&rdquo; said Dauriat. &ldquo;If M. Benjamin de Constant means to
      write a paper on this young poet, it will not be long before I make a
      bargain with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the title of General, and the distinguished name of Benjamin Constant,
      the bookseller&rsquo;s shop took the proportions of Olympus for the provincial
      great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lousteau, I want a word with you,&rdquo; said Finot; &ldquo;but I shall see you again
      later, at the theatre.&mdash;Dauriat, I will take your offer, but on
      conditions. Let us step into your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, my boy,&rdquo; answered Dauriat, allowing Finot to pass before him.
      Then, intimating to some ten persons still waiting for him that he was
      engaged, he likewise was about to disappear when Lucien impatiently
      stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are keeping my manuscript. When shall I have an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come back in three or four days, my little poet, and we will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau hurried Lucien away; he had not time to take leave of Vernou and
      Blondet and Raoul Nathan, nor to salute General Foy nor Benjamin Constant,
      whose book on the Hundred Days was just about to appear. Lucien scarcely
      caught a glimpse of fair hair, a refined oval-shaped face, keen eyes, and
      the pleasant-looking mouth belonging to the man who had played the part of
      a Potemkin to Mme. de Stael for twenty years, and now was at war with the
      Bourbons, as he had been at war with Napoleon. He was destined to win his
      cause and to die stricken to earth by his victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shop!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien, as he took his place in the cab beside
      Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Panorama-Dramatique; look sharp, and you shall have thirty sous,&rdquo;
       Etienne Lousteau called to the cabman.&mdash;&ldquo;Dauriat is a rascal who
      sells books to the amount of fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand francs
      every year. He is a kind of Minister of Literature,&rdquo; Lousteau continued.
      His self-conceit had been pleasantly tickled, and he was showing off
      before Lucien. &ldquo;Dauriat is just as grasping as Barbet, but it is on a
      wholesale scale. Dauriat can be civil, and he is generous, but he has a
      great opinion of himself; as for his wit, it consists in a faculty for
      picking up all that he hears, and his shop is a capital place to frequent.
      You meet all the best men at Dauriat&rsquo;s. A young fellow learns more there
      in an hour than by poring over books for half-a-score of years. People
      talk about articles and concoct subjects; you make the acquaintance of
      great or influential people who may be useful to you. You must know people
      if you mean to get on nowadays.&mdash;It is all luck, you see. And as for
      sitting by yourself in a corner alone with your intellect, it is the most
      dangerous thing of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what insolence!&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! we all of us laugh at Dauriat,&rdquo; said Etienne. &ldquo;If you are in need
      of him, he tramples upon you; if he has need of the <i>Journal des Debats</i>,
      Emile Blondet sets him spinning like a top. Oh, if you take to literature,
      you will see a good many queer things. Well, what was I telling you, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were right,&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;My experience in that shop was even
      more painful than I expected, after your programme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you choose to suffer? You find your subject, you wear out your
      wits over it with toiling at night, you throw your very life into it: and
      after all your journeyings in the fields of thought, the monument reared
      with your life-blood is simply a good or a bad speculation for a
      publisher. Your work will sell or it will not sell; and therein, for them,
      lies the whole question. A book means so much capital to risk, and the
      better the book, the less likely it is to sell. A man of talent rises
      above the level of ordinary heads; his success varies in direct ratio with
      the time required for his work to be appreciated. And no publisher wants
      to wait. To-day&rsquo;s book must be sold by to-morrow. Acting on this system,
      publishers and booksellers do not care to take real literature, books that
      call for the high praise that comes slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Arthez was right,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know d&rsquo;Arthez?&rdquo; asked Lousteau. &ldquo;I know of no more dangerous
      company than solitary spirits like that fellow yonder, who fancy that they
      can draw the world after them. All of us begin by thinking that we are
      capable of great things; and when once a youthful imagination is heated by
      this superstition, the candidate for posthumous honors makes no attempt to
      move the world while such moving of the world is both possible and
      profitable; he lets the time go by. I am for Mahomet&rsquo;s system&mdash;if the
      mountain does not come to me, I am for going to the mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The common-sense so trenchantly put in this sally left Lucien halting
      between the resignation preached by the brotherhood and Lousteau&rsquo;s
      militant doctrine. He said not a word till they reached the Boulevard du
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Panorama-Dramatique no longer exists. A dwelling-house stands on the
      site of the once charming theatre in the Boulevard du Temple, where two
      successive managements collapsed without making a single hit; and yet
      Vignol, who has since fallen heir to some of Potier&rsquo;s popularity, made his
      <i>debut</i> there; and Florine, five years later a celebrated actress,
      made her first appearance in the theatre opposite the Rue Charlot.
      Play-houses, like men, have their vicissitudes. The Panorama-Dramatique
      suffered from competition. The machinations of its rivals, the Ambigu, the
      Gaite, the Porte Saint-Martin, and the Vaudeville, together with a
      plethora of restrictions and a scarcity of good plays, combined to bring
      about the downfall of the house. No dramatic author cared to quarrel with
      a prosperous theatre for the sake of the Panorama-Dramatique, whose
      existence was, to say the least, problematical. The management at this
      moment, however, was counting on the success of a new melodramatic comedy
      by M. du Bruel, a young author who, after working in collaboration with
      divers celebrities, had now produced a piece professedly entirely his own.
      It had been specially composed for the leading lady, a young actress who
      began her stage career as a supernumerary at the Gaite, and had been
      promoted to small parts for the last twelvemonth. But though Mlle.
      Florine&rsquo;s acting had attracted some attention, she obtained no engagement,
      and the Panorama accordingly had carried her off. Coralie, another
      actress, was to make her <i>debut</i> at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was amazed at the power wielded by the press. &ldquo;This gentleman is
      with me,&rdquo; said Etienne Lousteau, and the box-office clerks bowed before
      him as one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find it no easy matter to get seats,&rdquo; said the head-clerk.
      &ldquo;There is nothing left now but the stage box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain amount of time was wasted in controversies with the box-keepers
      in the lobbies, when Etienne said, &ldquo;Let us go behind the scenes; we will
      speak to the manager, he will take us into the stage-box; and besides, I
      will introduce you to Florine, the heroine of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Etienne Lousteau, the doorkeeper of the orchestra took out
      a little key and unlocked a door in the thickness of the wall. Lucien,
      following his friend, went suddenly out of the lighted corridor into the
      black darkness of the passage between the house and the wings. A short
      flight of damp steps surmounted, one of the strangest of all spectacles
      opened out before the provincial poet&rsquo;s eyes. The height of the roof, the
      slenderness of the props, the ladders hung with Argand lamps, the
      atrocious ugliness of scenery beheld at close quarters, the thick paint on
      the actors&rsquo; faces, and their outlandish costumes, made of such coarse
      materials, the stage carpenters in greasy jackets, the firemen, the stage
      manager strutting about with his hat on his head, the supernumeraries
      sitting among the hanging back-scenes, the ropes and pulleys, the
      heterogeneous collection of absurdities, shabby, dirty, hideous, and
      gaudy, was something so altogether different from the stage seen over the
      footlights, that Lucien&rsquo;s astonishment knew no bounds. The curtain was
      just about to fall on a good old-fashioned melodrama entitled <i>Bertram</i>,
      a play adapted from a tragedy by Maturin which Charles Nodier, together
      with Byron and Sir Walter Scott, held in the highest esteem, though the
      play was a failure on the stage in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep a tight hold of my arm, unless you have a mind to fall through a
      trap-door, or bring down a forest on your head; you will pull down a
      palace, or carry off a cottage, if you are not careful,&rdquo; said Etienne.&mdash;&ldquo;Is
      Florine in her dressing-room, my pet?&rdquo; he added, addressing an actress who
      stood waiting for her cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, love. Thank you for the things you said about me. You are so much
      nicer since Florine has come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t spoil your entry, little one. Quick with you, look sharp, and
      say, &lsquo;Stop, wretched man!&rsquo; nicely, for there are two thousand francs of
      takings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was struck with amazement when the girl&rsquo;s whole face suddenly
      changed, and she shrieked, &ldquo;Stop, wretched man!&rdquo; a cry that froze the
      blood in your veins. She was no longer the same creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the stage,&rdquo; he said to Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like the bookseller&rsquo;s shop in the Wooden Galleries, or a literary
      paper,&rdquo; said Etienne Lousteau; &ldquo;it is a kitchen, neither more nor less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nathan appeared at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; inquired Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am doing the minor theatres for the <i>Gazette</i> until something
      better turns up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! come to supper with us this evening; speak well of Florine, and I
      will do as much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much at your service,&rdquo; returned Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know; she is living in the Rue du Bondy now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lousteau, dear boy, who is the handsome young man that you have brought
      with you?&rdquo; asked the actress, now returned to the wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great poet, dear, that will have a famous name one of these days.&mdash;M.
      Nathan, I must introduce M. Lucien de Rubempre to you, as you are to meet
      again at supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good name, monsieur,&rdquo; said Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucien, M. Raoul Nathan,&rdquo; continued Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read your book two days ago; and, upon my word, I cannot understand how
      you, who have written such a book, and such poetry, can be so humble to a
      journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till your first book comes out,&rdquo; said Nathan, and a shrewd smile
      flitted over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! I say! here are Ultras and Liberals actually shaking hands!&rdquo; cried
      Vernou, spying the trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning I hold the views of my paper,&rdquo; said Nathan, &ldquo;in the
      evening I think as I please; all journalists see double at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felicien Vernou turned to Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finot is looking for you, Etienne; he came with me, and&mdash;here he
      is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by the by, there is not a place in the house, is there?&rdquo; asked Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will always find a place in our hearts,&rdquo; said the actress, with the
      sweetest smile imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, my little Florville, are you cured already of your fancy? They
      told me that a Russian prince had carried you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who carries off women in these days&rdquo; said Florville (she who had cried,
      &ldquo;Stop, wretched man!&rdquo;). &ldquo;We stayed at Saint-Mande for ten days, and my
      prince got off with paying the forfeit money to the management. The
      manager will go down on his knees to pray for some more Russian princes,&rdquo;
       Florville continued, laughing; &ldquo;the forfeit money was so much clear gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for you, child,&rdquo; said Finot, turning to a pretty girl in a
      peasant&rsquo;s costume, &ldquo;where did you steal these diamond ear-drops? Have you
      hooked an Indian prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a blacking manufacturer, an Englishman, who has gone off already. It
      is not everybody who can find millionaire shopkeepers, tired of domestic
      life, whenever they like, as Florine does and Coralie. Aren&rsquo;t they just
      lucky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florville, you will make a bad entry,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;the blacking has
      gone to your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want a success,&rdquo; said Nathan, &ldquo;instead of screaming, &lsquo;He is
      saved!&rsquo; like a Fury, walk on quite quietly, go to the staircase, and say,
      &lsquo;He is saved,&rsquo; in a chest voice, like Pasta&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>O patria</i>,&rsquo; in <i>Tancreda</i>.&mdash;There,
      go along!&rdquo; and he pushed her towards the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; said Vernou, &ldquo;the effect has hung fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she do? the house is applauding like mad,&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went down on her knees and showed her bosom; that is her great resource,&rdquo;
       said the blacking-maker&rsquo;s widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manager is giving up the stage box to us; you will find me there when
      you come,&rdquo; said Finot, as Lousteau walked off with Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the stage, through a labyrinth of scenery and corridors,
      the pair climbed several flights of stairs and reached a little room on a
      third floor, Nathan and Felicien Vernou following them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day or good-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Florine. Then, turning to a
      short, stout man standing in a corner, &ldquo;These gentlemen are the rulers of
      my destiny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my future is in their hands; but they will be
      under our table to-morrow morning, I hope, if M. Lousteau has forgotten
      nothing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten! You are going to have Blondet of the <i>Debats</i>,&rdquo; said
      Etienne, &ldquo;the genuine Blondet, the very Blondet&mdash;Blondet himself, in
      short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Lousteau, you dear boy! stop, I must give you a kiss,&rdquo; and she flung
      her arms about the journalist&rsquo;s neck. Matifat, the stout person in the
      corner, looked serious at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine was thin; her beauty, like a bud, gave promise of the flower to
      come; the girl of sixteen could only delight the eyes of artists who
      prefer the sketch to the picture. All the quick subtlety of her character
      was visible in the features of the charming actress, who at that time
      might have sat for Goethe&rsquo;s Mignon. Matifat, a wealthy druggist of the Rue
      des Lombards, had imagined that a little Boulevard actress would have no
      very expensive tastes, but in eleven months Florine had cost him sixty
      thousand francs. Nothing seemed more extraordinary to Lucien than the
      sight of an honest and worthy merchant standing like a statue of the god
      Terminus in the actress&rsquo; narrow dressing-room, a tiny place some ten feet
      square, hung with a pretty wall-paper, and adorned with a full-length
      mirror, a sofa, and two chairs. There was a fireplace in the
      dressing-closet, a carpet on the floor, and cupboards all round the room.
      A dresser was putting the finishing touches to a Spanish costume; for
      Florine was to take the part of a countess in an imbroglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl will be the handsomest actress in Paris in five years&rsquo; time,&rdquo;
       said Nathan, turning to Felicien Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, darlings, you will take care of me to-morrow, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
      Florine, turning to the three journalists. &ldquo;I have engaged cabs for
      to-night, for I am going to send you home as tipsy as Shrove Tuesday.
      Matifat has sent in wines&mdash;oh! wines worthy of Louis XVIII., and
      engaged the Prussian ambassador&rsquo;s cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We expect something enormous from the look of the gentleman,&rdquo; remarked
      Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is quite aware that he is treating the most dangerous men in
      Paris,&rdquo; added Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matifat was looking uneasily at Lucien; he felt jealous of the young man&rsquo;s
      good looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here is some one that I do not know,&rdquo; Florine continued, confronting
      Lucien. &ldquo;Which of you has imported the Apollo Belvedere from Florence? He
      is as charming as one of Girodet&rsquo;s figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a poet, mademoiselle, from the provinces. I forgot to present him
      to you; you are so beautiful to-night that you put the <i>Complete Guide
      to Etiquette</i> out of a man&rsquo;s head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so rich that he can afford to write poetry?&rdquo; asked Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor as Job,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great temptation for some of us,&rdquo; said the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the author of the play suddenly entered, and Lucien beheld M. du
      Bruel, a short, attenuated young man in an overcoat, a composite human
      blend of the jack-in-office, the owner of house-property, and the
      stockbroker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine, child,&rdquo; said this personage, &ldquo;are you sure of your part, eh? No
      slips of memory, you know. And mind that scene in the second act, make the
      irony tell, bring out that subtle touch; say, &lsquo;I do not love you,&rsquo; just as
      we agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you take parts in which you have to say such things?&rdquo; asked
      Matifat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The druggist&rsquo;s remark was received with a general shout of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter to you,&rdquo; said Florine, &ldquo;so long as I don&rsquo;t say such
      things to you, great stupid?&mdash;Oh! his stupidity is the pleasure of my
      life,&rdquo; she continued, glancing at the journalist. &ldquo;Upon my word, I would
      pay him so much for every blunder, if it would not be the ruin of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you will look at me when you say it, as you do when you are
      rehearsing, and it gives me a turn,&rdquo; remonstrated the druggist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, I will look at my friend Lousteau here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bell rang outside in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out, all of you!&rdquo; cried Florine; &ldquo;let me read my part over again and
      try to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien and Lousteau were the last to go. Lousteau set a kiss on Florine&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and Lucien heard her say, &ldquo;Not to-night. Impossible. That stupid
      old animal told his wife that he was going out into the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she charming?&rdquo; said Etienne, as they came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but that Matifat, my dear fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you know nothing of Parisian life, my boy. Some things cannot be
      helped. Suppose that you fell in love with a married woman, it comes to
      the same thing. It all depends on the way that you look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne and Lucien entered the stage-box, and found the manager there with
      Finot. Matifat was in the ground-floor box exactly opposite with a friend
      of his, a silk-mercer named Camusot (Coralie&rsquo;s protector), and a worthy
      little old soul, his father-in-law. All three of these city men were
      polishing their opera-glasses, and anxiously scanning the house; certain
      symptoms in the pit appeared to disturb them. The usual heterogeneous
      first-night elements filled the boxes&mdash;journalists and their
      mistresses, <i>lorettes</i> and their lovers, a sprinkling of the
      determined playgoers who never miss a first night if they can help it, and
      a very few people of fashion who care for this sort of sensation. The
      first box was occupied by the head of a department, to whom du Bruel,
      maker of vaudevilles, owed a snug little sinecure in the Treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had gone from surprise to surprise since the dinner at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s. For two months Literature had meant a life of poverty and
      want; in Lousteau&rsquo;s room he had seen it at its cynical worst; in the
      Wooden Galleries he had met Literature abject and Literature insolent. The
      sharp contrasts of heights and depths; of compromise with conscience; of
      supreme power and want of principle; of treachery and pleasure; of mental
      elevation and bondage&mdash;all this made his head swim, he seemed to be
      watching some strange unheard-of drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finot was talking with the manager. &ldquo;Do you think du Bruel&rsquo;s piece will
      pay?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Du Bruel has tried to do something in Beaumarchais&rsquo; style. Boulevard
      audiences don&rsquo;t care for that kind of thing; they like harrowing
      sensations; wit is not much appreciated here. Everything depends on
      Florine and Coralie to-night; they are bewitchingly pretty and graceful,
      wear very short skirts, and dance a Spanish dance, and possibly they may
      carry off the piece with the public. The whole affair is a gambling
      speculation. A few clever notices in the papers, and I may make a hundred
      thousand crowns, if the play takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! come, it will only be a moderate success, I can see,&rdquo; said Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of the theatres have got up a plot,&rdquo; continued the manager; &ldquo;they
      will even hiss the piece, but I have made arrangements to defeat their
      kind intentions. I have squared the men in their pay; they will make a
      muddle of it. A couple of city men yonder have taken a hundred tickets
      apiece to secure a triumph for Florine and Coralie, and given them to
      acquaintances able and ready to act as chuckers out. The fellows, having
      been paid twice, will go quietly, and a scene of that sort always makes a
      good impression on the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred tickets! What invaluable men!&rdquo; exclaimed Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. With two more actresses as handsomely kept as Florine and Coralie, I
      should make something out of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the past two hours the word money had been sounding in Lucien&rsquo;s ears
      as the solution of every difficulty. In the theatre as in the publishing
      trade, and in the publishing trade as in the newspaper-office&mdash;it was
      everywhere the same; there was not a word of art or of glory. The steady
      beat of the great pendulum, Money, seemed to fall like hammer-strokes on
      his heart and brain. And yet while the orchestra played the overture,
      while the pit was full of noisy tumult of applause and hisses,
      unconsciously he drew a comparison between this scene and others that came
      up in his mind. Visions arose before him of David and the printing-office,
      of the poetry that he came to know in that atmosphere of pure peace, when
      together they beheld the wonders of Art, the high successes of genius, and
      visions of glory borne on stainless wings. He thought of the evenings
      spent with d&rsquo;Arthez and his friends, and tears glittered in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Etienne Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see poetry fallen into the mire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have still some illusions left, my dear fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing for it but to cringe and submit to thickheads like
      Matifat and Camusot, as actresses bow down to journalists, and we
      ourselves to the booksellers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, do you see that dull-brained fellow?&rdquo; said Etienne, lowering his
      voice, and glancing at Finot. &ldquo;He has neither genius nor cleverness, but
      he is covetous; he means to make a fortune at all costs, and he is a keen
      man of business. Didn&rsquo;t you see how he made forty per cent out of me at
      Dauriat&rsquo;s, and talked as if he were doing me a favor?&mdash;Well, he gets
      letters from not a few unknown men of genius who go down on their knees to
      him for a hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words recalled the pen-and-ink sketch that lay on the table in the
      editor&rsquo;s office and the words, &ldquo;Finot, my hundred francs!&rdquo; Lucien&rsquo;s inmost
      soul shrank from the man in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would sooner die,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner live,&rdquo; retorted Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain rose, and the stage-manager went off to the wings to give
      orders. Finot turned to Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, Dauriat has passed his word; I am proprietor of one-third
      of his weekly paper. I have agreed to give thirty thousand francs in cash,
      on condition that I am to be editor and director. &lsquo;Tis a splendid thing.
      Blondet told me that the Government intends to take restrictive measures
      against the press; there will be no new papers allowed; in six months&rsquo; 
      time it will cost a million francs to start a new journal, so I struck a
      bargain though I have only ten thousand francs in hand. Listen to me. If
      you can sell one-half of my share, that is one-sixth of the paper, to
      Matifat for thirty thousand francs, you shall be editor of my little paper
      with a salary of two hundred and fifty francs per month. I want in any
      case to have the control of my old paper, and to keep my hold upon it; but
      nobody need know that, and your name will appear as editor. You will be
      paid at the rate of five francs per column; you need not pay contributors
      more than three francs, and you keep the difference. That means another
      four hundred and fifty francs per month. But, at the same time, I reserve
      the right to use the paper to attack or defend men or causes, as I please;
      and you may indulge your own likes and dislikes so long as you do not
      interfere with my schemes. Perhaps I may be a Ministerialist, perhaps
      Ultra, I do not know yet; but I mean to keep up my connections with the
      Liberal party (below the surface). I can speak out with you; you are a
      good fellow. I might, perhaps, give you the Chambers to do for another
      paper on which I work; I am afraid I can scarcely keep on with it now. So
      let Florine do this bit of jockeying; tell her to put the screw on her
      druggist. If I can&rsquo;t find the money within forty-eight hours, I must cry
      off my bargain. Dauriat sold another third to his printer and paper-dealer
      for thirty thousand francs; so he has his own third <i>gratis</i>, and ten
      thousand francs to the good, for he only gave fifty thousand for the whole
      affair. And in another year&rsquo;s time the magazine will be worth two hundred
      thousand francs, if the Court buys it up; if the Court has the good sense
      to suppress newspapers, as they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had gone through all that I have endured, you would not say that
      of me. I had my fill of misery in those days, you see, and there was no
      help for it. My father is a hatter; he still keeps a shop in the Rue du
      Coq. Nothing but millions of money or a social cataclysm can open out the
      way to my goal; and of the two alternatives, I don&rsquo;t know now that the
      revolution is not the easier. If I bore your friend&rsquo;s name, I should have
      a chance to get on. Hush, here comes the manager. Good-bye,&rdquo; and Finot
      rose to his feet, &ldquo;I am going to the Opera. I shall very likely have a
      duel on my hands to-morrow, for I have put my initials to a terrific
      attack on a couple of dancers under the protection of two Generals. I am
      giving it them hot and strong at the Opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha?&rdquo; said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They are stingy with me,&rdquo; returned Finot, &ldquo;now cutting off a box,
      and now declining to take fifty subscriptions. I have sent in my <i>ultimatum</i>;
      I mean to have a hundred subscriptions out of them and a box four times a
      month. If they take my terms, I shall have eight hundred readers and a
      thousand paying subscribers, so we shall have twelve hundred with the New
      Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will end by ruining us,&rdquo; said the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are not much hurt with your ten subscriptions. I had two good
      notices put into the <i>Constitutionnel</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not complaining of you,&rdquo; cried the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye till to-morrow evening, Lousteau,&rdquo; said Finot. &ldquo;You can give me
      your answer at the Francais; there is a new piece on there; and as I shall
      not be able to write the notice, you can take my box. I will give you
      preference; you have worked yourself to death for me, and I am grateful.
      Felicien Vernou offered twenty thousand francs for a third share of my
      little paper, and to work without a salary for a twelvemonth; but I want
      to be absolute master. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not named Finot&rdquo; (<i>finaud</i>, slyboots) &ldquo;for nothing,&rdquo; said
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a gallows-bird that will get on in the world,&rdquo; said Etienne,
      careless whether the wily schemer overheard the remark or not, as he shut
      the door of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i>!&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;He will be a millionaire; he will enjoy
      the respect of all who know him; he may perhaps have friends some day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what a den!&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;And are you going to drag that
      excellent creature into such a business?&rdquo; he continued, looking at
      Florine, who gave them side glances from the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will carry it through too. You do not know the devotion and the wiles
      of these beloved beings,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They redeem their failings and expiate all their sins by boundless love,
      when they love,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;A great love is all the grander in an
      actress by reason of its violent contrast with her surroundings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he who finds it, finds a diamond worthy of the proudest crown lying
      in the mud,&rdquo; returned Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Coralie is not attending to her part,&rdquo; remarked the manager. &ldquo;Coralie
      is smitten with our friend here, all unsuspicious of his conquest, and
      Coralie will make a fiasco; she is missing her cues, this is the second
      time she had not heard the prompter. Pray, go into the corner, monsieur,&rdquo;
       he continued. &ldquo;If Coralie is smitten with you, I will go and tell her that
      you have left the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; cried Lousteau; &ldquo;tell Coralie that this gentleman is coming to
      supper, and that she can do as she likes with him, and she will play like
      Mlle. Mars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manager went, and Lucien turned to Etienne. &ldquo;What! do you mean to say
      that you will ask that druggist, through Mlle. Florine, to pay thirty
      thousand francs for one-half a share, when Finot gave no more for the
      whole of it? And ask without the slightest scruple?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau interrupted Lucien before he had time to finish his
      expostulation. &ldquo;My dear boy, what country can you come from? The druggist
      is not a man; he is a strong box delivered into our hands by his fancy for
      an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conscience, my dear fellow, is a stick which every one takes up to beat
      his neighbor and not for application to his own back. Come, now! who the
      devil are you angry with? In one day chance has worked a miracle for you,
      a miracle for which I have been waiting these two years, and you must
      needs amuse yourself by finding fault with the means? What! you appear to
      me to possess intelligence; you seem to be in a fair way to reach that
      freedom from prejudice which is a first necessity to intellectual
      adventurers in the world we live in; and are you wallowing in scruples
      worthy of a nun who accuses herself of eating an egg with
      concupiscence?... If Florine succeeds, I shall be editor of a newspaper
      with a fixed salary of two hundred and fifty francs per month; I shall
      take the important plays and leave the vaudevilles to Vernou, and you can
      take my place and do the Boulevard theatres, and so get a foot in the
      stirrup. You will make three francs per column and write a column a day&mdash;thirty
      columns a month means ninety francs; you will have some sixty francs worth
      of books to sell to Barbet; and lastly, you can demand ten tickets a month
      of each of your theatres&mdash;that is, forty tickets in all&mdash;and
      sell them for forty francs to a Barbet who deals in them (I will introduce
      you to the man), so you will have two hundred francs coming in every
      month. Then if you make yourself useful to Finot, you might get a hundred
      francs for an article in this new weekly review of his, in which case you
      would show uncommon talent, for all the articles are signed, and you
      cannot put in slip-shod work as you can on a small paper. In that case you
      would be making a hundred crowns a month. Now, my dear boy, there are men
      of ability, like that poor d&rsquo;Arthez, who dines at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s every day,
      who may wait for ten years before they will make a hundred crowns; and you
      will be making four thousand francs a year by your pen, to say nothing of
      the books you will write for the trade, if you do work of that kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, a sub-prefect&rsquo;s salary only amounts to a thousand crowns, and there
      he stops in his arrondissement, wearing away time like the rung of a
      chair. I say nothing of the pleasure of going to the theatre without
      paying for your seat, for that is a delight which quickly palls; but you
      can go behind the scenes in four theatres. Be hard and sarcastic for a
      month or two, and you will be simply overwhelmed with invitations from
      actresses, and their adorers will pay court to you; you will only dine at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s when you happen to have less than thirty sous in your pocket
      and no dinner engagement. At the Luxembourg, at five o&rsquo;clock, you did not
      know which way to turn; now, you are on the eve of entering a privileged
      class, you will be one of the hundred persons who tell France what to
      think. In three days&rsquo; time, if all goes well, you can, if you choose, make
      a man&rsquo;s life a curse to him by putting thirty jokes at his expense in
      print at the rate of three a day; you can, if you choose, draw a revenue
      of pleasure from the actresses at your theatres; you can wreck a good play
      and send all Paris running after a bad one. If Dauriat declines to pay you
      for your <i>Marguerites</i>, you can make him come to you, and meekly and
      humbly implore you to take two thousand francs for them. If you have the
      ability, and knock off two or three articles that threaten to spoil some
      of Dauriat&rsquo;s speculations, or to ruin a book on which he counts, you will
      see him come climbing up your stairs like a clematis, and always at the
      door of your dwelling. As for your novel, the booksellers who would show
      you more or less politely to the door at this moment will be standing
      outside your attic in a string, and the value of the manuscript, which old
      Doguereau valued at four hundred francs will rise to four thousand. These
      are the advantages of the journalist&rsquo;s profession. So let us do our best
      to keep all newcomers out of it. It needs an immense amount of brains to
      make your way, and a still greater amount of luck. And here are you
      quibbling over your good fortune! If we had not met to-day, you see, at
      Flicoteaux&rsquo;s, you might have danced attendance on the booksellers for
      another three years, or starved like d&rsquo;Arthez in a garret. By the time
      that d&rsquo;Arthez is as learned as Bayle and as great a writer of prose as
      Rousseau, we shall have made our fortunes, you and I, and we shall hold
      his in our hands&mdash;wealth and fame to give or to hold. Finot will be a
      deputy and proprietor of a great newspaper, and we shall be whatever we
      meant to be&mdash;peers of France, or prisoner for debt in
      Sainte-Pelagie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Finot will sell his paper to the highest bidder among the Ministers,
      just as he sells favorable notices to Mme. Bastienne and runs down Mlle.
      Virginie, saying that Mme. Bastienne&rsquo;s bonnets are superior to the
      millinery which they praised at first!&rdquo; said Lucien, recollecting that
      scene in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you are a simpleton,&rdquo; Lousteau remarked drily. &ldquo;Three
      years ago Finot was walking on the uppers of his boots, dining for
      eighteen sous at Tabar&rsquo;s, and knocking off a tradesman&rsquo;s prospectus (when
      he could get it) for ten francs. His clothes hung together by some miracle
      as mysterious as the Immaculate Conception. <i>Now</i>, Finot has a paper
      of his own, worth about a hundred thousand francs. What with subscribers
      who pay and take no copies, genuine subscriptions, and indirect taxes
      levied by his uncle, he is making twenty thousand francs a year. He dines
      most sumptuously every day; he has set up a cabriolet within the last
      month; and now, at last, behold him the editor of a weekly review with a
      sixth share, for which he will not pay a penny, a salary of five hundred
      francs per month, and another thousand francs for supplying matter which
      costs him nothing, and for which the firm pays. You yourself, to begin
      with, if Finot consents to pay you fifty francs per sheet, will be only
      too glad to let him have two or three articles for nothing. When you are
      in his position, you can judge Finot; a man can only be tried by his
      peers. And for you, is there not an immense future opening out before you,
      if you will blindly minister to his enmity, attack at Finot&rsquo;s bidding, and
      praise when he gives the word? Suppose that you yourself wish to be
      revenged upon somebody, you can break a foe or friend on the wheel. You
      have only to say to me, &lsquo;Lousteau, let us put an end to So-and-so,&rsquo; and we
      will kill him by a phrase put in the paper morning by morning; and
      afterwards you can slay the slain with a solemn article in Finot&rsquo;s weekly.
      Indeed, if it is a matter of capital importance to you, Finot would allow
      you to bludgeon your man in a big paper with ten or twelve thousand
      subscribers, <i>if</i> you make yourself indispensable to Finot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then are you sure that Florine can bring her druggist to make the
      bargain?&rdquo; asked Lucien, dazzled by these prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. Now comes the interval, I will go and tell her everything at
      once in a word or two; it will be settled to-night. If Florine once has
      her lesson by heart, she will have all my wit and her own besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there sits that honest tradesman, gaping with open-mouthed admiration
      at Florine, little suspecting that you are about to get thirty thousand
      francs out of him!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More twaddle! Anybody might think that the man was going to be robbed!&rdquo;
       cried Lousteau. &ldquo;Why, my dear boy, if the minister buys the newspaper, the
      druggist may make twenty thousand francs in six months on an investment of
      thirty thousand. Matifat is not looking at the newspaper, but at Florine&rsquo;s
      prospects. As soon as it is known that Matifat and Camusot&mdash;(for they
      will go shares)&mdash;that Matifat and Camusot are proprietors of a
      review, the newspapers will be full of friendly notices of Florine and
      Coralie. Florine&rsquo;s name will be made; she will perhaps obtain an
      engagement in another theatre with a salary of twelve thousand francs. In
      fact, Matifat will save a thousand francs every month in dinners and
      presents to journalists. You know nothing of men, nor of the way things
      are managed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;he is looking forward to an evening&rsquo;s pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will be sawn in two with arguments until Florine sees Finot&rsquo;s
      receipt for a sixth share of the paper. And to-morrow I shall be editor of
      Finot&rsquo;s paper, and making a thousand francs a month. The end of my
      troubles is in sight!&rdquo; cried Florine&rsquo;s lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau went out, and Lucien sat like one bewildered, lost in the
      infinite of thought, soaring above this everyday world. In the Wooden
      Galleries he had seen the wires by which the trade in books is moved; he
      has seen something of the kitchen where great reputations are made; he had
      been behind the scenes; he had seen the seamy side of life, the
      consciences of men involved in the machinery of Paris, the mechanism of it
      all. As he watched Florine on the stage he almost envied Lousteau his good
      fortune; already, for a few moments he had forgotten Matifat in the
      background. He was not left alone for long, perhaps for not more than five
      minutes, but those minutes seemed an eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts rose within him that set his soul on fire, as the spectacle on
      the stage had heated his senses. He looked at the women with their wanton
      eyes, all the brighter for the red paint on their cheeks, at the gleaming
      bare necks, the luxuriant forms outlined by the lascivious folds of the
      basquina, the very short skirts, that displayed as much as possible of
      limbs encased in scarlet stockings with green clocks to them&mdash;a
      disquieting vision for the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A double process of corruption was working within him in parallel lines,
      like two channels that will spread sooner or later in flood time and make
      one. That corruption was eating into Lucien&rsquo;s soul, as he leaned back in
      his corner, staring vacantly at the curtain, one arm resting on the
      crimson velvet cushion, and his hand drooping over the edge. He felt the
      fascination of the life that was offered to him, of the gleams of light
      among its clouds; and this so much the more keenly because it shone out
      like a blaze of fireworks against the blank darkness of his own obscure,
      monotonous days of toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his listless eyes became aware of a burning glance that reached
      him through a rent in the curtain, and roused him from his lethargy. Those
      were Coralie&rsquo;s eyes that glowed upon him. He lowered his head and looked
      across at Camusot, who just then entered the opposite box.
    </p>
    <p>
      That amateur was a worthy silk-mercer of the Rue des Bourdonnais, stout
      and substantial, a judge in the commercial court, a father of four
      children, and the husband of a second wife. At the age of fifty-six, with
      a cap of gray hair on his head, he had the smug appearance of a man who
      has his eighty thousand francs of income; and having been forced to put up
      with a good deal that he did not like in the way of business, has fully
      made up his mind to enjoy the rest of his life, and not to quit this earth
      until he has had his share of cakes and ale. A brow the color of fresh
      butter and florid cheeks like a monk&rsquo;s jowl seemed scarcely big enough to
      contain his exuberant jubilation. Camusot had left his wife at home, and
      they were applauding Coralie to the skies. All the rich man&rsquo;s citizen
      vanity was summed up and gratified in Coralie; in Coralie&rsquo;s lodging he
      gave himself the airs of a great lord of a bygone day; now, at this
      moment, he felt that half of her success was his; the knowledge that he
      had paid for it confirmed him in this idea. Camusot&rsquo;s conduct was
      sanctioned by the presence of his father-in-law, a little old fogy with
      powdered hair and leering eyes, highly respected nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Lucien felt disgust rising within him. He thought of the year when
      he loved Mme. de Bargeton with an exalted and disinterested love; and at
      that thought love, as a poet understands it, spread its white wings about
      him; countless memories drew a circle of distant blue horizon about the
      great man of Angouleme, and again he fell to dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went the curtain, and there stood Coralie and Florine upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thinking about as much of you as of the Grand Turk, my dear girl,&rdquo;
       Florine said in an aside while Coralie was finishing her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien could not help laughing. He looked at Coralie. She was one of the
      most charming and captivating actresses in Paris, rivaling Mme. Perrin and
      Mlle. Fleuriet, and destined likewise to share their fate. Coralie was a
      woman of a type that exerts at will a power of fascination over men. With
      an oval face of deep ivory tint, a mouth red as a pomegranate, and a chin
      subtly delicate in its contour as the edge of a porcelain cup, Coralie was
      a Jewess of the sublime type. The jet black eyes behind their curving
      lashes seemed to scorch her eyelids; you could guess how soft they might
      grow, or how sparks of the heat of the desert might flash from them in
      response to a summons from within. The circles of olive shadow about them
      were bounded by thick arching lines of eyebrow. Magnificent mental power,
      well-nigh amounting to genius, seemed to dwell in the swarthy forehead
      beneath the double curve of ebony hair that lay upon it like a crown, and
      gleamed in the light like a varnished surface; but like many another
      actress, Coralie had little wit in spite of her aptness at greenroom
      repartee, and scarcely any education in spite of her boudoir experience.
      Her brain was prompted by her senses, her kindness was the impulsive
      warm-heartedness of girls of her class. But who could trouble over
      Coralie&rsquo;s psychology when his eyes were dazzled by those smooth, round
      arms of hers, the spindle-shaped fingers, the fair white shoulders, and
      breast celebrated in the Song of Songs, the flexible curving lines of
      throat, the graciously moulded outlines beneath the scarlet silk
      stockings? And this beauty, worthy of an Eastern poet, was brought into
      relief by the conventional Spanish costume of the stage. Coralie was the
      delight of the pit; all eyes dwelt on the outlines moulded by the clinging
      folds of her bodice, and lingered over the Andalusian contour of the hips
      from which her skirt hung, fluttering wantonly with every movement. To
      Lucien, watching this creature, who played for him alone, caring no more
      for Camusot than a street-boy in the gallery cares for an apple-paring,
      there came a moment when he set desire above love, and enjoyment above
      desire, and the demon of Lust stirred strange thoughts in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of the love that wallows in luxury and wine and sensual
      pleasure,&rdquo; he said within himself. &ldquo;I have lived more with ideas than with
      realities. You must pass through all experience if you mean to render all
      experience. This will be my first great supper, my first orgy in a new and
      strange world; why should I not know, for once, the delights which the
      great lords of the eighteenth century sought so eagerly of wantons of the
      Opera? Must one not first learn of courtesans and actresses the delights,
      the perfections, the transports, the resources, the subtleties of love, if
      only to translate them afterwards into the regions of a higher love than
      this? And what is all this, after all, but the poetry of the senses? Two
      months ago these women seemed to me to be goddesses guarded by dragons
      that no one dared approach; I was envying Lousteau just now, but here is
      another handsomer than Florine; why should I not profit by her fancy, when
      the greatest nobles buy a night with such women with their richest
      treasures? When ambassadors set foot in these depths, they fling aside all
      thought of yesterday or to-morrow. I should be a fool to be more squeamish
      than princes, especially as I love no one as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had quite forgotten Camusot. To Lousteau he had expressed the
      utmost disgust for this most hateful of all partitions, and now he himself
      had sunk to the same level, and, carried away by the casuistry of his
      vehement desire, had given the reins to his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie is raving about you,&rdquo; said Lousteau as he came in. &ldquo;Your
      countenance, worthy of the greatest Greek sculptors, has worked
      unutterable havoc behind the scenes. You are in luck my dear boy. Coralie
      is eighteen years old, and in a few days&rsquo; time she may be making sixty
      thousand francs a year by her beauty. She is an honest girl still. Since
      her mother sold her three years ago for sixty thousand francs, she has
      tried to find happiness, and found nothing but annoyance. She took to the
      stage in a desperate mood; she has a horror of her first purchaser, de
      Marsay; and when she came out of the galleys, for the king of dandies soon
      dropped her, she picked up old Camusot. She does not care much about him,
      but he is like a father to her, and she endures him and his love. Several
      times already she has refused the handsomest proposals; she is faithful to
      Camusot, who lets her live in peace. So you are her first love. The first
      sight of you went to her heart like a pistol-shot, Florine has gone to her
      dressing-room to bring the girl to reason. She is crying over your
      cruelty; she has forgotten her part, the play will go to pieces, and
      good-day to the engagement at the Gymnase which Camusot had planned for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!... Poor thing!&rdquo; said Lucien. Every instinct of vanity was tickled
      by the words; he felt his heart swell high with self-conceit. &ldquo;More
      adventures have befallen me in this one evening, my dear fellow, than in
      all the first eighteen years of my life.&rdquo; And Lucien related the history
      of his love affairs with Mme. de Bargeton, and of the cordial hatred he
      bore the Baron du Chatelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay though! the newspaper wants a <i>bete noire</i>; we will take him
      up. The Baron is a buck of the Empire and a Ministerialist; he is the man
      for us; I have seen him many a time at the Opera. I can see your great
      lady as I sit here; she is often in the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s box. The Baron
      is paying court to your lady love, a cuttlefish bone that she is. Wait!
      Finot has just sent a special messenger round to say that they are short
      of copy at the office. Young Hector Merlin has left them in the lurch
      because they did not pay for white lines. Finot, in despair, is knocking
      off an article against the Opera. Well now, my dear fellow, you can do
      this play; listen to it and think it over, and I will go to the manager&rsquo;s
      office and think out three columns about your man and your disdainful fair
      one. They will be in no pleasant predicament to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is how a newspaper is written?&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always like this,&rdquo; answered Lousteau. &ldquo;These ten months that I have
      been a journalist, they have always run short of copy at eight o&rsquo;clock in
      the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Manuscript sent to the printer is spoken of as &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; doubtless because
      the writers are supposed to send in a fair copy of their work; or possibly
      the word is ironically derived from the Latin word <i>copia</i>, for copy
      is invariably scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We always mean to have a few numbers ready in advance, a grand idea that
      will never be realized,&rdquo; continued Lousteau. &ldquo;It is ten o&rsquo;clock, you see,
      and not a line has been written. I shall ask Vernou and Nathan for a score
      of epigrams on deputies, or on &lsquo;Chancellor Cruzoe,&rsquo; or on the Ministry, or
      on friends of ours if it needs must be. A man in this pass would slaughter
      his parent, just as a privateer will load his guns with silver pieces
      taken out of the booty sooner than perish. Write a brilliant article, and
      you will make brilliant progress in Finot&rsquo;s estimation; for Finot has a
      lively sense of benefits to come, and that sort of gratitude is better
      than any kind of pledge, pawntickets always excepted, for they invariably
      represent something solid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of men can journalists be? Are you to sit down at a table and
      be witty to order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just exactly as a lamp begins to burn when you apply a match&mdash;so
      long as there is any oil in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau&rsquo;s hand was on the lock when du Bruel came in with the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, monsieur, to take a message to Coralie; allow me to tell her
      that you will go home with her after supper, or my play will be ruined.
      The wretched girl does not know what she is doing or saying; she will cry
      when she ought to laugh and laugh when she ought to cry. She has been
      hissed once already. You can still save the piece, and, after all,
      pleasure is not a misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not accustomed to rivals, sir,&rdquo; Lucien answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t tell her that!&rdquo; cried the manager. &ldquo;Coralie is just the girl
      to fling Camusot overboard and ruin herself in good earnest. The
      proprietor of the <i>Golden Cocoon</i>, worthy man, allows her two
      thousand francs a month, and pays for all her dresses and <i>claqueurs</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your promise pledges me to nothing, save your play,&rdquo; said Lucien, with
      a sultan&rsquo;s airs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t look as if you meant to snub that charming creature,&rdquo; pleaded
      du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! am I to write the notice of your play and smile on your heroine
      as well?&rdquo; exclaimed the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author vanished with a signal to Coralie, who began to act forthwith
      in a marvelous way. Vignol, who played the part of the alcalde, and
      revealed for the first time his genius as an actor of old men, came
      forward amid a storm of applause to make an announcement to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The piece which we have the honor of playing for you this evening,
      gentlemen, is the work of MM. Raoul and de Cursy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Nathan is partly responsible,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that
      he looked in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie<i>! Coralie</i>!&rdquo; shouted the enraptured house. &ldquo;Florine, too!&rdquo;
       roared a voice of thunder from the opposite box, and other voices took up
      the cry, &ldquo;Florine and Coralie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain rose, Vignol reappeared between the two actresses; Matifat and
      Camusot flung wreaths on the stage, and Coralie stooped for her flowers
      and held them out to Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      For him those two hours spent in the theatre seemed to be a dream. The
      spell that held him had begun to work when he went behind the scenes; and,
      in spite of its horrors, the atmosphere of the place, its sensuality and
      dissolute morals had affected the poet&rsquo;s still untainted nature. A sort of
      malaria that infects the soul seems to lurk among those dark, filthy
      passages filled with machinery, and lit with smoky, greasy lamps. The
      solemnity and reality of life disappear, the most sacred things are matter
      for a jest, the most impossible things seem to be true. Lucien felt as if
      he had taken some narcotic, and Coralie had completed the work. He plunged
      into this joyous intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights in the great chandelier were extinguished; there was no one
      left in the house except the boxkeepers, busy taking away footstools and
      shutting doors, the noises echoing strangely through the empty theatre.
      The footlights, blown out as one candle, sent up a fetid reek of smoke.
      The curtain rose again, a lantern was lowered from the ceiling, and
      firemen and stage carpenters departed on their rounds. The fairy scenes of
      the stage, the rows of fair faces in the boxes, the dazzling lights, the
      magical illusion of new scenery and costume had all disappeared, and
      dismal darkness, emptiness, and cold reigned in their stead. It was
      hideous. Lucien sat on in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! are you coming, my boy?&rdquo; Lousteau&rsquo;s voice called from the stage.
      &ldquo;Jump down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien sprang over. He scarcely recognized Florine and Coralie in their
      ordinary quilted paletots and cloaks, with their faces hidden by hats and
      thick black veils. Two butterflies returned to the chrysalis stage could
      not be more completely transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you honor me by giving me your arm?&rdquo; Coralie asked tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Lucien. He could feel the beating of her heart
      throbbing against his like some snared bird as she nestled closely to his
      side, with something of the delight of a cat that rubs herself against her
      master with eager silken caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we are supping together!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party of four found two cabs waiting for them at the door in the Rue
      des Fosses-du-Temple. Coralie drew Lucien to one of the two, in which
      Camusot and his father-in-law old Cardot were seated already. She offered
      du Bruel a fifth place, and the manager drove off with Florine, Matifat,
      and Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These hackney cabs are abominable things,&rdquo; said Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have a carriage?&rdquo; returned du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why</i>?&rdquo; she asked pettishly. &ldquo;I do not like to tell you before M.
      Cardot&rsquo;s face; for he trained his son-in-law, no doubt. Would you believe
      it, little and old as he is, M. Cardot only gives Florine five hundred
      francs a month, just about enough to pay for her rent and her grub and her
      clothes. The old Marquis de Rochegude offered me a brougham two months
      ago, and he has six hundred thousand francs a year, but I am an artist and
      not a common hussy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have a carriage the day after to-morrow, miss,&rdquo; said Camusot
      benignly; &ldquo;you never asked me for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if one <i>asked</i> for such a thing as that? What! you love a woman
      and let her paddle about in the mud at the risk of breaking her legs?
      Nobody but a knight of the yardstick likes to see a draggled skirt hem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered the sharp words that cut Camusot to the quick, she groped
      for Lucien&rsquo;s knee, and pressed it against her own, and clasped her fingers
      upon his hand. She was silent. All her power to feel seemed to be
      concentrated upon the ineffable joy of a moment which brings compensation
      for the whole wretched past of a life such as these poor creatures lead,
      and develops within their souls a poetry of which other women, happily
      ignorant of these violent revulsions, know nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You played like Mlle. Mars herself towards the end,&rdquo; said du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Camusot, &ldquo;something put her out at the beginning; but from the
      middle of the second act to the very end, she was enough to drive you wild
      with admiration. Half of the success of your play was due to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And half of her success is due to me,&rdquo; said du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all much ado about nothing,&rdquo; said Coralie in an unfamiliar voice.
      And, seizing an opportunity in the darkness, she carried Lucien&rsquo;s hand to
      her lips and kissed it and drenched it with tears. Lucien felt thrilled
      through and through by that touch, for in the humility of the courtesan&rsquo;s
      love there is a magnificence which might set an example to angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you writing the dramatic criticism, monsieur?&rdquo; said du Bruel,
      addressing Lucien; &ldquo;you can write a charming paragraph about our dear
      Coralie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do us that little service!&rdquo; pleaded Camusot, down on his knees,
      metaphorically speaking, before the critic. &ldquo;You will always find me ready
      to do you a good turn at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do leave him his independence,&rdquo; Coralie exclaimed angrily; &ldquo;he will write
      what he pleases. Papa Camusot, buy carriages for me instead of praises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have them on very easy terms,&rdquo; Lucien answered politely. &ldquo;I
      have never written for newspapers before, so I am not accustomed to their
      ways, my maiden pen is at your disposal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is funny,&rdquo; said du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are in the Rue de Bondy,&rdquo; said Cardot. Coralie&rsquo;s sally had quite
      crushed the little old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are giving me the first fruits of your pen, the first love that
      has sprung up in my heart shall be yours,&rdquo; whispered Coralie in the brief
      instant that they remained alone together in the cab; then she went up to
      Florine&rsquo;s bedroom to change her dress for a toilette previously sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had no idea how lavishly a prosperous merchant will spend money
      upon an actress or a mistress when he means to enjoy a life of pleasure.
      Matifat was not nearly so rich a man as his friend Camusot, and he had
      done his part rather shabbily, yet the sight of the dining-room took
      Lucien by surprise. The walls were hung with green cloth with a border of
      gilded nails, the whole room was artistically decorated, lighted by
      handsome lamps, stands full of flowers stood in every direction. The
      drawing-room was resplendent with the furniture in fashion in those days&mdash;a
      Thomire chandelier, a carpet of Eastern design, and yellow silken hangings
      relieved by a brown border. The candlesticks, fire-irons, and clock were
      all in good taste; for Matifat had left everything to Grindot, a rising
      architect, who was building a house for him, and the young man had taken
      great pains with the rooms when he knew that Florine was to occupy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matifat, a tradesman to the backbone, went about carefully, afraid to
      touch the new furniture; he seemed to have the totals of the bills always
      before his eyes, and to look upon the splendors about him as so much
      jewelry imprudently withdrawn from the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall be obliged to do as much for Florentine!&rdquo; old Cardot&rsquo;s eyes
      seemed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien at once began to understand Lousteau&rsquo;s indifference to the state of
      his garret. Etienne was the real king of these festivals; Etienne enjoyed
      the use of all these fine things. He was standing just now on the
      hearthrug with his back to the fire, as if he were the master of the
      house, chatting with the manager, who was congratulating du Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copy, copy!&rdquo; called Finot, coming into the room. &ldquo;There is nothing in the
      box; the printers are setting up my article, and they will soon have
      finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will manage,&rdquo; said Etienne. &ldquo;There is a fire burning in Florine&rsquo;s
      boudoir; there is a table there; and if M. Matifat will find us paper and
      ink, we will knock off the newspaper while Florine and Coralie are
      dressing.&rdquo;

      Cardot, Camusot, and Matifat disappeared in search of quills, penknives,
      and everything necessary. Suddenly the door was flung open, and Tullia,
      one of the prettiest opera-dancers of the day, dashed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They agree to take the hundred copies, dear boy!&rdquo; she cried, addressing
      Finot; &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t cost the management anything, for the chorus and the
      orchestra and the <i>corps de ballet</i> are to take them whether they
      like it or not; but your paper is so clever that nobody will grumble. And
      you are going to have your boxes. Here is the subscription for the first
      quarter,&rdquo; she continued, holding out a couple of banknotes; &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t cut
      me up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over with me!&rdquo; groaned Finot; &ldquo;I must suppress my abominable
      diatribe, and I haven&rsquo;t another notion in my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a happy inspiration, divine Lais!&rdquo; exclaimed Blondet, who had
      followed the lady upstairs and brought Nathan, Vernou and Claude Vignon
      with him. &ldquo;Stop to supper, there is a dear, or I will crush thee,
      butterfly as thou art. There will be no professional jealousies, as you
      are a dancer; and as to beauty, you have all of you too much sense to show
      jealousy in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; cried Finot, &ldquo;Nathan, Blondet, du Bruel, help friends! I want
      five columns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make two of the play,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have enough for one,&rdquo; added Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; Nathan, Vernou, and du Bruel will make the jokes at the end;
      and Blondet, good fellow, surely will vouchsafe a couple of short columns
      for the first sheet. I will run round to the printer. It is lucky that you
      brought your carriage, Tullia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the Duke is waiting below in it, and he has a German Minister
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the Duke and the Minister to come up,&rdquo; said Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A German? They are the ones to drink, and they listen too; he shall hear
      some astonishing things to send home to his Government,&rdquo; cried Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any sufficiently serious personage to go down to speak to him?&rdquo;
       asked Finot. &ldquo;Here, du Bruel, you are an official; bring up the Duc de
      Rhetore and the Minister, and give your arm to Tullia. Dear me! Tullia,
      how handsome you are to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be thirteen at table!&rdquo; exclaimed Matifat, paling visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, fourteen,&rdquo; said a voice in the doorway, and Florentine appeared. &ldquo;I
      have come to look after &lsquo;milord Cardot,&rsquo;&rdquo; she added, speaking with a
      burlesque English accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;Claude Vignon came with Blondet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought him here to drink,&rdquo; returned Blondet, taking up an inkstand.
      &ldquo;Look here, all of you, you must use all your wit before those fifty-six
      bottles of wine drive it out. And, of all things, stir up du Bruel; he is
      a vaudevillist, he is capable of making bad jokes if you get him to
      concert pitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lucien wrote his first newspaper article at the round table in
      Florine&rsquo;s boudoir, by the light of the pink candles lighted by Matifat;
      before such a remarkable audience he was eager to show what he could do.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    THE PANORAMA-DRAMATIQUE.

  First performance of the <i>Alcalde in a Fix</i>, an imbroglio in three
  acts.&mdash;First appearance of Mademoiselle Florine.&mdash;Mademoiselle
  Coralie.&mdash;Vignol.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  People are coming and going, walking and talking, everybody is
  looking for something, nobody finds anything. General hubbub. The
  Alcalde has lost his daughter and found his cap, but the cap does
  not fit; it must belong to some thief. Where is the thief? People
  walk and talk, and come and go more than ever. Finally the Alcalde
  finds a man without his daughter, and his daughter without the
  man, which is satisfactory for the magistrate, but not for the
  audience. Quiet being resorted, the Alcalde tries to examine the
  man. Behold a venerable Alcalde, sitting in an Alcalde&rsquo;s great
  armchair, arranging the sleeves of his Alcalde&rsquo;s gown. Only in
  Spain do Alcaldes cling to their enormous sleeves and wear plaited
  lawn ruffles about the magisterial throat, a good half of an
  Alcalde&rsquo;s business on the stage in Paris. This particular Alcalde,
  wheezing and waddling about like an asthmatic old man, is Vignol,
  on whom Potier&rsquo;s mantle has fallen; a young actor who personates
  old age so admirably that the oldest men in the audience cannot
  help laughing. With that quavering voice of his, that bald
  forehead, and those spindle shanks trembling under the weight of a
  senile frame, he may look forward to a long career of decrepitude.
  There is something alarming about the young actor&rsquo;s old age; he is
  so very old; you feel nervous lest senility should be infectious.
  And what an admirable Alcalde he makes! What a delightful, uneasy
  smile! what pompous stupidity! what wooden dignity! what judicial
  hesitation! How well the man knows that black may be white, or
  white black! How eminently well he is fitted to be Minister to a
  constitutional monarch! The stranger answers every one of his
  inquiries by a question; Vignol retorts in such a fashion, that
  the person under examination elicits all the truth from the
  Alcalde. This piece of pure comedy, with a breath of Moliere
  throughout, puts the house in good humor. The people on the stage
  all seemed to understand what they were about, but I am quite
  unable to clear up the mystery, or to say wherein it lay; for the
  Alcalde&rsquo;s daughter was there, personified by a living, breathing
  Andalusian, a Spaniard with a Spaniard&rsquo;s eyes, a Spaniard&rsquo;s
  complexion, a Spaniard&rsquo;s gait and figure, a Spaniard from top to
  toe, with her poniard in her garter, love in her heart, and a
  cross on the ribbon about her neck. When the act was over, and
  somebody asked me how the piece was going, I answered, &ldquo;She wears
  scarlet stockings with green clocks to them; she has a little
  foot, no larger than <i>that</i>, in her patent leather shoes, and the
  prettiest pair of ankles in Andalusia!&rdquo; Oh! that Alcalde&rsquo;s
  daughter brings your heart into your mouth; she tantalizes you so
  horribly, that you long to spring upon the stage and offer her
  your thatched hovel and your heart, or thirty thousand livres per
  annum and your pen. The Andalusian is the loveliest actress in
  Paris. Coralie, for she must be called by her real name, can be a
  countess or a <i>grisette</i>, and in which part she would be more
  charming one cannot tell. She can be anything that she chooses;
  she is born to achieve all possibilities; can more be said of a
  boulevard actress?

  With the second act, a Parisian Spaniard appeared upon the scene,
  with her features cut like a cameo and her dangerous eyes. &ldquo;Where
  does she come from?&rdquo; I asked in my turn, and was told that she
  came from the greenroom, and that she was Mademoiselle Florine;
  but, upon my word, I could not believe a syllable of it, such
  spirit was there in her gestures, such frenzy in her love. She is
  the rival of the Alcalde&rsquo;s daughter, and married to a grandee cut
  out to wear an Almaviva&rsquo;s cloak, with stuff sufficient in it for a
  hundred boulevard noblemen. Mlle. Florine wore neither scarlet
  stockings with green clocks, nor patent leather shoes, but she
  appeared in a mantilla, a veil which she put to admirable uses,
  like the great lady that she is! She showed to admiration that the
  tigress can be a cat. I began to understand, from the sparkling
  talk between the two, that some drama of jealousy was going on;
  and just as everything was put right, the Alcalde&rsquo;s stupidity
  embroiled everybody again. Torchbearers, rich men, footmen,
  Figaros, grandees, alcaldes, dames, and damsels&mdash;the whole company
  on the stage began to eddy about, and come and go, and look for
  one another. The plot thickened, again I left it to thicken; for
  Florine the jealous and the happy Coralie had entangled me once
  more in the folds of mantilla and basquina, and their little feet
  were twinkling in my eyes.

  I managed, however, to reach the third act without any mishap. The
  commissary of police was not compelled to interfere, and I did
  nothing to scandalize the house, wherefore I begin to believe in
  the influence of that &ldquo;public and religious morality,&rdquo; about which
  the Chamber of Deputies is so anxious, that any one might think
  there was no morality left in France. I even contrived to gather
  that a man was in love with two women who failed to return his
  affection, or else that two women were in love with a man who
  loved neither of them; the man did not love the Alcalde, or the
  Alcalde had no love for the man, who was nevertheless a gallant
  gentleman, and in love with somebody, with himself, perhaps, or
  with heaven, if the worst came to the worst, for he becomes a
  monk. And if you want to know any more, you can go to the
  Panorama-Dramatique. You are hereby given fair warning&mdash;you must
  go once to accustom yourself to those irresistible scarlet
  stockings with the green clocks, to little feet full of promises,
  to eyes with a ray of sunlight shining through them, to the subtle
  charm of a Parisienne disguised as an Andalusian girl, and of an
  Andalusian masquerading as a Parisienne. You must go a second time
  to enjoy the play, to shed tears over the love-distracted grandee,
  and die of laughing at the old Alcalde. The play is twice a
  success. The author, who writes it, it is said, in collaboration
  with one of the great poets of the day, was called before the
  curtain, and appeared with a love-distraught damsel on each arm,
  and fairly brought down the excited house. The two dancers seemed
  to have more wit in their legs than the author himself; but when
  once the fair rivals left the stage, the dialogue seemed witty at
  once, a triumphant proof of the excellence of the piece. The
  applause and calls for the author caused the architect some
  anxiety; but M. de Cursy, the author, being accustomed to volcanic
  eruptions of the reeling Vesuvius beneath the chandelier, felt no
  tremor. As for the actresses, they danced the famous bolero of
  Seville, which once found favor in the sight of a council of
  reverend fathers, and escaped ecclesiastical censure in spite of
  its wanton dangerous grace. The bolero in itself would be enough
  to attract old age while there is any lingering heat of youth in
  the veins, and out of charity I warn these persons to keep the
  lenses of their opera-glasses well polished.

    <p>
      While Lucien was writing a column which was to set a new fashion in
      journalism and reveal a fresh and original gift, Lousteau indited an
      article of the kind described as <i>moeurs</i>&mdash;a sketch of
      contemporary manners, entitled <i>The Elderly Beau</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buck of the Empire,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is invariably long, slender, and well
      preserved. He wears a corset and the Cross of the Legion of Honor. His
      name was originally Potelet, or something very like it; but to stand well
      with the Court, he conferred a <i>du</i> upon himself, and <i>du</i>
      Potelet he is until another revolution. A baron of the Empire, a man of
      two ends, as his name (<i>Potelet</i>, a post) implies, he is paying his
      court to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, after a youth gloriously and usefully
      spent as the agreeable trainbearer of a sister of the man whom decency
      forbids me to mention by name. Du Potelet has forgotten that he was once
      in waiting upon Her Imperial Highness; but he still sings the songs
      composed for the benefactress who took such a tender interest in his
      career,&rdquo; and so forth and so forth. It was a tissue of personalities,
      silly enough for the most part, such as they used to write in those days.
      Other papers, and notably the <i>Figaro</i>, have brought the art to a
      curious perfection since. Lousteau compared the Baron to a heron, and
      introduced Mme. de Bargeton, to whom he was paying his court, as a
      cuttlefish bone, a burlesque absurdity which amused readers who knew
      neither of the personages. A tale of the loves of the Heron, who tried in
      vain to swallow the Cuttlefish bone, which broke into three pieces when he
      dropped it, was irresistibly ludicrous. Everybody remembers the sensation
      which the pleasantry made in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; it was the first
      of a series of similar articles, and was one of the thousand and one
      causes which provoked the rigorous press legislation of Charles X.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Blondet, Lousteau, and Lucien came back to the
      drawing-room, where the other guests were chatting. The Duke was there and
      the Minister, the four women, the three merchants, the manager, and Finot.
      A printer&rsquo;s devil, with a paper cap on his head, was waiting even then for
      copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men are just going off, if I have nothing to take them,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a bit, here are ten francs, and tell them to wait,&rdquo; said Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I give them the money, sir, they would take to tippleography, and
      good-night to the newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s common-sense is appalling to me,&rdquo; remarked Finot; and the
      Minister was in the middle of a prediction of a brilliant future for the
      urchin, when the three came in. Blondet read aloud an extremely clever
      article against the Romantics; Lousteau&rsquo;s paragraph drew laughter, and by
      the Duc de Rhetore&rsquo;s advice an indirect eulogium of Mme. d&rsquo;Espard was
      slipped in, lest the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain should take offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have <i>you</i> written?&rdquo; asked Finot, turning to Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lucien read, quaking for fear, but the room rang with applause when he
      finished; the actresses embraced the neophyte; and the two merchants,
      following suit, half choked the breath out of him. There were tears in du
      Bruel&rsquo;s eyes as he grasped his critic&rsquo;s hand, and the manager invited him
      to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no children nowadays,&rdquo; said Blondet. &ldquo;Since M. de Chateaubriand
      called Victor Hugo a &lsquo;sublime child,&rsquo; I can only tell you quite simply
      that you have spirit and taste, and write like a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is on the newspaper,&rdquo; said Finot, as he thanked Etienne, and gave him
      a shrewd glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What jokes have you made?&rdquo; inquired Lousteau, turning to Blondet and du
      Bruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are du Bruel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Nathan.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *** &ldquo;Now, that M. le Vicomte d&rsquo;A&mdash;&mdash; is attracting so much
  attention, they will perhaps let <i>me</i> alone,&rdquo; M. le Vicomte
  Demosthenes was heard to say yesterday.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *** An Ultra, condemning M. Pasquier&rsquo;s speech, said his programme
  was only a continuation of Decaze&rsquo;s policy. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a lady,
  &ldquo;but he stands on a Monarchical basis, he has just the kind of leg
  for a Court suit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With such a beginning, I don&rsquo;t ask more of you,&rdquo; said Finot; &ldquo;it will be
      all right.&mdash;Run round with this,&rdquo; he added, turning to the boy; &ldquo;the
      paper is not exactly a genuine article, but it is our best number yet,&rdquo;
       and he turned to the group of writers. Already Lucien&rsquo;s colleagues were
      privately taking his measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow has brains,&rdquo; said Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His article is well written,&rdquo; said Claude Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper!&rdquo; cried Matifat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke gave his arm to Florine, Coralie went across to Lucien, and
      Tullia went in to supper between Emile Blondet and the German Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand why you are making an onslaught on Mme. de Bargeton
      and the Baron du Chatelet; they say that he is prefect-designate of the
      Charente, and will be Master of Requests some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. de Bargeton showed Lucien the door as if he had been an imposter,&rdquo;
       said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a fine young fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed the Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper, served with new plate, Sevres porcelain, and white damask, was
      redolent of opulence. The dishes were from Chevet, the wines from a
      celebrated merchant on the Quai Saint-Bernard, a personal friend of
      Matifat&rsquo;s. For the first time Lucien beheld the luxury of Paris displayed;
      he went from surprise to surprise, but he kept his astonishment to
      himself, like a man who had spirit and taste and wrote like a gentleman,
      as Blondet had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the drawing-room, Coralie bent to Florine, &ldquo;Make Camusot
      so drunk that he will be compelled to stop here all night,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have hooked your journalist, have you?&rdquo; returned Florine, using
      the idiom of women of her class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear; I love him,&rdquo; said Coralie, with an adorable little shrug of the
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words rang in Lucien&rsquo;s ears, borne to them by the fifth deadly sin.
      Coralie was perfectly dressed. Every woman possesses some personal charm
      in perfection, and Coralie&rsquo;s toilette brought her characteristic beauty
      into prominence. Her dress, moreover, like Florine&rsquo;s, was of some
      exquisite stuff, unknown as yet to the public, a <i>mousseline de soie</i>,
      with which Camusot had been supplied a few days before the rest of the
      world; for, as owner of the <i>Golden Cocoon</i>, he was a kind of
      Providence in Paris to the Lyons silkweavers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love and toilet are like color and perfume for a woman, and Coralie in her
      happiness looked lovelier than ever. A looked-for delight which cannot
      elude the grasp possesses an immense charm for youth; perhaps in their
      eyes the secret of the attraction of a house of pleasure lies in the
      certainty of gratification; perhaps many a long fidelity is attributable
      to the same cause. Love for love&rsquo;s sake, first love indeed, had blent with
      one of the strange violent fancies which sometimes possess these poor
      creatures; and love and admiration of Lucien&rsquo;s great beauty taught Coralie
      to express the thoughts in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love you if you were ill and ugly,&rdquo; she whispered as they sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a saying for a poet! Camusot utterly vanished, Lucien had forgotten
      his existence, he saw Coralie, and had eyes for nothing else. How should
      he draw back&mdash;this creature, all sensation, all enjoyment of life,
      tired of the monotony of existence in a country town, weary of poverty,
      harassed by enforced continence, impatient of the claustral life of the
      Rue de Cluny, of toiling without reward? The fascination of the under
      world of Paris was upon him; how should he rise and leave this brilliant
      gathering? Lucien stood with one foot in Coralie&rsquo;s chamber and the other
      in the quicksands of Journalism. After so much vain search, and climbing
      of so many stairs, after standing about and waiting in the Rue de Sentier,
      he had found Journalism a jolly boon companion, joyous over the wine. His
      wrongs had just been avenged. There were two for whom he had vainly
      striven to fill the cup of humiliation and pain which he had been made to
      drink to the dregs, and now to-morrow they should receive a stab in their
      very hearts. &ldquo;Here is a real friend!&rdquo; he thought, as he looked at
      Lousteau. It never crossed his mind that Lousteau already regarded him as
      a dangerous rival. He had made a blunder; he had done his very best when a
      colorless article would have served him admirably well. Blondet&rsquo;s remark
      to Finot that it would be better to come to terms with a man of that
      calibre, had counteracted Lousteau&rsquo;s gnawing jealousy. He reflected that
      it would be prudent to keep on good terms with Lucien, and, at the same
      time, to arrange with Finot to exploit this formidable newcomer&mdash;he
      must be kept in poverty. The decision was made in a moment, and the
      bargain made in a few whispered words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will want the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A supper among French journalists always fills me with dread,&rdquo; said the
      German diplomatist, with serene urbanity; he looked as he spoke at
      Blondet, whom he had met at the Comtesse de Montcornet&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It is laid upon
      you, gentlemen, to fulfil a prophecy of Blucher&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What prophecy?&rdquo; asked Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Blucher and Sacken arrived on the heights of Montmartre in 1814
      (pardon me, gentlemen, for recalling a day unfortunate for France), Sacken
      (a rough brute), remarked, &lsquo;Now we will set Paris alight!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Take
      very good care that you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Blucher. &lsquo;France will die of <i>that</i>,
      nothing else can kill her,&rsquo; and he waved his hand over the glowing,
      seething city, that lay like a huge canker in the valley of the Seine.&mdash;There
      are no journalists in our country, thank Heaven!&rdquo; continued the Minister
      after a pause. &ldquo;I have not yet recovered from the fright that the little
      fellow gave me, a boy of ten, in a paper cap, with the sense of an old
      diplomatist. And to-night I feel as if I were supping with lions and
      panthers, who graciously sheathe their claws in my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; said Blondet, &ldquo;that we are at liberty to inform Europe that
      a serpent dropped from your Excellency&rsquo;s lips this evening, and that the
      venomous creature failed to inoculate Mlle. Tullia, the prettiest dancer
      in Paris; and to follow up the story with a commentary on Eve, and the
      Scriptures, and the first and last transgression. But have no fear, you
      are our guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be funny,&rdquo; said Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would begin with a scientific treatise on all the serpents found in
      the human heart and human body, and so proceed to the <i>corps
      diplomatique</i>,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we could exhibit one in spirits, in a bottle of brandied cherries,&rdquo;
       said Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till you yourself would end by believing in the story,&rdquo; added Vignon,
      looking at the diplomatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried the Duc de Rhetore, &ldquo;let sleeping claws lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The influence and power of the press is only dawning,&rdquo; said Finot.
      &ldquo;Journalism is in its infancy; it will grow. In ten years&rsquo; time,
      everything will be brought into publicity. The light of thought will be
      turned on all subjects, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blight of thought will be over it all,&rdquo; corrected Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an apothegm,&rdquo; cried Claude Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought will make kings,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And undo monarchs,&rdquo; said the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; said Blondet, &ldquo;if the press did not exist, it would be
      necessary to invent it forthwith. But here we have it, and live by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will die of it,&rdquo; returned the German diplomatist. &ldquo;Can you not see
      that if you enlighten the masses, and raise them in the political scale,
      you make it all the harder for the individual to rise above their level?
      Can you not see that if you sow the seeds of reasoning among the
      working-classes, you will reap revolt, and be the first to fall victims?
      What do they smash in Paris when a riot begins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The street-lamps!&rdquo; said Nathan; &ldquo;but we are too modest to fear for
      ourselves, we only run the risk of cracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a nation, you have too much mental activity to allow any government to
      run its course without interference. But for that, you would make the
      conquest of Europe a second time, and win with the pen all that you failed
      to keep with the sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalism is an evil,&rdquo; said Claude Vignon. &ldquo;The evil may have its uses,
      but the present Government is resolved to put it down. There will be a
      battle over it. Who will give way? That is the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Government will give way,&rdquo; said Blondet. &ldquo;I keep telling people that
      with all my might! Intellectual power is <i>the</i> great power in France;
      and the press has more wit than all men of intellect put together, and the
      hypocrisy of Tartufe besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondet! Blondet! you are going too far!&rdquo; called Finot. &ldquo;Subscribers are
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the proprietor of one of those poison shops; you have reason to
      be afraid; but I can laugh at the whole business, even if I live by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondet is right,&rdquo; said Claude Vignon. &ldquo;Journalism, so far from being in
      the hands of a priesthood, came to be first a party weapon, and then a
      commercial speculation, carried on without conscience or scruple, like
      other commercial speculations. Every newspaper, as Blondet says, is a shop
      to which people come for opinions of the right shade. If there were a
      paper for hunchbacks, it would set forth plainly, morning and evening, in
      its columns, the beauty, the utility, and necessity of deformity. A
      newspaper is not supposed to enlighten its readers, but to supply them
      with congenial opinions. Give any newspaper time enough, and it will be
      base, hypocritical, shameless, and treacherous; the periodical press will
      be the death of ideas, systems, and individuals; nay, it will flourish
      upon their decay. It will take the credit of all creations of the brain;
      the harm that it does is done anonymously. We, for instance&mdash;I,
      Claude Vignon; you, Blondet; you, Lousteau; and you, Finot&mdash;we are
      all Platos, Aristides, and Catos, Plutarch&rsquo;s men, in short; we are all
      immaculate; we may wash our hands of all iniquity. Napoleon&rsquo;s sublime
      aphorism, suggested by his study of the Convention, &lsquo;No one individual is
      responsible for a crime committed collectively,&rsquo; sums up the whole
      significance of a phenomenon, moral or immoral, whichever you please.
      However shamefully a newspaper may behave, the disgrace attaches to no one
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The authorities will resort to repressive legislation,&rdquo; interposed du
      Bruel. &ldquo;A law is going to be passed, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; retorted Nathan. &ldquo;What is the law in France against the spirit in
      which it is received, the most subtle of all solvents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideas and opinions can only be counteracted by opinions and ideas,&rdquo;
       Vignon continued. &ldquo;By sheer terror and despotism, and by no other means,
      can you extinguish the genius of the French nation; for the language lends
      itself admirably to allusion and ambiguity. Epigram breaks out the more
      for repressive legislation; it is like steam in an engine without a
      safety-valve.&mdash;The King, for example, does right; if a newspaper is
      against him, the Minister gets all the credit of the measure, and <i>vice
      versa</i>. A newspaper invents a scandalous libel&mdash;it has been
      misinformed. If the victim complains, the paper gets off with an apology
      for taking so great a freedom. If the case is taken into court, the editor
      complains that nobody asked him to rectify the mistake; but ask for
      redress, and he will laugh in your face and treat his offence as a mere
      trifle. The paper scoffs if the victim gains the day; and if heavy damages
      are awarded, the plaintiff is held up as an unpatriotic obscurantist and a
      menace to the liberties of the country. In the course of an article
      purporting to explain that Monsieur So-and-so is as honest a man as you
      will find in the kingdom, you are informed that he is not better than a
      common thief. The sins of the press? Pooh! mere trifles; the curtailers of
      its liberties are monsters; and give him time enough, the constant reader
      is persuaded to believe anything you please. Everything which does not
      suit the newspaper will be unpatriotic, and the press will be infallible.
      One religion will be played off against another, and the Charter against
      the King. The press will hold up the magistracy to scorn for meting out
      rigorous justice to the press, and applaud its action when it serves the
      cause of party hatred. The most sensational fictions will be invented to
      increase the circulation; Journalism will descend to mountebanks&rsquo; tricks
      worthy of Bobeche; Journalism would serve up its father with the Attic
      salt of its own wit sooner than fail to interest or amuse the public;
      Journalism will outdo the actor who put his son&rsquo;s ashes into the urn to
      draw real tears from his eyes, or the mistress who sacrifices everything
      to her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalism is, in fact, the People in folio form,&rdquo; interrupted Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people with hypocrisy added and generosity lacking,&rdquo; said Vignon.
      &ldquo;All real ability will be driven out from the ranks of Journalism, as
      Aristides was driven into exile by the Athenians. We shall see newspapers
      started in the first instance by men of honor, falling sooner or later
      into the hands of men of abilities even lower than the average, but
      endowed with the resistance of flexibility of india-rubber, qualities
      denied to noble genius; nay, perhaps the future newspaper proprietor will
      be the tradesman with capital sufficient to buy venal pens. We see such
      things already indeed, but in ten years&rsquo; time every little youngster that
      has left school will take himself for a great man, slash his predecessors
      from the lofty height of a newspaper column, drag them down by the feet,
      and take their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Napoleon did wisely when he muzzled the press. I would wager that the
      Opposition papers would batter down a government of their own setting up,
      just as they are battering the present government, if any demand was
      refused. The more they have, the more they will want in the way of
      concessions. The <i>parvenu</i> journalist will be succeeded by the
      starveling hack. There is no salve for this sore. It is a kind of
      corruption which grows more and more obtrusive and malignant; the wider it
      spreads, the more patiently it will be endured, until the day comes when
      newspapers shall so increase and multiply in the earth that confusion will
      be the result&mdash;a second Babel. We, all of us, such as we are, have
      reason to know that crowned kings are less ungrateful than kings of our
      profession; that the most sordid man of business is not so mercenary nor
      so keen in speculation; that our brains are consumed to furnish their
      daily supply of poisonous trash. And yet we, all of us, shall continue to
      write, like men who work in quicksilver mines, knowing that they are
      doomed to die of their trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;at that young man sitting beside Coralie&mdash;what
      is his name? Lucien! He has a beautiful face; he is a poet; and what is
      more, he is witty&mdash;so much the better for him. Well, he will cross
      the threshold of one of those dens where a man&rsquo;s intellect is prostituted;
      he will put all his best and finest thought into his work; he will blunt
      his intellect and sully his soul; he will be guilty of anonymous
      meannesses which take the place of stratagem, pillage, and ratting to the
      enemy in the warfare of <i>condottieri</i>. And when, like hundreds more,
      he has squandered his genius in the service of others who find the capital
      and do no work, those dealers in poisons will leave him to starve if he is
      thirsty, and to die of thirst if he is starving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear me,&rdquo; continued Claude Vignon, &ldquo;<i>I</i> knew all this, yet here
      am I in the galleys, and the arrival of another convict gives me pleasure.
      We are cleverer, Blondet and I, than Messieurs This and That, who
      speculate in our abilities, yet nevertheless we are always exploited by
      them. We have a heart somewhere beneath the intellect; we have NOT the
      grim qualities of the man who makes others work for him. We are indolent,
      we like to look on at the game, we are meditative, and we are fastidious;
      they will sweat our brains and blame us for improvidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would be more amusing than this!&rdquo; said Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine is right,&rdquo; said Blondet; &ldquo;let us leave the cure of public evils
      to those quacks the statesmen. As Charlet says, &lsquo;Quarrel with my own bread
      and butter? <i>Never</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what Vignon puts me in mind of?&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Of one of
      those fat women in the Rue du Pelican telling a schoolboy, &lsquo;My boy, you
      are too young to come here.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burst of laughter followed the sally, but it pleased Coralie. The
      merchants meanwhile ate and drank and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nation this is! You see so much good in it and so much evil,&rdquo; said
      the Minister, addressing the Duc de Rhetore.&mdash;&ldquo;You are prodigals who
      cannot ruin yourselves, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, by the blessing of chance, Lucien, standing on the brink of the
      precipice over which he was destined to fall, heard warnings on all sides.
      D&rsquo;Arthez had set him on the right road, had shown him the noble method of
      work, and aroused in him the spirit before which all obstacles disappear.
      Lousteau himself (partly from selfish motives) had tried to warn him away
      by describing Journalism and Literature in their practical aspects. Lucien
      had refused to believe that there could be so much hidden corruption; but
      now he had heard the journalists themselves crying woe for their hurt, he
      had seen them at their work, had watched them tearing their
      foster-mother&rsquo;s heart to read auguries of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening he had seen things as they are. He beheld the very heart&rsquo;s
      core of corruption of that Paris which Blucher so aptly described; and so
      far from shuddering at the sight, he was intoxicated with enjoyment of the
      intellectually stimulating society in which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      These extraordinary men, clad in armor damascened by their vices, these
      intellects environed by cold and brilliant analysis, seemed so far greater
      in his eyes than the grave and earnest members of the brotherhood. And
      besides all this, he was reveling in his first taste of luxury; he had
      fallen under the spell. His capricious instincts awoke; for the first time
      in his life he drank exquisite wines, this was his first experience of
      cookery carried to the pitch of a fine art. A minister, a duke, and an
      opera-dancer had joined the party of journalists, and wondered at their
      sinister power. Lucien felt a horrible craving to reign over these kings,
      and he thought that he had power to win his kingdom. Finally, there was
      this Coralie, made happy by a few words of his. By the bright light of the
      wax-candles, through the steam of the dishes and the fumes of wine, she
      looked sublimely beautiful to his eyes, so fair had she grown with love.
      She was the loveliest, the most beautiful actress in Paris. The
      brotherhood, the heaven of noble thoughts, faded away before a temptation
      that appealed to every fibre of his nature. How could it have been
      otherwise? Lucien&rsquo;s author&rsquo;s vanity had just been gratified by the praises
      of those who know; by the appreciation of his future rivals; the success
      of his articles and his conquest of Coralie might have turned an older
      head than his.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the discussion, moreover, every one at table had made a remarkably
      good supper, and such wines are not met with every day. Lousteau, sitting
      beside Camusot, furtively poured cherry-brandy several times into his
      neighbor&rsquo;s wineglass, and challenged him to drink. And Camusot drank, all
      unsuspicious, for he thought himself, in his own way, a match for a
      journalist. The jokes became more personal when dessert appeared and the
      wine began to circulate. The German Minister, a keen-witted man of the
      world, made a sign to the Duke and Tullia, and the three disappeared with
      the first symptoms of vociferous nonsense which precede the grotesque
      scenes of an orgy in its final stage. Coralie and Lucien had been behaving
      like children all the evening; as soon as the wine was uppermost in
      Camusot&rsquo;s head, they made good their escape down the staircase and sprang
      into a cab. Camusot subsided under the table; Matifat, looking round for
      him, thought that he had gone home with Coralie, left his guests to smoke,
      laugh, and argue, and followed Florine to her room. Daylight surprised the
      party, or more accurately, the first dawn of light discovered one man
      still able to speak, and Blondet, that intrepid champion, was proposing to
      the assembled sleepers a health to Aurora the rosy-fingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was unaccustomed to orgies of this kind. His head was very
      tolerably clear as he came down the staircase, but the fresh air was too
      much for him; he was horribly drunk. When they reached the handsome house
      in the Rue de Vendome, where the actress lived, Coralie and her
      waiting-woman were obliged to assist the poet to climb to the first floor.
      Lucien was ignominiously sick, and very nearly fainted on the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Berenice, some tea! Make some tea,&rdquo; cried Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing; it is the air,&rdquo; Lucien got out, &ldquo;and I have never taken so
      much before in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! He is as innocent as a lamb,&rdquo; said Berenice, a stalwart Norman
      peasant woman as ugly as Coralie was pretty. Lucien, half unconscious, was
      laid at last in bed. Coralie, with Berenice&rsquo;s assistance, undressed the
      poet with all a mother&rsquo;s tender care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he murmured again and again. &ldquo;It is the air. Thank you,
      mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How charmingly he says &lsquo;mamma,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Coralie, putting a kiss on his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happiness to love such an angel, mademoiselle! Where did you pick
      him up? I did not think a man could be as beautiful as you are,&rdquo; said
      Berenice, when Lucien lay in bed. He was very drowsy; he knew nothing and
      saw nothing; Coralie made him swallow several cups of tea, and left him to
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the porter see us? Was there anyone else about?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was sitting up for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Victoire know anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather not!&rdquo; returned Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten hours later Lucien awoke to meet Coralie&rsquo;s eyes. She had watched by
      him as he slept; he knew it, poet that he was. It was almost noon, but she
      still wore the delicate dress, abominably stained, which she meant to lay
      up as a relic. Lucien understood all the self-sacrifice and delicacy of
      love, fain of its reward. He looked into Coralie&rsquo;s eyes. In a moment she
      had flung off her clothing and slipped like a serpent to Lucien&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Lucien was still sleeping, cradled in
      this voluptuous paradise. He had caught glimpses of Coralie&rsquo;s chamber, an
      exquisite creation of luxury, a world of rose-color and white. He had
      admired Florine&rsquo;s apartments, but this surpassed them in its dainty
      refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie had already risen; for if she was to play her part as the
      Andalusian, she must be at the theatre by seven o&rsquo;clock. Yet she had
      returned to gaze at the unconscious poet, lulled to sleep in bliss; she
      could not drink too deeply of this love that rose to rapture, drawing
      close the bond between the heart and the senses, to steep both in ecstasy.
      For in that apotheosis of human passion, which of those that were twain on
      earth that they might know bliss to the full creates one soul to rise to
      love in heaven, lay Coralie&rsquo;s justification. Who, moreover, would not have
      found excuse in Lucien&rsquo;s more than human beauty? To the actress kneeling
      by the bedside, happy in love within her, it seemed that she had received
      love&rsquo;s consecration. Berenice broke in upon Coralie&rsquo;s rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Camusot!&rdquo; cried the maid. &ldquo;And he knows that you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien sprang up at once. Innate generosity suggested that he was doing
      Coralie an injury. Berenice drew aside a curtain, and he fled into a
      dainty dressing-room, whither Coralie and the maid brought his clothes
      with magical speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camusot appeared, and only then did Coralie&rsquo;s eyes alight on Lucien&rsquo;s
      boots, warming in the fender. Berenice had privately varnished them, and
      put them before the fire to dry; and both mistress and maid alike forgot
      that tell-tale witness. Berenice left the room with a scared glance at
      Coralie. Coralie flung herself into the depths of a settee, and bade
      Camusot seat himself in the <i>gondole</i>, a round-backed chair that
      stood opposite. But Coralie&rsquo;s adorer, honest soul, dared not look his
      mistress in the face; he could not take his eyes off the pair of boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought I to make a scene and leave Coralie?&rdquo; he pondered. &ldquo;Is it worth
      while to make a fuss about a trifle? There is a pair of boots wherever you
      go. These would be more in place in a shop window or taking a walk on the
      boulevard on somebody&rsquo;s feet; here, however, without a pair of feet in
      them, they tell a pretty plain tale. I am fifty years old, and that is the
      truth; I ought to be as blind as Cupid himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no excuse for this mean-spirited monologue. The boots were not
      the high-lows at present in vogue, which an unobservant man may be allowed
      to disregard up to a certain point. They were the unmistakable,
      uncompromising hessians then prescribed by fashion, a pair of extremely
      elegant betasseled boots, which shone in glistening contrast against
      tight-fitting trousers invariably of some light color, and reflected their
      surroundings like a mirror. The boots stared the honest silk-mercer out of
      countenance, and, it must be added, they pained his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring the bell,&rdquo; said Coralie, smiling to herself at Camusot&rsquo;s want of
      spirit.&mdash;&ldquo;Berenice,&rdquo; she said, when the Norman handmaid appeared,
      &ldquo;just bring me a button-hook, for I must put on these confounded boots
      again. Don&rsquo;t forget to bring them to my dressing-room to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?... <i>your</i> boots?&rdquo;... faltered out Camusot, breathing more
      freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whose should they be?&rdquo; she demanded haughtily. &ldquo;Were you beginning to
      believe?&mdash;great stupid! Oh! and he would believe it too,&rdquo; she went
      on, addressing Berenice.&mdash;&ldquo;I have a man&rsquo;s part in What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s
      piece, and I have never worn a man&rsquo;s clothes in my life before. The
      bootmaker for the theatre brought me these things to try if I could walk
      in them, until a pair can be made to measure. He put them on, but they
      hurt me so much that I have taken them off, and after all I must wear
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put them on again if they are uncomfortable,&rdquo; said Camusot. (The
      boots had made him feel so very uncomfortable himself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle would do better to have a pair made of very thin morocco,
      sir, instead of torturing herself as she did just now; but the management
      is so stingy. She was crying, sir; if I was a man and loved a woman, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t let her shed a tear, I know. You ought to order a pair for her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Camusot. &ldquo;Are you just getting up, Coralie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this moment; I only came in at six o&rsquo;clock after looking for you
      everywhere. I was obliged to keep the cab for seven hours. So much for
      your care of me; you forget me for a wine-bottle. I ought to take care of
      myself now when I am to play every night so long as the <i>Alcalde</i>
      draws. I don&rsquo;t want to fall off after that young man&rsquo;s notice of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a handsome boy,&rdquo; said Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? I don&rsquo;t admire men of that sort; they are too much like
      women; and they do not understand how to love like you stupid old business
      men. You are so bored with your own society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is monsieur dining with madame?&rdquo; inquired Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my mouth is clammy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were nicely screwed yesterday. Ah! Papa Camusot, I don&rsquo;t like men who
      drink, I tell you at once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will give that young man a present, I suppose?&rdquo; interrupted Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. I would rather do that than pay as Florine does. There, go away
      with you, good-for-nothing that one loves; or give me a carriage to save
      time in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall go in your own carriage to-morrow to your manager&rsquo;s dinner at
      the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i>. The new piece will not be given next
      Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I am just going to dine,&rdquo; said Coralie, hurrying Camusot out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Berenice came to release Lucien. Berenice, Coralie&rsquo;s
      companion since her childhood, had a keen and subtle brain in her unwieldy
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Coralie is coming back alone; she even talked of
      getting rid of Camusot if he is in your way; but you are too much of an
      angel to ruin her, her heart&rsquo;s darling as you are. She wants to clear out
      of this, she says; to leave this paradise and go and live in your garret.
      Oh! there are those that are jealous and envious of you, and they have
      told her that you haven&rsquo;t a brass farthing, and live in the Latin Quarter;
      and I should go, too, you see, to do the house-work.&mdash;But I have just
      been comforting her, poor child! I have been telling her that you were too
      clever to do anything so silly. I was right, wasn&rsquo;t I, sir? Oh! you will
      see that you are her darling, her love, the god to whom she gives her
      soul; yonder old fool has nothing but the body.&mdash;If you only knew how
      nice she is when I hear her say her part over! My Coralie, my little pet,
      she is! She deserved that God in heaven should send her one of His angels.
      She was sick of the life.&mdash;She was so unhappy with her mother that
      used to beat her, and sold her. Yes, sir, sold her own child! If I had a
      daughter, I would wait on her hand and foot as I wait on Coralie; she is
      like my own child to me.&mdash;These are the first good times she has seen
      since I have been with her; the first time that she has been really
      applauded. You have written something, it seems, and they have got up a
      famous <i>claque</i> for the second performance. Braulard has been going
      through the play with her while you were asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Braulard?&rdquo; asked Lucien; it seemed to him that he had heard the name
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the head of the <i>claqueurs</i>, and she was arranging with him
      the places where she wished him to look after her. Florine might try to
      play her some shabby trick, and take all for herself, for all she calls
      herself her friend. There is such a talk about your article on the
      Boulevards.&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t it a bed fit for a prince,&rdquo; she said, smoothing
      the lace bed-spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lighted the wax-candles, and to Lucien&rsquo;s bewildered fancy, the house
      seemed to be some palace in the <i>Cabinet des Fees</i>. Camusot had
      chosen the richest stuffs from the <i>Golden Cocoon</i> for the hangings
      and window-curtains. A carpet fit for a king&rsquo;s palace was spread upon the
      floor. The carving of the rosewood furniture caught and imprisoned the
      light that rippled over its surface. Priceless trifles gleamed from the
      white marble chimney-piece. The rug beside the bed was of swan&rsquo;s skins
      bordered with sable. A pair of little, black velvet slippers lined with
      purple silk told of happiness awaiting the poet of <i>The Marguerites</i>.
      A dainty lamp hung from the ceiling draped with silk. The room was full of
      flowering plants, delicate white heaths and scentless camellias, in stands
      marvelously wrought. Everything called up associations of innocence. How
      was it possible in these rooms to see the life that Coralie led in its
      true colors? Berenice noticed Lucien&rsquo;s bewildered expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo; she said coaxingly. &ldquo;You would be more comfortable here,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you, than in a garret?&mdash;You won&rsquo;t let her do anything rash?&rdquo;
       she continued, setting a costly stand before him, covered with dishes
      abstracted from her mistress&rsquo; dinner-table, lest the cook should suspect
      that her mistress had a lover in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien made a good dinner. Berenice waiting on him, the dishes were of
      wrought silver, the painted porcelain plates had cost a louis d&rsquo;or apiece.
      The luxury was producing exactly the same effect upon him that the sight
      of a girl walking the pavement, with her bare flaunting throat and neat
      ankles, produces upon a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lucky Camusot is!&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky?&rdquo; repeated Berenice. &ldquo;He would willingly give all that he is worth
      to be in your place; he would be glad to barter his gray hair for your
      golden head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave Lucien the richest wine that Bordeaux keeps for the wealthiest
      English purchaser, and persuaded Lucien to go to bed to take a preliminary
      nap; and Lucien, in truth, was quite willing to sleep on the couch that he
      had been admiring. Berenice had read his wish, and felt glad for her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past ten that night Lucien awoke to look into eyes brimming over
      with love. There stood Coralie in most luxurious night attire. Lucien had
      been sleeping; Lucien was intoxicated with love, and not with wine.
      Berenice left the room with the inquiry, &ldquo;What time to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock. We will have breakfast in bed. I am not at home to
      anybody before two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Coralie and her lover were sitting
      together. The poet to all appearance had come to pay a call. Lucien had
      been bathed and combed and dressed. Coralie had sent to Colliau&rsquo;s for a
      dozen fine shirts, a dozen cravats and a dozen pocket-handkerchiefs for
      him, as well as twelve pairs of gloves in a cedar-wood box. When a
      carriage stopped at the door, they both rushed to the window, and watched
      Camusot alight from a handsome coupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have believed that one could so hate a man and luxury&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too poor to allow you to ruin yourself for me,&rdquo; he replied. And thus
      Lucien passed under the Caudine Forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor pet,&rdquo; said Coralie, holding him tightly to her, &ldquo;do you love me so
      much?&mdash;I persuaded this gentleman to call on me this morning,&rdquo; she
      continued, indicating Lucien to Camusot, who entered the room. &ldquo;I thought
      that we might take a drive in the Champs Elysees to try the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go without me,&rdquo; said Camusot in a melancholy voice; &ldquo;I shall not dine
      with you. It is my wife&rsquo;s birthday, I had forgotten that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Musot, how badly bored you will be!&rdquo; she said, putting her arms
      about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wild with joy at the thought that she and Lucien would handsel
      this gift together; she would drive with him in the new carriage; and in
      her happiness, she seemed to love Camusot, she lavished caresses upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only I could give you a carriage every day!&rdquo; said the poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, it is two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said, turning to Lucien, who stood in
      distress and confusion, but she comforted him with an adorable gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the stairs she went, several steps at a time, drawing Lucien after
      her; the elderly merchant following in their wake like a seal on land, and
      quite unable to catch them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien enjoyed the most intoxicating of pleasures; happiness had increased
      Coralie&rsquo;s loveliness to the highest possible degree; she appeared before
      all eyes an exquisite vision in her dainty toilette. All Paris in the
      Champs Elysees beheld the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an avenue of the Bois de Boulogne they met a caleche; Mme. d&rsquo;Espard and
      Mme. de Bargeton looked in surprise at Lucien, and met a scornful glance
      from the poet. He saw glimpses of a great future before him, and was about
      to make his power felt. He could fling them back in a glance some of the
      revengeful thoughts which had gnawed his heart ever since they planted
      them there. That moment was one of the sweetest in his life, and perhaps
      decided his fate. Once again the Furies seized on Lucien at the bidding of
      Pride. He would reappear in the world of Paris; he would take a signal
      revenge; all the social pettiness hitherto trodden under foot by the
      worker, the member of the brotherhood, sprang up again afresh in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he understood all that Lousteau&rsquo;s attack had meant. Lousteau had
      served his passions; while the brotherhood, that collective mentor, had
      seemed to mortify them in the interests of tiresome virtues and work which
      began to look useless and hopeless in Lucien&rsquo;s eyes. Work! What is it but
      death to an eager pleasure-loving nature? And how easy it is for the man
      of letters to slide into a <i>far niente</i> existence of self-indulgence,
      into the luxurious ways of actresses and women of easy virtues! Lucien
      felt an overmastering desire to continue the reckless life of the last two
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner at the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i> was exquisite. All Florine&rsquo;s
      supper guests were there except the Minister, the Duke, and the dancer;
      Camusot, too, was absent; but these gaps were filled by two famous actors
      and Hector Merlin and his mistress. This charming woman, who chose to be
      known as Mme. du Val-Noble, was the handsomest and most fashionable of the
      class of women now euphemistically styled <i>lorettes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had spent the forty-eight hours since the success of his article in
      paradise. He was feted and envied; he gained self-possession; his talk
      sparkled; he was the brilliant Lucien de Rubempre who shone for a few
      months in the world of letters and art. Finot, with his infallible
      instinct for discovering ability, scenting it afar as an ogre might scent
      human flesh, cajoled Lucien, and did his best to secure a recruit for the
      squadron under his command. And Coralie watched the manoeuvres of this
      purveyor of brains, saw that Lucien was nibbling at the bait, and tried to
      put him on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any engagement, dear boy; wait. They want to exploit you; we
      will talk of it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;I am sure I am quite as sharp and shrewd as they
      can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finot and Hector Merlin evidently had not fallen out over that affair of
      the white lines and spaces in the columns, for it was Finot who introduced
      Lucien to the journalist. Coralie and Mme. du Val-Noble were
      overwhelmingly amiable and polite to each other, and Mme. du Val-Noble
      asked Lucien and Coralie to dine with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector Merlin, short and thin, with lips always tightly compressed, was
      the most dangerous journalist present. Unbounded ambition and jealousy
      smouldered within him; he took pleasure in the pain of others, and
      fomented strife to turn it to his own account. His abilities were but
      slender, and he had little force of character, but the natural instinct
      which draws the upstart towards money and power served him as well as
      fixity of purpose. Lucien and Merlin at once took a dislike to one
      another, for reasons not far to seek. Merlin, unfortunately, proclaimed
      aloud the thoughts that Lucien kept to himself. By the time the dessert
      was put on the table, the most touching friendship appeared to prevail
      among the men, each one of whom in his heart thought himself a cleverer
      fellow than the rest; and Lucien as the newcomer was made much of by them
      all. They chatted frankly and unrestrainedly. Hector Merlin, alone, did
      not join in the laughter. Lucien asked the reason of his reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just entering the world of letters, I can see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
      a journalist with all your illusions left. You believe in friendship. Here
      we are friends or foes, as it happens; we strike down a friend with the
      weapon which by rights should only be turned against an enemy. You will
      find out, before very long, that fine sentiments will do nothing for you.
      If you are naturally kindly, learn to be ill-natured, to be consistently
      spiteful. If you have never heard this golden rule before, I give it you
      now in confidence, and it is no small secret. If you have a mind to be
      loved, never leave your mistress until you have made her shed a tear or
      two; and if you mean to make your way in literature, let other people
      continually feel your teeth; make no exception even of your friends; wound
      their susceptibilities, and everybody will fawn upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hector Merlin watched Lucien as he spoke, saw that his words went to the
      neophyte&rsquo;s heart like a stab, and Hector Merlin was glad. Play followed,
      Lucien lost all his money, and Coralie brought him away; and he forgot for
      a while, in the delights of love, the fierce excitement of the gambler,
      which was to gain so strong a hold upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left Coralie in the morning and returned to the Latin Quarter, he
      took out his purse and found the money he had lost. At first he felt
      miserable over the discovery, and thought of going back at once to return
      a gift which humiliated him; but&mdash;he had already come as far as the
      Rue de la Harpe; he would not return now that he had almost reached the
      Hotel de Cluny. He pondered over Coralie&rsquo;s forethought as he went, till he
      saw in it a proof of the maternal love which is blended with passion in
      women of her stamp. For Coralie and her like, passion includes every human
      affection. Lucien went from thought to thought, and argued himself into
      accepting the gift. &ldquo;I love her,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we shall live together as
      husband and wife; I will never forsake her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What mortal, short of a Diogenes, could fail to understand Lucien&rsquo;s
      feelings as he climbed the dirty, fetid staircase to his lodging, turned
      the key that grated in the lock, and entered and looked round at the
      unswept brick floor, at the cheerless grate, at the ugly poverty and
      bareness of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A package of manuscript was lying on the table. It was his novel; a note
      from Daniel d&rsquo;Arthez lay beside it:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Our friends are almost satisfied with your work, dear poet,&rdquo;
   d&rsquo;Arthez wrote. &ldquo;You will be able to present it with more
  confidence now, they say, to friends and enemies. We saw your
  charming article on the Panorama-Dramatique; you are sure to
  excite as much jealousy in the profession as regret among your
  friends here.                                 DANIEL.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regrets! What does he mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien. The polite tone of the
      note astonished him. Was he to be henceforth a stranger to the
      brotherhood? He had learned to set a higher value on the good opinion and
      the friendship of the circle in the Rue des Quatre-Vents since he had
      tasted of the delicious fruits offered to him by the Eve of the theatrical
      underworld. For some moments he stood in deep thought; he saw his present
      in the garret, and foresaw his future in Coralie&rsquo;s rooms. Honorable
      resolution struggled with temptation and swayed him now this way, now
      that. He sat down and began to look through his manuscript, to see in what
      condition his friends had returned it to him. What was his amazement, as
      he read chapter after chapter, to find his poverty transmuted into riches
      by the cunning of the pen, and the devotion of the unknown great men, his
      friends of the brotherhood. Dialogue, closely packed, nervous, pregnant,
      terse, and full of the spirit of the age, replaced his conversations,
      which seemed poor and pointless prattle in comparison. His characters, a
      little uncertain in the drawing, now stood out in vigorous contrast of
      color and relief; physiological observations, due no doubt to Horace
      Bianchon, supplied links of interpretations between human character and
      the curious phenomena of human life&mdash;subtle touches which made his
      men and women live. His wordy passages of description were condensed and
      vivid. The misshapen, ill-clad child of his brain had returned to him as a
      lovely maiden, with white robes and rosy-hued girdle and scarf&mdash;an
      entrancing creation. Night fell and took him by surprise, reading through
      rising tears, stricken to earth by such greatness of soul, feeling the
      worth of such a lesson, admiring the alterations, which taught him more of
      literature and art than all his four years&rsquo; apprenticeship of study and
      reading and comparison. A master&rsquo;s correction of a line made upon the
      study always teaches more than all the theories and criticisms in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friends are these! What hearts! How fortunate I am!&rdquo; he cried,
      grasping his manuscript tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the quick impulsiveness of a poetic and mobile temperament, he rushed
      off to Daniel&rsquo;s lodging. As he climbed the stairs, and thought of these
      friends, who refused to leave the path of honor, he felt conscious that he
      was less worthy of them than before. A voice spoke within him, telling him
      that if d&rsquo;Arthez had loved Coralie, he would have had her break with
      Camusot. And, besides this, he knew that the brotherhood held journalism
      in utter abhorrence, and that he himself was already, to some small
      extent, a journalist. All of them, except Meyraux, who had just gone out,
      were in d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s room when he entered it, and saw that all their faces
      were full of sorrow and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just heard news of a dreadful catastrophe; the greatest thinker
      of the age, our most loved friend, who was like a light among us for two
      years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Lambert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has fallen a victim to catalepsy. There is no hope for him,&rdquo; said
      Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will die, his soul wandering in the skies, his body unconscious on
      earth,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will die as he lived,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love fell like a firebrand in the vast empire of his brain and burned him
      away,&rdquo; said Leon Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joseph Bridau, &ldquo;he has reached a height that we cannot so much
      as see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i> are to be pitied, not Louis,&rdquo; said Fulgence Ridal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will recover,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what Meyraux has been telling us, recovery seems impossible,&rdquo;
       answered Bianchon. &ldquo;Medicine has no power over the change that is working
      in his brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there are physical means,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bianchon; &ldquo;we might produce imbecility instead of catalepsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no way of offering another head to the spirit of evil? I would
      give mine to save him!&rdquo; cried Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would become of European federation?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! true,&rdquo; replied Michel Chrestien. &ldquo;Our duty to Humanity comes first;
      to one man afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here with a heart full of gratitude to you all,&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;You
      have changed my alloy into golden coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude! For what do you take us?&rdquo; asked Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had the pleasure,&rdquo; added Fulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so you are a journalist, are you?&rdquo; asked Leon Giraud. &ldquo;The fame of
      your first appearance has reached even the Latin Quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a journalist yet,&rdquo; returned Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! So much the better,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez. &ldquo;Lucien knows the value of a clean
      conscience. When you can say to yourself as you lay your head on the
      pillow at night, &lsquo;I have not sat in judgment on another man&rsquo;s work; I have
      given pain to no one; I have not used the edge of my wit to deal a stab to
      some harmless soul; I have sacrificed no one&rsquo;s success to a jest; I have
      not even troubled the happiness of imbecility; I have not added to the
      burdens of genius; I have scorned the easy triumphs of epigram; in short,
      I have not acted against my convictions,&rsquo; is not this a viaticum that
      gives one daily strength?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one can say all this, surely, and yet work on a newspaper,&rdquo; said
      Lucien. &ldquo;If I had absolutely no other way of earning a living, I should
      certainly come to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; cried Fulgence, his voice rising a note each time; &ldquo;we are
      capitulating, are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will turn journalist,&rdquo; Leon Giraud said gravely. &ldquo;Oh, Lucien, if you
      would only stay and work with us! We are about to bring out a periodical
      in which justice and truth shall never be violated; we will spread
      doctrines that, perhaps, will be of real service to mankind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not have a single subscriber,&rdquo; Lucien broke in with
      Machiavellian wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be five hundred of them,&rdquo; asserted Michel Chrestien, &ldquo;but they
      will be worth five hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will need a lot of capital,&rdquo; continued Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only devotion,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody might take him for a perfumer&rsquo;s assistant,&rdquo; burst out Michel
      Chrestien, looking at Lucien&rsquo;s head, and sniffing comically. &ldquo;You were
      seen driving about in a very smart turnout with a pair of thoroughbreds,
      and a mistress for a prince, Coralie herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and is there any harm in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not say that if you thought that there was no harm in it,&rdquo; said
      Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have wished Lucien a Beatrice,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez, &ldquo;a noble woman,
      who would have been a help to him in life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Daniel,&rdquo; asked Lucien, &ldquo;love is love wherever you find it, is it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the republican member, &ldquo;on that one point I am an aristocrat. I
      could not bring myself to love a woman who must rub shoulders with all
      sorts of people in the green-room; whom an actor kisses on stage; she must
      lower herself before the public, smile on every one, lift her skirts as
      she dances, and dress like a man, that all the world may see what none
      should see save I alone. Or if I loved such a woman, she should leave the
      stage, and my love should cleanse her from the stain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if she would not leave the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should die of mortification, jealousy, and all sorts of pain. You
      cannot pluck love out of your heart as you draw a tooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s face grew dark and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they find out that I am tolerating Camusot, how they will despise
      me,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the fierce republican, with humorous fierceness, &ldquo;you
      can be a great writer, but a little play-actor you shall never be,&rdquo; and he
      took up his hat and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is hard, is Michel Chrestien,&rdquo; commented Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard and salutary, like the dentist&rsquo;s pincers,&rdquo; said Bianchon. &ldquo;Michel
      foresees your future; perhaps in the street, at this moment, he is
      thinking of you with tears in his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Arthez was kind, and talked comfortingly, and tried to cheer Lucien. The
      poet spent an hour with his friends, then he went, but his conscience
      treated him hardly, crying to him, &ldquo;You will be a journalist&mdash;a
      journalist!&rdquo; as the witch cried to Macbeth that he should be king
      hereafter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the street, he looked up at d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s windows, and saw a faint
      light shining in them, and his heart sank. A dim foreboding told him that
      he had bidden his friends good-bye for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned out of the Place de la Sorbonne into the Rue de Cluny, he saw
      a carriage at the door of his lodging. Coralie had driven all the way from
      the Boulevard du Temple for the sake of a moment with her lover and a
      &ldquo;good-night.&rdquo; Lucien found her sobbing in his garret. She would be as
      wretchedly poor as her poet, she wept, as she arranged his shirts and
      gloves and handkerchiefs in the crazy chest of drawers. Her distress was
      so real and so great, that Lucien, but even now chidden for his connection
      with an actress, saw Coralie as a saint ready to assume the hair-shirt of
      poverty. The adorable girl&rsquo;s excuse for her visit was an announcement that
      the firm of Camusot, Coralie, and Lucien meant to invite Matifat, Florine,
      and Lousteau (the second trio) to supper; had Lucien any invitations to
      issue to people who might be useful to him? Lucien said that he would take
      counsel of Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments were spent together, and Coralie hurried away. She spared
      Lucien the knowledge that Camusot was waiting for her below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, Lucien went to Etienne Lousteau&rsquo;s room,
      found it empty, and hurried away to Florine. Lousteau and Florine, settled
      into possession of their new quarters like a married couple, received
      their friend in the pretty bedroom, and all three breakfasted sumptuously
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I should advise you, my boy, to come with me to see Felicien
      Vernou,&rdquo; said Lousteau, when they sat at table, and Lucien had mentioned
      Coralie&rsquo;s projected supper; &ldquo;ask him to be of the party, and keep well
      with him, if you can keep well with such a rascal. Felicien Vernou does a
      <i>feuilleton</i> for a political paper; he might perhaps introduce you,
      and you could blossom out into leaders in it at your ease. It is a Liberal
      paper, like ours; you will be a Liberal, that is the popular party; and
      besides, if you mean to go over to the Ministerialists, you would do
      better for yourself if they had reason to be afraid of you. Then there is
      Hector Merlin and his Mme. du Val-Noble; you meet great people at their
      house&mdash;dukes and dandies and millionaires; didn&rsquo;t they ask you and
      Coralie to dine with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lucien; &ldquo;you are going too, and so is Florine.&rdquo; Lucien and
      Etienne were now on familiar terms after Friday&rsquo;s debauch and the dinner
      at the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Merlin is on the paper; we shall come across him pretty often;
      he is the chap to follow close on Finot&rsquo;s heels. You would do well to pay
      him attention; ask him and Mme. du Val-Noble to supper. He may be useful
      to you before long; for rancorous people are always in need of others, and
      he may do you a good turn if he can reckon on your pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your beginning has made enough sensation to smooth your way,&rdquo; said
      Florine; &ldquo;take advantage of it at once, or you will soon be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bargain, the great business, is concluded,&rdquo; Lousteau continued. &ldquo;That
      Finot, without a spark of talent in him, is to be editor of Dauriat&rsquo;s
      weekly paper, with a salary of six hundred francs per month, and owner of
      a sixth share, for which he has not paid one penny. And I, my dear fellow,
      am now editor of our little paper. Everything went off as I expected;
      Florine managed superbly, she could give points to Tallyrand himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a hold on men through their pleasures,&rdquo; said Florine, &ldquo;while a
      diplomatist only works on their self-love. A diplomatist sees a man made
      up for the occasion; we know him in his moments of folly, so our power is
      greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when the thing was settled, Matifat made the first and last joke of
      his whole druggist&rsquo;s career,&rdquo; put in Lousteau. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;This affair is
      quite in my line; I am supplying drugs to the public.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect that Florine put him up to it,&rdquo; cried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by these means, my little dear, your foot is in the stirrup,&rdquo;
       continued Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth,&rdquo; remarked Florine. &ldquo;What
      lots of young fellows wait for years, wait till they are sick of waiting,
      for a chance to get an article into a paper! You will do like Emile
      Blondet. In six months&rsquo; time you will be giving yourself high and mighty
      airs,&rdquo; she added, with a mocking smile, in the language of her class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been in Paris for three years?&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;and only
      yesterday Finot began to pay me a fixed monthly salary of three hundred
      francs, and a hundred francs per sheet for his paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; you are saying nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Florine, with her eyes turned on
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, if you had been my brother, I could not have done more for
      you,&rdquo; retorted Lousteau, somewhat nettled, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t answer for Finot.
      Scores of sharp fellows will besiege Finot for the next two days with
      offers to work for low pay. I have promised for you, but you can draw back
      if you like.&mdash;You little know how lucky you are,&rdquo; he added after a
      pause. &ldquo;All those in our set combine to attack an enemy in various papers,
      and lend each other a helping hand all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go in the first place to Felicien Vernou,&rdquo; said Lucien. He was
      eager to conclude an alliance with such formidable birds of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau sent for a cab, and the pair of friends drove to Vernou&rsquo;s house
      on the second floor up an alley in the Rue Mandar. To Lucien&rsquo;s great
      astonishment, the harsh, fastidious, and severe critic&rsquo;s surroundings were
      vulgar to the last degree. A marbled paper, cheap and shabby, with a
      meaningless pattern repeated at regular intervals, covered the walls, and
      a series of aqua tints in gilt frames decorated the apartment, where
      Vernou sat at table with a woman so plain that she could only be the
      legitimate mistress of the house, and two very small children perched on
      high chairs with a bar in front to prevent the infants from tumbling out.
      Felicien Vernou, in a cotton dressing-gown contrived out of the remains of
      one of his wife&rsquo;s dresses, was not over well pleased by this invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you breakfasted, Lousteau?&rdquo; he asked, placing a chair for Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just left Florine; we have been breakfasting with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien could not take his eyes off Mme. Vernou. She looked like a stout,
      homely cook, with a tolerably fair complexion, but commonplace to the last
      degree. The lady wore a bandana tied over her night-cap, the strings of
      the latter article of dress being tied so tightly under the chin that her
      puffy cheeks stood out on either side. A shapeless, beltless garment,
      fastened by a single button at the throat, enveloped her from head to foot
      in such a fashion that a comparison to a milestone at once suggested
      itself. Her health left no room for hope; her cheeks were almost purple;
      her fingers looked like sausages. In a moment it dawned upon Lucien how it
      was that Vernou was always so ill at ease in society; here was the living
      explanation of his misanthropy. Sick of his marriage, unable to bring
      himself to abandon his wife and family, he had yet sufficient of the
      artistic temper to suffer continually from their presence; Vernou was an
      actor by nature bound never to pardon the success of another, condemned to
      chronic discontent because he was never content with himself. Lucien began
      to understand the sour look which seemed to add to the bleak expression of
      envy on Vernou&rsquo;s face; the acerbity of the epigrams with which his
      conversation was sown, the journalist&rsquo;s pungent phrases, keen and
      elaborately wrought as a stiletto, were at once explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go into my study,&rdquo; Vernou said, rising from the table; &ldquo;you have
      come on business, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; replied Etienne Lousteau. &ldquo;It is a supper, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought a message from Coralie,&rdquo; said Lucien (Mme. Vernou looked
      up at once at the name), &ldquo;to ask you to supper to-night at her house to
      meet the same company as before at Florine&rsquo;s, and a few more besides&mdash;Hector
      Merlin and Mme. du Val-Noble and some others. There will be play
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are engaged to Mme. Mahoudeau this evening, dear,&rdquo; put in the
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo; returned Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will take offence if we don&rsquo;t go; and you are very glad of her when
      you have a bill to discount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This wife of mine, my dear boy, can never be made to understand that a
      supper engagement for twelve o&rsquo;clock does not prevent you from going to an
      evening party that comes to an end at eleven. She is always with me while
      I work,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have so much imagination!&rdquo; said Lucien, and thereby made a mortal
      enemy of Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Lousteau, &ldquo;you are coming; but that is not all. M. de
      Rubempre is about to be one of us, so you must push him in your paper.
      Give him out for a chap that will make a name for himself in literature,
      so that he can put in at least a couple of articles every month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he means to be one of us, and will attack our enemies, as we will
      attack his, I will say a word for him at the Opera to-night,&rdquo; replied
      Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;good-bye till to-morrow, my boy,&rdquo; said Lousteau, shaking
      hands with every sign of cordiality. &ldquo;When is your book coming out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on Dauriat; it is ready,&rdquo; said Vernou <i>pater-familias</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will get up a success,&rdquo; said Lousteau, and he rose with a bow to his
      colleague&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt departure was necessary indeed; for the two infants, engaged in
      a noisy quarrel, were fighting with their spoons, and flinging the pap in
      each other&rsquo;s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, my boy, is a woman who all unconsciously will work great havoc in
      contemporary literature,&rdquo; said Etienne, when they came away. &ldquo;Poor Vernou
      cannot forgive us for his wife. He ought to be relieved of her in the
      interests of the public; and a deluge of blood-thirsty reviews and
      stinging sarcasms against successful men of every sort would be averted.
      What is to become of a man with such a wife and that pair of abominable
      brats? Have you seen Rigaudin in Picard&rsquo;s <i>La Maison en Loterie</i>? You
      have? Well, like Rigaudin, Vernou will not fight himself, but he will set
      others fighting; he would give an eye to put out both eyes in the head of
      the best friend he has. You will see him using the bodies of the slain for
      a stepping-stone, rejoicing over every one&rsquo;s misfortunes, attacking
      princes, dukes, marquises, and nobles, because he himself is a commoner;
      reviling the work of unmarried men because he forsooth has a wife; and
      everlastingly preaching morality, the joys of domestic life, and the
      duties of the citizen. In short, this very moral critic will spare no one,
      not even infants of tender age. He lives in the Rue Mandar with a wife who
      might be the <i>Mamamouchi</i> of the <i>Bourgeois gentilhomme</i> and a
      couple of little Vernous as ugly as sin. He tries to sneer at the Faubourg
      Saint-Germain, where he will never set foot, and makes his duchesses talk
      like his wife. That is the sort of man to raise a howl at the Jesuits,
      insult the Court, and credit the Court party with the design of restoring
      feudal rights and the right of primogeniture&mdash;just the one to preach
      a crusade for Equality, he that thinks himself the equal of no one. If he
      were a bachelor, he would go into society; if he were in a fair way to be
      a Royalist poet with a pension and the Cross of the Legion of Honor, he
      would be an optimist, and journalism offers starting-points by the
      hundred. Journalism is the giant catapult set in motion by pigmy hatreds.
      Have you any wish to marry after this? Vernou has none of the milk of
      human kindness in him, it is all turned to gall; and he is emphatically
      the Journalist, a tiger with two hands that tears everything to pieces, as
      if his pen had the hydrophobia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a case of gunophobia,&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;Has he ability?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is witty, he is a writer of articles. He incubates articles; he does
      that all his life and nothing else. The most dogged industry would fail to
      graft a book on his prose. Felicien is incapable of conceiving a work on a
      large scale, of broad effects, of fitting characters harmoniously in a
      plot which develops till it reaches a climax. He has ideas, but he has no
      knowledge of facts; his heroes are utopian creatures, philosophical or
      Liberal notions masquerading. He is at pains to write an original style,
      but his inflated periods would collapse at a pin-prick from a critic; and
      therefore he goes in terror of reviews, like every one else who can only
      keep his head above water with the bladders of newspaper puffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an article you are making out of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That particular kind, my boy, must be spoken, and never written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are turning editor,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I put you down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Coralie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we are infatuated,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;What a mistake! Do as I do with
      Florine, let Coralie be your housekeeper, and take your fling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would send a saint to perdition,&rdquo; laughed Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is no damning a devil,&rdquo; retorted Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flippant tone, the brilliant talk of this new friend, his views of
      life, his paradoxes, the axioms of Parisian Machiavelism,&mdash;all these
      things impressed Lucien unawares. Theoretically the poet knew that such
      thoughts were perilous; but he believed them practically useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the Boulevard du Temple, the friends agreed to meet at the
      office between four and five o&rsquo;clock. Hector Merlin would doubtless be
      there. Lousteau was right. The infatuation of desire was upon Lucien; for
      the courtesan who loves knows how to grapple her lover to her by every
      weakness in his nature, fashioning herself with incredible flexibility to
      his every wish, encouraging the soft, effeminate habits which strengthen
      her hold. Lucien was thirsting already for enjoyment; he was in love with
      the easy, luxurious, and expensive life which the actress led.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Coralie and Camusot intoxicated with joy. The Gymnase offered
      Coralie an engagement after Easter on terms for which she had never dared
      to hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this great success is owing to you,&rdquo; said Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely. <i>The Alcalde</i> would have fallen flat but for him,&rdquo;
       cried Coralie; &ldquo;if there had been no article, I should have been in for
      another six years of the Boulevard theatres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She danced up to Lucien and flung her arms round him, putting an
      indescribable silken softness and sweetness into her enthusiasm. Love had
      come to Coralie. And Camusot? his eyes fell. Looking down after the wont
      of mankind in moments of sharp pain, he saw the seam of Lucien&rsquo;s boots, a
      deep yellow thread used by the best bootmakers of that time, in strong
      contrast with the glistening leather. The color of that seam had tinged
      his thoughts during a previous conversation with himself, as he sought to
      explain the presence of a mysterious pair of hessians in Coralie&rsquo;s fender.
      He remembered now that he had seen the name of &ldquo;Gay, Rue de la
      Michodiere,&rdquo; printed in black letters on the soft white kid lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a handsome pair of boots, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like everything else about him,&rdquo; said Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very glad of your bootmaker&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how like the Rue des Bourdonnais to ask for a tradesman&rsquo;s address,&rdquo;
       cried Coralie. &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> intend to patronize a young man&rsquo;s bootmaker?
      A nice young man you would make! Do keep to your own top-boots; they are
      the kind for a steady-going man with a wife and family and a mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, if you would take off one of your boots, sir, I should be very
      much obliged,&rdquo; persisted Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not get it on again without a button-hook,&rdquo; said Lucien, flushing
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berenice will fetch you one; we can do with some here,&rdquo; jeered Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa Camusot!&rdquo; said Coralie, looking at him with cruel scorn, &ldquo;have the
      courage of your pitiful baseness. Come, speak out! You think that this
      gentleman&rsquo;s boots are very like mine, do you not?&mdash;I forbid you to
      take off your boots,&rdquo; she added, turning to Lucien.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, M.
      Camusot. Yes, you saw some boots lying about in the fender here the other
      day, and that is the identical pair, and this gentleman was hiding in my
      dressing-room at the time, waiting for them; and he had passed the night
      here. That was what you were thinking, <i>hein</i>? Think so; I would
      rather you did. It is the simple truth. I am deceiving you. And if I am? I
      do it to please myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down. There was no anger in her face, no embarrassment; she looked
      from Camusot to Lucien. The two men avoided each other&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will believe nothing that you do not wish me to believe,&rdquo; said Camusot.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play with me, Coralie; I was wrong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am either a shameless baggage that has taken a sudden fancy; or a poor,
      unhappy girl who feels what love really is for the first time, the love
      that all women long for. And whichever way it is, you must leave me or
      take me as I am,&rdquo; she said, with a queenly gesture that crushed Camusot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really true?&rdquo; he asked, seeing from their faces that this was no
      jest, yet begging to be deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love mademoiselle,&rdquo; Lucien faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that word, Coralie sprang to her poet and held him tightly to her;
      then, with her arms still about him, she turned to the silk-mercer, as if
      to bid him see the beautiful picture made by two young lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Musot, take all that you gave to me back again; I do not want to
      keep anything of yours; for I love this boy here madly, not for his
      intellect, but for his beauty. I would rather starve with him than have
      millions with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camusot sank into a low chair, hid his face in his hands, and said not a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like us to go away?&rdquo; she asked. There was a note of ferocity in
      her voice which no words can describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold chills ran down Lucien&rsquo;s spine; he beheld himself burdened with a
      woman, an actress, and a household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here, Coralie; keep it all,&rdquo; the old tradesman said at last, in a
      faint, unsteady voice that came from his heart; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything
      back. There is the worth of sixty thousand francs here in the furniture;
      but I could not bear to think of my Coralie in want. And yet, it will not
      be long before you come to want. However great this gentleman&rsquo;s talent may
      be, he can&rsquo;t afford to keep you. We old fellows must expect this sort of
      thing. Coralie, let me come and see you sometimes; I may be of use to you.
      And&mdash;I confess it; I cannot live without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor man&rsquo;s gentleness, stripped as he was of his happiness just as
      happiness had reached its height, touched Lucien deeply. Coralie was quite
      unsoftened by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come as often as you wish, poor Musot,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I shall like you all
      the better when I don&rsquo;t pretend to love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camusot seemed to be resigned to his fate so long as he was not driven out
      of the earthly paradise, in which his life could not have been all joy; he
      trusted to the chances of life in Paris and to the temptations that would
      beset Lucien&rsquo;s path; he would wait a while, and all that had been his
      should be his again. Sooner or later, thought the wily tradesman, this
      handsome young fellow would be unfaithful; he would keep a watch on him;
      and the better to do this and use his opportunity with Coralie, he would
      be their friend. The persistent passion that could consent to such
      humiliation terrified Lucien. Camusot&rsquo;s proposal of a dinner at Very&rsquo;s in
      the Palais Royal was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What joy!&rdquo; cried Coralie, as soon as Camusot had departed. &ldquo;You will not
      go back now to your garret in the Latin Quarter; you will live here. We
      shall always be together. You can take a room in the Rue Charlot for the
      sake of appearances, and <i>vogue le galere</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to dance her Spanish dance, with an excited eagerness that
      revealed the strength of the passion in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I work hard I may make five hundred francs a month,&rdquo; Lucien said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall make as much again at the theatre, without counting extras.
      Camusot will pay for my dresses as before. He is fond of me! We can live
      like Croesus on fifteen hundred francs a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the horses? and the coachman? and the footman?&rdquo; inquired Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get into debt,&rdquo; said Coralie. And she began to dance with Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must close with Finot after this,&rdquo; Lucien exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Coralie, &ldquo;I will dress and take you to your office. I will
      wait outside in the boulevard for you with the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien sat down on the sofa and made some very sober reflections as he
      watched Coralie at her toilet. It would have been wiser to leave Coralie
      free than to start all at once with such an establishment; but Coralie was
      there before his eyes, and Coralie was so lovely, so graceful, so
      bewitching, that the more picturesque aspects of bohemia were in evidence;
      and he flung down the gauntlet to fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice was ordered to superintend Lucien&rsquo;s removal and installation; and
      Coralie, triumphant, radiant, and happy, carried off her love, her poet,
      and must needs go all over Paris on the way to the Rue Saint-Fiacre.
      Lucien sprang lightly up the staircase, and entered the office with an air
      of being quite at home. Coloquinte was there with the stamped paper still
      on his head; and old Giroudeau told him again, hypocritically enough, that
      no one had yet come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the editor and contributors <i>must</i> meet somewhere or other to
      arrange about the journal,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but I have nothing to do with the writing of the paper,&rdquo;
       said the Emperor&rsquo;s captain, resuming his occupation of checking off
      wrappers with his eternal broum! broum!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it lucky or unlucky? Finot chanced to come in at that very moment to
      announce his sham abdication and to bid Giroudeau watch over his
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No shilly-shally with this gentleman; he is on the staff,&rdquo; Finot added
      for his uncle&rsquo;s benefit, as he grasped Lucien by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is he on the paper?&rdquo; exclaimed Giroudeau, much surprised at this
      friendliness. &ldquo;Well, sir, you came on without much difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make things snug for you here, lest Etienne should bamboozle
      you,&rdquo; continued Finot, looking knowingly at Lucien. &ldquo;This gentleman will
      be paid three francs per column all round, including theatres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never taken any one on such terms before,&rdquo; said Giroudeau,
      opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will take the four Boulevard theatres. See that nobody sneaks his
      boxes, and that he gets his share of tickets.&mdash;I should advise you,
      nevertheless, to have them sent to your address,&rdquo; he added, turning to
      Lucien.&mdash;&ldquo;And he agrees to write besides ten miscellaneous articles
      of two columns each, for fifty francs per month, for one year. Does that
      suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucien. Circumstances had forced his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw up the agreement, uncle, and we will sign it when we come
      downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the gentleman?&rdquo; inquired Giroudeau, rising and taking off his
      black silk skull-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Lucien de Rubempre, who wrote the article on <i>The Alcalde</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, you have a gold mine <i>there</i>,&rdquo; said the old soldier,
      tapping Lucien on the forehead. &ldquo;I am not literary myself, but I read that
      article of yours, and I liked it. That is the kind of thing! There&rsquo;s
      gaiety for you! &lsquo;That will bring us new subscribers,&rsquo; says I to myself.
      And so it did. We sold fifty more numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my agreement with Lousteau made out in duplicate and ready to sign?&rdquo;
       asked Finot, speaking aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ante-date this gentleman&rsquo;s agreement by one day, so that Lousteau
      will be bound by the previous contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finot took his new contributor&rsquo;s arm with a friendliness that charmed
      Lucien, and drew him out on the landing to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your position is made for you. I will introduce you to <i>my</i> staff
      myself, and to-night Lousteau will go round with you to the theatres. You
      can make a hundred and fifty francs per month on this little paper of ours
      with Lousteau as its editor, so try to keep well with him. The rogue bears
      a grudge against me as it is, for tying his hands so far as you are
      concerned; but you have ability, and I don&rsquo;t choose that you shall be
      subjected to the whims of the editor. You might let me have a couple of
      sheets every month for my review, and I will pay you two hundred francs.
      This is between ourselves, don&rsquo;t mention it to anybody else; I should be
      laid open to the spite of every one whose vanity is mortified by your good
      fortune. Write four articles, fill your two sheets, sign two with your own
      name, and two with a pseudonym, so that you may not seem to be taking the
      bread out of anybody else&rsquo;s mouth. You owe your position to Blondet and
      Vignon; they think that you have a future before you. So keep out of
      scrapes, and, above all things, be on your guard against your friends. As
      for me, we shall always get on well together, you and I. Help me, and I
      will help you. You have forty francs&rsquo; worth of boxes and tickets to sell,
      and sixty francs&rsquo; worth of books to convert into cash. With that and your
      work on the paper, you will be making four hundred and fifty francs every
      month. If you use your wits, you will find ways of making another two
      hundred francs at least among the publishers; they will pay you for
      reviews and prospectuses. But you are mine, are you not? I can count upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien squeezed Finot&rsquo;s hand in transports of joy which no words can
      express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let any one see that anything has passed between us,&rdquo; said Finot in
      his ear, and he flung open a door of a room in the roof at the end of a
      long passage on the fifth floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A table covered with a green cloth was drawn up to a blazing fire, and
      seated in various chairs and lounges Lucien discovered Lousteau, Felicien
      Vernou, Hector Merlin, and two others unknown to him, all laughing or
      smoking. A real inkstand, full of ink this time, stood on the table among
      a great litter of papers; while a collection of pens, the worse for wear,
      but still serviceable for journalists, told the new contributor very
      plainly that the mighty enterprise was carried on in this apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Finot, &ldquo;the object of this gathering is the installation
      of our friend Lousteau in my place as editor of the newspaper which I am
      compelled to relinquish. But although my opinions will necessarily undergo
      a transformation when I accept the editorship of a review of which the
      politics are known to you, my <i>convictions</i> remain the same, and we
      shall be friends as before. I am quite at your service, and you likewise
      will be ready to do anything for me. Circumstances change; principles are
      fixed. Principles are the pivot on which the hands of the political
      barometer turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant shout of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who put that into your mouth?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondet!&rdquo; said Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Windy, showery, stormy, settled fair,&rdquo; said Merlin; &ldquo;we will all row in
      the same boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; continued Finot, &ldquo;not to muddle our wits with metaphors, any
      one who has an article or two for me will always find Finot.&mdash;This
      gentleman,&rdquo; turning to Lucien, &ldquo;will be one of you.&mdash;I have arranged
      with him, Lousteau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one congratulated Finot on his advance and new prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there you are, mounted on our shoulders,&rdquo; said a contributor whom
      Lucien did not know. &ldquo;You will be the Janus of Journal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as he isn&rsquo;t the Janot,&rdquo; put in Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to allow us to make attacks on our <i>betes noires</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;but the paper must keep on its lines. M.
      Chatelet is very wroth; we shall not let him off for a week yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came here to ask for an explanation,&rdquo; said Vernou. &ldquo;The Imperial buck
      found old Giroudeau at home; and old Giroudeau told him, with all the
      coolness in the world, that Philippe Bridau wrote the article. Philippe
      asked the Baron to mention the time and the weapons, and there it ended.
      We are engaged at this moment in offering excuses to the Baron in
      to-morrow&rsquo;s issue. Every phrase is a stab for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your teeth in him and he will come round to me,&rdquo; said Finot; &ldquo;and it
      will look as if I were obliging him by appeasing you. He can say a word to
      the Ministry, and we can get something or other out of him&mdash;an
      assistant schoolmaster&rsquo;s place, or a tobacconist&rsquo;s license. It is a lucky
      thing for us that we flicked him on the raw. Does anybody here care to
      take a serious article on Nathan for my new paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to Lucien,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Hector and Vernou will write articles
      in their papers at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, gentlemen; we shall meet each other face to face at Barbin&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
       said Finot, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien received some congratulations on his admission to the mighty army
      of journalists, and Lousteau explained that they could be sure of him.
      &ldquo;Lucien wants you all to sup in a body at the house of the fair Coralie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie is going on at the Gymnase,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen; it is understood that we push Coralie, eh? Put a
      few lines about her new engagement in your papers, and say something about
      her talent. Credit the management of the Gymnase with tack and
      discernment; will it do to say intelligence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, say intelligence,&rdquo; said Merlin; &ldquo;Frederic has something of
      Scribe&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, then, the manager of the Gymnase is the most perspicacious and
      far-sighted of men of business,&rdquo; said Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! don&rsquo;t write your articles on Nathan until we have come to an
      understanding; you shall hear why,&rdquo; said Etienne Lousteau. &ldquo;We ought to do
      something for our new comrade. Lucien here has two books to bring out&mdash;a
      volume of sonnets and a novel. The power of the paragraph should make him
      a great poet due in three months; and we will make use of his sonnets (<i>Marguerites</i>
      is the title) to run down odes, ballads, and reveries, and all the
      Romantic poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a droll thing if the sonnets were no good after all,&rdquo; said
      Vernou.&mdash;&ldquo;What do you yourself think of your sonnets, Lucien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what do you think of them?&rdquo; asked one of the two whom Lucien did not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all right, gentlemen; I give you my word,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, that will do for me,&rdquo; said Vernou; &ldquo;I will heave your book at
      the poets of the sacristy; I am tired of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Dauriat declines to take the <i>Marguerites</i> this evening, we will
      attack him by pitching into Nathan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will Nathan say?&rdquo; cried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      His five colleagues burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he will be delighted,&rdquo; said Vernou. &ldquo;You will see how we manage these
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is one of us?&rdquo; said one of the two journalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Frederic; no tricks.&mdash;We are all working for you, Lucien,
      you see; you must stand by us when your turn comes. We are all friends of
      Nathan&rsquo;s, and we are attacking him. Now, let us divide Alexander&rsquo;s empire.&mdash;Frederic,
      will you take the Francais and the Odeon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If these gentlemen are willing,&rdquo; returned the person addressed as
      Frederic. The others nodded assent, but Lucien saw a gleam of jealousy
      here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am keeping the Opera, the Italiens, and the Opera-Comique,&rdquo; put in
      Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about me? Am I to have no theatres at all?&rdquo; asked the second
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, Hector can let you have the Varietes, and Lucien can spare you
      the Porte Saint-Martin.&mdash;Let him have the Porte Saint-Martin, Lucien,
      he is wild about Fanny Beaupre; and you can take the Cirque-Olympique in
      exchange. I shall have Bobino and the Funambules and Madame Saqui. Now,
      what have we for to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, be brilliant for my first number. The Baron du Chatelet and
      his cuttlefish bone will not last for a week, and the writer of <i>Le
      Solitaire</i> is worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;Sosthenes-Demosthenes&rsquo; is stale too,&rdquo; said Vernou; &ldquo;everybody has
      taken it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, we want a new set of ninepins,&rdquo; said Frederic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose that we take the virtuous representatives of the Right?&rdquo;
       suggested Lousteau. &ldquo;We might say that M. de Bonald has sweaty feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us begin a series of sketches of Ministerialist orators,&rdquo; suggested
      Hector Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do that, youngster; you know them; they are your own party,&rdquo; said
      Lousteau; &ldquo;you could indulge any little private grudges of your own. Pitch
      into Beugnot and Syrieys de Mayrinhac and the rest. You might have the
      sketches ready in advance, and we shall have something to fall back upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How if we invented one or two cases of refusal of burial with aggravating
      circumstances?&rdquo; asked Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not follow in the tracks of the big Constitutional papers; they have
      pigeon-holes full of ecclesiastical <i>canards</i>,&rdquo; retorted Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Canards</i>?&rdquo; repeated Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is our word for a scrap of fiction told for true, put in to enliven
      the column of morning news when it is flat. We owe the discovery to
      Benjamin Franklin, the inventor of the lightning conductor and the
      republic. That journalist completely deceived the Encyclopaedists by his
      transatlantic <i>canards</i>. Raynal gives two of them for facts in his <i>Histoire
      philosophique des Indes</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that,&rdquo; said Vernou. &ldquo;What were the stories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One was a tale about an Englishman and a negress who helped him to
      escape; he sold the woman for a slave after getting her with child himself
      to enhance her value. The other was the eloquent defence of a young woman
      brought before the authorities for bearing a child out of wedlock.
      Franklin owned to the fraud in Necker&rsquo;s house when he came to Paris, much
      to the confusion of French philosophism. Behold how the New World twice
      set a bad example to the Old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In journalism,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;everything that is probable is true. That
      is an axiom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Criminal procedure is based on the same rule,&rdquo; said Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we meet here at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and with that they rose, and
      the sitting broke up with the most affecting demonstrations of intimacy
      and good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done to Finot, Lucien, that he should make a special
      arrangement with you? You are the only one that he has bound to himself,&rdquo;
       said Etienne Lousteau, as they came downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Nothing. It was his own proposal,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, if you should make your own terms with him, I should
      be delighted; we should, both of us, be the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the ground floor they found Finot. He stepped across to Lousteau and asked
      him into the so-called private office. Giroudeau immediately put a couple
      of stamped agreements before Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign your agreement,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the new editor will think the whole
      thing was arranged yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, reading the document, overheard fragments of a tolerably warm
      dispute within as to the line of conduct and profits of the paper. Etienne
      Lousteau wanted his share of the blackmail levied by Giroudeau; and, in
      all probability, the matter was compromised, for the pair came out
      perfectly good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will meet at Dauriat&rsquo;s, Lucien, in the Wooden Galleries at eight
      o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Etienne Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man appeared, meanwhile, in search of employment, wearing the same
      nervous shy look with which Lucien himself had come to the office so short
      a while ago; and in his secret soul Lucien felt amused as he watched
      Giroudeau playing off the same tactics with which the old campaigner had
      previously foiled him. Self-interest opened his eyes to the necessity of
      the manoeuvres which raised well-nigh insurmountable barriers between
      beginners and the upper room where the elect were gathered together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contributors don&rsquo;t get very much as it is,&rdquo; he said, addressing
      Giroudeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were more of you, there would be so much less,&rdquo; retorted the
      captain. &ldquo;So there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old campaigner swung his loaded cane, and went down coughing as usual.
      Out in the street he was amazed to see a handsome carriage waiting on the
      boulevard for Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are the army nowadays,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we are the civilians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Lucien, as he drove away with Coralie, &ldquo;these young
      writers seem to me to be the best fellows alive. Here am I a journalist,
      sure of making six hundred francs a month if I work like a horse. But I
      shall find a publisher for my two books, and I will write others; for my
      friends will insure a success. And so, Coralie, &lsquo;<i>vogue le galere</i>!&rsquo; 
      as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make your way, dear boy; but you must not be as good-natured as
      you are good-looking; it would be the ruin of you. Be ill-natured, that is
      the proper thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coralie and Lucien drove in the Bois de Boulogne, and again they met the
      Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, Mme. de Bargeton and the Baron du Chatelet. Mme. de
      Bargeton gave Lucien a languishing glance which might be taken as a
      greeting. Camusot had ordered the best possible dinner; and Coralie,
      feeling that she was rid of her adorer, was more charming to the poor
      silk-mercer than she had ever been in the fourteen months during which
      their connection lasted; he had never seen her so kindly, so enchantingly
      lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;let us keep near her anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence, Camusot made secret overtures. He promised Coralie an
      income of six thousand livres; he would transfer the stock in the funds
      into her name (his wife knew nothing about the investment) if only she
      would consent to be his mistress still. He would shut his eyes to her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And betray such an angel?... Why, just look at him, you old fossil, and
      look at yourself!&rdquo; and her eyes turned to her poet. Camusot had pressed
      Lucien to drink till the poet&rsquo;s head was rather cloudy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it; Camusot made up his mind to wait till sheer want
      should give him this woman a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can only be your friend,&rdquo; he said, as he kissed her on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went from Coralie and Camusot to the Wooden Galleries. What a
      change had been wrought in his mind by his initiation into Journalism! He
      mixed fearlessly now with the crowd which surged to and fro in the
      buildings; he even swaggered a little because he had a mistress; and he
      walked into Dauriat&rsquo;s shop in an offhand manner because he was a
      journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself among distinguished men; gave a hand to Blondet and
      Nathan and Finot, and to all the coterie with whom he had been
      fraternizing for a week. He was a personage, he thought, and he flattered
      himself that he surpassed his comrades. That little flick of the wine did
      him admirable service; he was witty, he showed that he could &ldquo;howl with
      the wolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the tacit approval, the praises spoken and unspoken on which he
      had counted, were not forthcoming. He noticed the first stirrings of
      jealousy among a group, less curious, perhaps, than anxious to know the
      place which this newcomer might take, and the exact portion of the
      sum-total of profits which he would probably secure and swallow. Lucien
      only saw smiles on two faces&mdash;Finot, who regarded him as a mine to be
      exploited, and Lousteau, who considered that he had proprietary rights in
      the poet, looked glad to see him. Lousteau had begun already to assume the
      airs of an editor; he tapped sharply on the window-panes of Dauriat&rsquo;s
      private office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, my friend,&rdquo; cried a voice within as the publisher&rsquo;s face
      appeared above the green curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment lasted an hour, and finally Lucien and Etienne were admitted
      into the sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you thought over our friend&rsquo;s proposal?&rdquo; asked Etienne
      Lousteau, now an editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Dauriat, lolling like a sultan in his chair. &ldquo;I have
      read the volume. And I submitted it to a man of taste, a good judge; for I
      don&rsquo;t pretend to understand these things myself. I myself, my friend, buy
      reputations ready-made, as the Englishman bought his love affairs.&mdash;You
      are as great as a poet as you are handsome as a man, my boy,&rdquo; pronounced
      Dauriat. &ldquo;Upon my word and honor (I don&rsquo;t tell you that as a publisher,
      mind), your sonnets are magnificent; no sign of effort about them, as is
      natural when a man writes with inspiration and verve. You know your craft,
      in fact, one of the good points of the new school. Your volume of <i>Marguerites</i>
      is a fine book, but there is no business in it, and it is not worth my
      while to meddle with anything but a very big affair. In conscience, I
      won&rsquo;t take your sonnets. It would be impossible to push them; there is not
      enough in the thing to pay the expenses of a big success. You will not
      keep to poetry besides; this book of yours will be your first and last
      attempt of the kind. You are young; you bring me the everlasting volume of
      early verse which every man of letters writes when he leaves school, he
      thinks a lot of it at the time, and laughs at it later on. Lousteau, your
      friend, has a poem put away somewhere among his old socks, I&rsquo;ll warrant.
      Haven&rsquo;t you a poem that you thought a good deal of once, Lousteau?&rdquo;
       inquired Dauriat, with a knowing glance at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I be writing prose otherwise, eh?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see! He has never said a word to me about it, for our friend
      understands business and the trade,&rdquo; continued Dauriat. &ldquo;For me the
      question is not whether you are a great poet, I know that,&rdquo; he added,
      stroking down Lucien&rsquo;s pride; &ldquo;you have a great deal, a very great deal of
      merit; if I were only just starting in business, I should make the mistake
      of publishing your book. But in the first place, my sleeping partners and
      those at the back of me are cutting off my supplies; I dropped twenty
      thousand francs over poetry last year, and that is enough for them; they
      will not hear of any more just now, and they are my masters. Nevertheless,
      that is not the question. I admit that you may be a great poet, but will
      you be a prolific writer? Will you hatch sonnets regularly? Will you run
      into ten volumes? Is there business in it? Of course not. You will be a
      delightful prose writer; you have too much sense to spoil your style with
      tagging rhymes together. You have a chance to make thirty thousand francs
      per annum by writing for the papers, and you will not exchange that chance
      for three thousand francs made with difficulty by your hemistiches and
      strophes and tomfoolery&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that he is on the paper, Dauriat?&rdquo; put in Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dauriat answered. &ldquo;Yes, I saw his article, and in his own interests
      I decline the <i>Marguerites</i>. Yes, sir, in six months&rsquo; time I shall
      have paid you more money for the articles that I shall ask you to write
      than for your poetry that will not sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fame?&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat and Lousteau laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;there be illusions left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fame means ten years of sticking to work, and a hundred thousand francs
      lost or made in the publishing trade. If you find anybody mad enough to
      print your poetry for you, you will feel some respect for me in another
      twelvemonth, when you have had time to see the outcome of the
      transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the manuscript here?&rdquo; Lucien asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, my friend,&rdquo; said Dauriat. The publisher&rsquo;s manner towards
      Lucien had sweetened singularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien took up the roll without looking at the string, so sure he felt
      that Dauriat had read his <i>Marguerites</i>. He went out with Lousteau,
      seemingly neither disconcerted nor dissatisfied. Dauriat went with them
      into the shop, talking of his newspaper and Lousteau&rsquo;s daily, while Lucien
      played with the manuscript of the <i>Marguerites</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that Dauriat has read your sonnets or sent them to any one
      else?&rdquo; Etienne Lousteau snatched an opportunity to whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the string.&rdquo; Lucien looked down at the blot of ink, and saw that
      the mark on the string still coincided; he turned white with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of the sonnets was it that you particularly liked?&rdquo; he asked,
      turning to the publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all of them remarkable, my friend; but the sonnet on the <i>Marguerite</i>
      is delightful, the closing thought is fine, and exquisitely expressed. I
      felt sure from that sonnet that your prose work would command a success,
      and I spoke to Finot about you at once. Write articles for us, and we will
      pay you well for them. Fame is a very fine thing, you see, but don&rsquo;t
      forget the practical and solid, and take every chance that turns up. When
      you have made money, you can write poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poet dashed out of the shop to avoid an explosion. He was furious.
      Lousteau followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy, pray keep cool. Take men as they are&mdash;for means to an
      end. Do you wish for revenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any price,&rdquo; muttered the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a copy of Nathan&rsquo;s book. Dauriat has just given it to me. The
      second edition is coming out to-morrow; read the book again, and knock off
      an article demolishing it. Felicien Vernou cannot endure Nathan, for he
      thinks that Nathan&rsquo;s success will injure his own forthcoming book. It is a
      craze with these little minds to fancy that there is not room for two
      successes under the sun; so he will see that your article finds a place in
      the big paper for which he writes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is there to be said against the book; it is good work!&rdquo; cried
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say! you must learn your trade,&rdquo; said Lousteau, laughing. &ldquo;Given
      that the book was a masterpiece, under the stroke of your pen it must turn
      to dull trash, dangerous and unwholesome stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You turn all the good points into bad ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am incapable of such a juggler&rsquo;s feat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, a journalist is a juggler; a man must make up his mind to
      the drawbacks of the calling. Look here! I am not a bad fellow; this is
      the way <i>I</i> should set to work myself. Attention! You might begin by
      praising the book, and amuse yourself a while by saying what you really
      think. &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; says the reader, &lsquo;this critic is not jealous; he will be
      impartial, no doubt,&rsquo; and from that point your public will think that your
      criticism is a piece of conscientious work. Then, when you have won your
      reader&rsquo;s confidence, you will regret that you must blame the tendency and
      influence of such work upon French literature. &lsquo;Does not France,&rsquo; you will
      say, &lsquo;sway the whole intellectual world? French writers have kept Europe
      in the path of analysis and philosophical criticism from age to age by
      their powerful style and the original turn given by them to ideas.&rsquo; Here,
      for the benefit of the philistine, insert a panegyric on Voltaire,
      Rousseau, Diderot, Montesquieu, and Buffon. Hold forth upon the inexorable
      French language; show how it spreads a varnish, as it were, over thought.
      Let fall a few aphorisms, such as&mdash;&lsquo;A great writer in France is
      invariably a great man; he writes in a language which compels him to
      think; it is otherwise in other countries&rsquo;&mdash;and so on, and so on.
      Then, to prove your case, draw a comparison between Rabener, the German
      satirical moralist, and La Bruyere. Nothing gives a critic such an air as
      an apparent familiarity with foreign literature. Kant is Cousin&rsquo;s
      pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once on that ground you bring out a word which sums up the French men of
      genius of the eighteenth century for the benefit of simpletons&mdash;you
      call that literature the &lsquo;literature of ideas.&rsquo; Armed with this
      expression, you fling all the mighty dead at the heads of the illustrious
      living. You explain that in the present day a new form of literature has
      sprung up; that dialogue (the easiest form of writing) is overdone, and
      description dispenses with any need for thinking on the part of the author
      or reader. You bring up the fiction of Voltaire, Diderot, Sterne, and Le
      Sage, so trenchant, so compact of the stuff of life; and turn from them to
      the modern novel, composed of scenery and word-pictures and metaphor and
      the dramatic situations, of which Scott is full. Invention may be
      displayed in such work, but there is no room for anything else. &lsquo;The
      romance after the manner of Scott is a mere passing fashion in
      literature,&rsquo; you will say, and fulminate against the fatal way in which
      ideas are diluted and beaten thin; cry out against a style within the
      reach of any intellect, for any one can commence author at small expense
      in a way of literature, which you can nickname the &lsquo;literature of
      imagery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you fall upon Nathan with your argument, and establish it beyound
      cavil that he is a mere imitator with an appearance of genius. The concise
      grand style of the eighteenth century is lacking; you show that the author
      substitutes events for sentiments. Action and stir is not life; he gives
      you pictures, but no ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out with such phrases, and people will take them up.&mdash;In spite
      of the merits of the work, it seems to you to be a dangerous, nay, a fatal
      precedent. It throws open the gates of the temple of Fame to the crowd;
      and in the distance you descry a legion of petty authors hastening to
      imitate this novel and easy style of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you launch out into resounding lamentations over the decadence and
      decline of taste, and slip in eulogies of Messieurs Etienne Jouy, Tissot,
      Gosse, Duval, Jay, Benjamin Constant, Aignan, Baour-Lormian, Villemain,
      and the whole Liberal-Bonapartist chorus who patronize Vernou&rsquo;s paper.
      Next you draw a picture of that glorious phalanx of writers repelling the
      invasion of the Romantics; these are the upholders of ideas and style as
      against metaphor and balderdash; the modern representatives of the school
      of Voltaire as opposed to the English and German schools, even as the
      seventeen heroic deputies of the Left fought the battle for the nation
      against the Ultras of the Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, under cover of names respected by the immense majority of
      Frenchmen (who will always be against the Government), you can crush
      Nathan; for although his work is far above the average, it confirms the
      bourgeois taste for literature without ideas. And after that, you
      understand, it is no longer a question of Nathan and his book, but of
      France and the glory of France. It is the duty of all honest and
      courageous pens to make strenuous opposition to these foreign
      importations. And with that you flatter your readers. Shrewd French
      mother-wit is not easily caught napping. If publishers, by ways which you
      do not choose to specify, have stolen a success, the reading public very
      soon judges for itself, and corrects the mistakes made by some five
      hundred fools, who always rush to the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that the publisher who sold a first edition of the book is audacious
      indeed to issue a second, and express regret that so clever a man does not
      know the taste of the country better. There is the gist of it. Just a
      sprinkle of the salt of wit and a dash of vinegar to bring out the flavor,
      and Dauriat will be done to a turn. But mind that you end with seeming to
      pity Nathan for a mistake, and speak of him as of a man from whom
      contemporary literature may look for great things if he renounces these
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was amazed at this talk from Lousteau. As the journalist spoke, the
      scales fell from his eyes; he beheld new truths of which he had never
      before caught so much as a glimpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this that you are saying is quite true and just,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were not, how could you make it tell against Nathan&rsquo;s book?&rdquo; asked
      Lousteau. &ldquo;That is the first manner of demolishing a book, my boy; it is
      the pickaxe style of criticism. But there are plenty of other ways. Your
      education will complete itself in time. When you are absolutely obliged to
      speak of a man whom you do not like, for proprietors and editors are
      sometimes under compulsion, you bring out a neutral special article. You
      put the title of the book at the head of it, and begin with general
      remarks, on the Greeks and the Romans if you like, and wind up with&mdash;&lsquo;and
      this brings us to Mr. So-and-so&rsquo;s book, which will form the subject of a
      second article.&rsquo; The second article never appears, and in this way you
      snuff out the book between two promises. But in this case you are writing
      down, not Nathan, but Dauriat; he needs the pickaxe style. If the book is
      really good, the pickaxe does no harm; but it goes to the core of it if it
      is bad. In the first case, no one but the publisher is any the worse; in
      the second, you do the public a service. Both methods, moreover, are
      equally serviceable in political criticism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau&rsquo;s cruel lesson opened up possibilities for Lucien&rsquo;s
      imagination. He understood this craft to admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go to the office,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;we shall find our friends
      there, and we will agree among ourselves to charge at Nathan; they will
      laugh, you will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the Rue Saint-Fiacre, they went up to the room in the roof
      where the paper was made up, and Lucien was surprised and gratified no
      less to see the alacrity with which his comrades proceeded to demolish
      Nathan&rsquo;s book. Hector Merlin took up a piece of paper and wrote a few
      lines for his own newspaper.&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A second edition of M. Nathan&rsquo;s book is announced. We had
  intended to keep silence with regard to that work, but its
  apparent success obliges us to publish an article, not so much
  upon the book itself as upon certain tendencies of the new school
  of literature.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the head of the &ldquo;Facetiae&rdquo; in the morning&rsquo;s paper, Lousteau inserted
      the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;M. Dauriat is bringing out a second edition of M. Nathan&rsquo;s book.
  Evidently he does not know the legal maxim, <i>Non bis in idem</i>. All
  honor to rash courage.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Lousteau&rsquo;s words had been like a torch for burning; Lucien&rsquo;s hot desire to
      be revenged on Dauriat took the place of conscience and inspiration. For
      three days he never left Coralie&rsquo;s room; he sat at work by the fire,
      waited upon by Berenice; petted, in moments of weariness, by the silent
      and attentive Coralie; till, at the end of that time, he had made a fair
      copy of about three columns of criticism, and an astonishingly good piece
      of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening when he ran round to the office, found
      his associates, and read over his work to an attentive audience. Felicien
      said not a syllable. He took up the manuscript, and made off with it
      pell-mell down the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has come to him?&rdquo; cried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken your article straight to the printer,&rdquo; said Hector Merlin.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a masterpiece; not a line to add, nor a word to take out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no need to do more than show you the way,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see Nathan&rsquo;s face when he reads this to-morrow,&rdquo; said
      another contributor, beaming with gentle satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as well to have you for a friend,&rdquo; remarked Hector Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will do?&rdquo; Lucien asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blondet and Vignon will feel bad,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a short article which I have knocked together for you,&rdquo; began
      Lucien; &ldquo;if it takes, I could write you a series.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it over,&rdquo; said Lousteau, and Lucien read the first of the delightful
      short papers which made the fortune of the little newspaper; a series of
      sketches of Paris life, a portrait, a type, an ordinary event, or some of
      the oddities of the great city. This specimen&mdash;&ldquo;The Man in the
      Street&rdquo;&mdash;was written in a way that was fresh and original; the
      thoughts were struck out by the shock of the words, the sounding ring of
      the adverbs and adjectives caught the reader&rsquo;s ear. The paper was as
      different from the serious and profound article on Nathan as the <i>Lettres
      persanes</i> from the <i>Esprit des lois</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a born journalist,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;It shall go in to-morrow. Do
      as much of this sort of thing as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by the by,&rdquo; said Merlin, &ldquo;Dauriat is furious about those two
      bombshells hurled into his magazine. I have just come from him. He was
      hurling imprecations, and in such a rage with Finot, who told him that he
      had sold his paper to you. As for me, I took him aside and just said a
      word in his ear. &lsquo;The <i>Marguerites</i> will cost you dear,&rsquo; I told him.
      &lsquo;A man of talent comes to you, you turn the cold shoulder on him, and send
      him into the arms of the newspapers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dauriat will be dumfounded by the article on Nathan,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Do
      you see now what journalism is, Lucien? Your revenge is beginning to tell.
      The Baron Chatelet came here this morning for your address. There was a
      cutting article upon him in this morning&rsquo;s issue; he is a weakling, that
      buck of the Empire, and he has lost his head. Have you seen the paper? It
      is a funny article. Look, &lsquo;Funeral of the Heron, and the Cuttlefish-bone&rsquo;s
      lament.&rsquo; Mme. de Bargeton is called the Cuttlefish-bone now, and no
      mistake, and Chatelet is known everywhere as Baron Heron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien took up the paper, and could not help laughing at Vernou&rsquo;s
      extremely clever skit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will capitulate soon,&rdquo; said Hector Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien merrily assisted at the manufacture of epigrams and jokes at the
      end of the paper; and the associates smoked and chatted over the day&rsquo;s
      adventures, over the foibles of some among their number, or some new bit
      of personal gossip. From their witty, malicious, bantering talk, Lucien
      gained a knowledge of the inner life of literature, and of the manners and
      customs of the craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While they are setting up the paper, I will go round with you and
      introduce you to the managers of your theatres, and take you behind the
      scenes,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;And then we will go to the Panorama-Dramatique,
      and have a frolic in their dressing-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arm-in-arm, they went from theatre to theatre. Lucien was introduced to
      this one and that, and enthroned as a dramatic critic. Managers
      complimented him, actresses flung him side glances; for every one of them
      knew that this was the critic who, by a single article, had gained an
      engagement at the Gymnase, with twelve thousand francs a year, for
      Coralie, and another for Florine at the Panorama-Dramatique with eight
      thousand francs. Lucien was a man of importance. The little ovations
      raised Lucien in his own eyes, and taught him to know his power. At eleven
      o&rsquo;clock the pair arrived at the Panorama-Dramatique; Lucien with a
      careless air that worked wonders. Nathan was there. Nathan held out a
      hand, which Lucien squeezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my masters, so you have a mind to floor me, have you?&rdquo; said Nathan,
      looking from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just you wait till to-morrow, my dear fellow, and you shall see how
      Lucien has taken you in hand. Upon my word, you will be pleased. A piece
      of serious criticism like that is sure to do a book good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien reddened with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it severe?&rdquo; inquired Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is serious,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no harm done,&rdquo; Nathan rejoined. &ldquo;Hector Merlin in the
      greenroom of the Vaudeville was saying that I had been cut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him talk, and wait,&rdquo; cried Lucien, and took refuge in Coralie&rsquo;s
      dressing-room. Coralie, in her alluring costume, had just come off the
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, as Lucien and Coralie sat at breakfast, a carriage drove
      along the Rue de Vendome. The street was quiet enough, so that they could
      hear the light sound made by an elegant cabriolet; and there was that in
      the pace of the horse, and the manner of pulling up at the door, which
      tells unmistakably of a thoroughbred. Lucien went to the window, and
      there, in fact, beheld a splendid English horse, and no less a person than
      Dauriat flinging the reins to his man as he stepped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the publisher, Coralie,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wait, Berenice,&rdquo; Coralie said at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien smiled at her presence of mind, and kissed her with a great rush of
      tenderness. This mere girl had made his interests hers in a wonderful way;
      she was quick-witted where he was concerned. The apparition of the
      insolent publisher, the sudden and complete collapse of that prince of
      charlatans, was due to circumstances almost entirely forgotten, so utterly
      has the book trade changed during the last fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1816 to 1827, when newspaper reading-rooms were only just beginning
      to lend new books, the fiscal law pressed more heavily than ever upon
      periodical publications, and necessity created the invention of
      advertisements. Paragraphs and articles in the newspapers were the only
      means of advertisement known in those days; and French newspapers before
      the year 1822 were so small, that the largest sheet of those times was not
      so large as the smallest daily paper of ours. Dauriat and Ladvocat, the
      first publishers to make a stand against the tyranny of journalists, were
      also the first to use the placards which caught the attention of Paris by
      strange type, striking colors, vignettes, and (at a later time) by
      lithograph illustrations, till a placard became a fairy-tale for the eyes,
      and not unfrequently a snare for the purse of the amateur. So much
      originality indeed was expended on placards in Paris, that one of that
      peculiar kind of maniacs, known as a collector, possesses a complete
      series.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the placard was confined to the shop-windows and stalls upon the
      Boulevards in Paris; afterwards it spread all over France, till it was
      supplanted to some extent by a return to advertisements in the newspapers.
      But the placard, nevertheless, which continues to strike the eye, after
      the advertisement and the book which is advertised are both forgotten,
      will always be among us; it took a new lease of life when walls were
      plastered with posters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspaper advertising, the offspring of heavy stamp duties, a high rate of
      postage, and the heavy deposits of caution-money required by the
      government as security for good behavior, is within the reach of all who
      care to pay for it, and has turned the fourth page of every journal into a
      harvest field alike for the speculator and the Inland Revenue Department.
      The press restrictions were invented in the time of M. de Villele, who had
      a chance, if he had but known it, of destroying the power of journalism by
      allowing newspapers to multiply till no one took any notice of them; but
      he missed his opportunity, and a sort of privilege was created, as it
      were, by the almost insuperable difficulties put in the way of starting a
      new venture. So, in 1821, the periodical press might be said to have power
      of life and death over the creations of the brain and the publishing
      trade. A few lines among the items of news cost a fearful amount.
      Intrigues were multiplied in newspaper offices; and of a night when the
      columns were divided up, and this or that article was put in or left out
      to suit the space, the printing-room became a sort of battlefield; so much
      so, that the largest publishing firms had writers in their pay to insert
      short articles in which many ideas are put in little space. Obscure
      journalists of this stamp were only paid after the insertion of the items,
      and not unfrequently spent the night in the printing-office to make sure
      that their contributions were not omitted; sometimes putting in a long
      article, obtained heaven knows how, sometimes a few lines of a puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manners and customs of journalism and of the publishing houses have
      since changed so much, that many people nowadays will not believe what
      immense efforts were made by writers and publishers of books to secure a
      newspaper puff; the martyrs of glory, and all those who are condemned to
      the penal servitude of a life-long success, were reduced to such shifts,
      and stooped to depths of bribery and corruption as seem fabulous to-day.
      Every kind of persuasion was brought to bear on journalists&mdash;dinners,
      flattery, and presents. The following story will throw more light on the
      close connection between the critic and the publisher than any quantity of
      flat assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was once upon a time an editor of an important paper, a clever
      writer with a prospect of becoming a statesman; he was young in those
      days, and fond of pleasure, and he became the favorite of a well-known
      publishing house. One Sunday the wealthy head of the firm was entertaining
      several of the foremost journalists of the time in the country, and the
      mistress of the house, then a young and pretty woman, went to walk in her
      park with the illustrious visitor. The head-clerk of the firm, a cool,
      steady, methodical German with nothing but business in his head, was
      discussing a project with one of the journalists, and as they chatted they
      walked on into the woods beyond the park. In among the thickets the German
      thought he caught a glimpse of his hostess, put up his eyeglass, made a
      sign to his young companion to be silent, and turned back, stepping
      softly.&mdash;&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; asked the journalist.&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing
      particular,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;Our affair of the long article is settled.
      To-morrow we shall have at least three columns in the <i>Debats</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another anecdote will show the influence of a single article.
    </p>
    <p>
      A book of M. de Chateaubriand&rsquo;s on the last of the Stuarts was for some
      time a &ldquo;nightingale&rdquo; on the bookseller&rsquo;s shelves. A single article in the
      <i>Journal des Debats</i> sold the work in a week. In those days, when
      there were no lending libraries, a publisher would sell an edition of ten
      thousand copies of a book by a Liberal if it was well reviewed by the
      Opposition papers; but then the Belgian pirated editions were not as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparatory attacks made by Lucien&rsquo;s friends, followed up by his
      article on Nathan, proved efficacious; they stopped the sale of his book.
      Nathan escaped with the mortification; he had been paid; he had nothing to
      lose; but Dauriat was like to lose thirty thousand francs. The trade in
      new books may, in fact, be summed up much on this wise. A ream of blank
      paper costs fifteen francs, a ream of printed paper is worth anything
      between a hundred sous and a hundred crowns, according to its success; a
      favorable or unfavorable review at a critical time often decides the
      question; and Dauriat having five hundred reams of printed paper on hand,
      hurried to make terms with Lucien. The sultan was now the slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for some time, fidgeting and making as much noise as he
      could while parleying with Berenice, he at last obtained speech of Lucien;
      and, arrogant publisher though he was, he came in with the radiant air of
      a courtier in the royal presence, mingled, however, with a certain
      self-sufficiency and easy good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourselves, my little dears! How nice they look, just like
      a pair of turtle-doves! Who would think now, mademoiselle, that he, with
      that girl&rsquo;s face of his, could be a tiger with claws of steel, ready to
      tear a reputation to rags, just as he tears your wrappers, I&rsquo;ll be bound,
      when you are not quick enough to unfasten them,&rdquo; and he laughed before he
      had finished his jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, sitting down beside Lucien.&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle,
      I am Dauriat,&rdquo; he said, interrupting himself. He judged it expedient to
      fire his name at her like a pistol shot, for he considered that Coralie
      was less cordial than she should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you breakfasted, monsieur; will you keep us company?&rdquo; asked Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; it is easier to talk at table,&rdquo; said Dauriat. &ldquo;Besides, by
      accepting your invitation I shall have a right to expect you to dine with
      my friend Lucien here, for we must be close friends now, hand and glove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berenice! Bring oysters, lemons, fresh butter, and champagne,&rdquo; said
      Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too clever not to know what has brought me here,&rdquo; said Dauriat,
      fixing his eyes on Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to buy my sonnets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. First of all, let us lay down our arms on both sides.&rdquo; As he
      spoke he took out a neat pocketbook, drew from it three bills for a
      thousand francs each, and laid them before Lucien with a suppliant air.
      &ldquo;Is monsieur content?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the poet. A sense of beatitude, for which no words exist,
      flooded his soul at the sight of that unhoped wealth. He controlled
      himself, but he longed to sing aloud, to jump for joy; he was ready to
      believe in Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp and in enchantment; he believed in his own
      genius, in short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the <i>Marguerites</i> are mine,&rdquo; continued Dauriat; &ldquo;but you will
      undertake not to attack my publications, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Marguerites</i> are yours, but I cannot pledge my pen; it is at
      the service of my friends, as theirs are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are one of my authors now. All my authors are my friends. So you
      won&rsquo;t spoil my business without warning me beforehand, so that I am
      prepared, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your fame!&rdquo; and Dauriat raised his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you have read the <i>Marguerites</i>,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat was not disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, a publisher cannot pay a greater compliment than by buying your
      <i>Marguerites</i> unread. In six months&rsquo; time you will be a great poet.
      You will be written up; people are afraid of you; I shall have no
      difficulty in selling your book. I am the same man of business that I was
      four days ago. It is not I who have changed; it is <i>you</i>. Last week
      your sonnets were so many cabbage leaves for me; to-day your position has
      ranked them beside Delavigne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;if you have not read my sonnets, you have read my
      article.&rdquo; With the sultan&rsquo;s pleasure of possessing a fair mistress, and
      the certainty of success, he had grown satirical and adorably impertinent
      of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend; do you think I should have come here in such a hurry but
      for that? That terrible article of yours is very well written, worse luck.
      Oh! you have a very great gift, my boy. Take my advice and make the most
      of your vogue,&rdquo; he added, with good humor, which masked the extreme
      insolence of the speech. &ldquo;But have you yourself a copy of the paper? Have
      you seen your article in print?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;though this is the first long piece of prose
      which I have published; but Hector will have sent a copy to my address in
      the Rue Charlot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;read!&rdquo;... cried Dauriat, copying Talma&rsquo;s gesture in <i>Manlius</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien took the paper but Coralie snatched it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first-fruits of your pen belong to me, as you well know,&rdquo; she
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat was unwontedly courtier-like and complimentary. He was afraid of
      Lucien, and therefore he asked him to a great dinner which he was giving
      to a party of journalists towards the end of the week, and Coralie was
      included in the invitation. He took the <i>Marguerites</i> away with him
      when he went, asking <i>his</i> poet to look in when he pleased in the
      Wooden Galleries, and the agreement should be ready for his signature.
      Dauriat never forgot the royal airs with which he endeavored to overawe
      superficial observers, and to impress them with the notion that he was a
      Maecenas rather than a publisher; at this moment he left the three
      thousand francs, waving away in lordly fashion the receipt which Lucien
      offered, kissed Coralie&rsquo;s hand, and took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear love, would you have seen many of these bits of paper if you
      had stopped in your hole in the Rue de Cluny, prowling about among the
      musty old books in the Bibliotheque de Sainte-Genevieve?&rdquo; asked Coralie,
      for she knew the whole story of Lucien&rsquo;s life by this time. &ldquo;Those little
      friends of yours in the Rue des Quatre-Vents are great ninnies, it seems
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brothers of the <i>cenacle</i>! And Lucien could hear the verdict and
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen himself in print; he had just experienced the ineffable joy of
      the author, that first pleasurable thrill of gratified vanity which comes
      but once. The full import and bearing of his article became apparent to
      him as he read and re-read it. The garb of print is to manuscript as the
      stage is to women; it brings beauties and defects to light, killing and
      giving life; the fine thoughts and the faults alike stare you in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, in his excitement and rapture, gave not another thought to Nathan.
      Nathan was a stepping-stone for him&mdash;that was all; and he (Lucien)
      was happy exceedingly&mdash;he thought himself rich. The money brought by
      Dauriat was a very Potosi for the lad who used to go about unnoticed
      through the streets of Angouleme and down the steep path into L&rsquo;Houmeau to
      Postel&rsquo;s garret, where his whole family had lived upon an income of twelve
      hundred francs. The pleasures of his life in Paris must inevitably dim the
      memories of those days; but so keen were they, that, as yet, he seemed to
      be back again in the Place du Murier. He thought of Eve, his beautiful,
      noble sister, of David his friend, and of his poor mother, and he sent
      Berenice out to change one of the notes. While she went he wrote a few
      lines to his family, and on the maid&rsquo;s return he sent her to the
      coach-office with a packet of five hundred francs addressed to his mother.
      He could not trust himself; he wanted to sent the money at once; later he
      might not be able to do it. Both Lucien and Coralie looked upon this
      restitution as a meritorious action. Coralie put her arms about her lover
      and kissed him, and thought him a model son and brother; she could not
      make enough of him, for generosity is a trait of character which delights
      these kindly creatures, who always carry their hearts in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a dinner now every day for a week,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we will make a
      little carnival; you have worked quite hard enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coralie, fain to delight in the beauty of a man whom all other women
      should envy her, took Lucien back to Staub. He was not dressed finely
      enough for her. Thence the lovers went to drive in the Bois de Boulogne,
      and came back to dine at Mme. du Val-Noble&rsquo;s. Rastignac, Bixiou, des
      Lupeaulx, Finot, Blondet, Vignon, the Baron de Nucingen, Beaudenord,
      Philippe Bridau, Conti, the great musician, all the artists and
      speculators, all the men who seek for violent sensations as a relief from
      immense labors, gave Lucien a welcome among them. And Lucien had gained
      confidence; he gave himself out in talk as though he had not to live by
      his wit, and was pronounced to be a &ldquo;clever fellow&rdquo; in the slang of the
      coterie of semi-comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we must wait and see what he has in him,&rdquo; said Theodore Gaillard, a
      poet patronized by the Court, who thought of starting a Royalist paper to
      be entitled the <i>Reveil</i> at a later day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Merlin and Lucien, Coralie and Mme. du Val-Noble, went to
      the Opera, where Merlin had a box. The whole party adjourned thither, and
      Lucien triumphant reappeared upon the scene of his first serious check.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked in the lobby, arm in arm with Merlin and Blondet, looking the
      dandies who had once made merry at his expense between the eyes. Chatelet
      was under his feet. He clashed glances with de Marsay, Vandenesse, and
      Manerville, the bucks of that day. And indeed Lucien, beautiful and
      elegantly arrayed, had caused a discussion in the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s box;
      Rastignac had paid a long visit, and the Marquise and Mme. de Bargeton put
      up their opera-glasses at Coralie. Did the sight of Lucien send a pang of
      regret through Mme. de Bargeton&rsquo;s heart? This thought was uppermost in the
      poet&rsquo;s mind. The longing for revenge aroused in him by the sight of the
      Corinne of Angouleme was as fierce as on that day when the lady and her
      cousin had cut him in the Champs-Elysees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you bring an amulet with you from the provinces?&rdquo;&mdash;It was
      Blondet who made this inquiry some few days later, when he called at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and found that Lucien was not yet risen.&mdash;&ldquo;His
      good looks are making ravages from cellar to garret, high and low,&rdquo;
       continued Blondet, kissing Coralie on the forehead. &ldquo;I have come to enlist
      you, dear fellow,&rdquo; he continued, grasping Lucien by the hand. &ldquo;Yesterday,
      at the Italiens, the Comtesse de Montcornet asked me to bring you to her
      house. You will not give a refusal to a charming woman? You meet people of
      the first fashion there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Lucien is nice, he will not go to see your Countess,&rdquo; put in Coralie.
      &ldquo;What call is there for him to show his face in fine society? He would
      only be bored there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a vested interest in him? Are you jealous of fine ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Coralie. &ldquo;They are worse than we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that, my pet?&rdquo; asked Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From their husbands,&rdquo; retorted she. &ldquo;You are forgetting that I once had
      six months of de Marsay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose, child, that <i>I</i> am particularly anxious to take such
      a handsome fellow as your poet to Mme. de Montcornet&rsquo;s house? If you
      object, let us consider that nothing has been said. But I don&rsquo;t fancy that
      the women are so much in question as a poor devil that Lucien pilloried in
      his newspaper; he is begging for mercy and peace. The Baron du Chatelet is
      imbecile enough to take the thing seriously. The Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, Mme.
      de Bargeton, and Mme. de Montcornet&rsquo;s set have taken up the Heron&rsquo;s cause;
      and I have undertaken to reconcile Petrarch and his Laura&mdash;Mme. de
      Bargeton and Lucien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried Lucien, the glow of the intoxication of revenge throbbing
      full-pulsed through every vein. &ldquo;Aha! so my foot is on their necks! You
      make me adore my pen, worship my friends, bow down to the fate-dispensing
      power of the press. I have not written a single sentence as yet upon the
      Heron and the Cuttlefish-bone.&mdash;I will go with you, my boy,&rdquo; he
      cried, catching Blondet by the waist; &ldquo;yes, I will go; but first, the
      couple shall feel the weight of <i>this</i>, for so light as it is.&rdquo; He
      flourished the pen which had written the article upon Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I will hurl a couple of columns at their heads.
      Then, we shall see. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Coralie, it is not love but
      revenge; revenge! And I will have it to the full!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man it is!&rdquo; said Blondet. &ldquo;If you but knew, Lucien, how rare such
      explosions are in this jaded Paris, you might appreciate yourself. You
      will be a precious scamp&rdquo; (the actual expression was a trifle stronger);
      &ldquo;you are in a fair way to be a power in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will get on,&rdquo; said Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he has come a good way already in six weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he should climb so high that he can reach a sceptre by treading
      over a corpse, he shall have Coralie&rsquo;s body for a stepping-stone,&rdquo; said
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a pair of lovers of the Golden Age,&rdquo; said Blondet.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      congratulate you on your big article,&rdquo; he added, turning to Lucien. &ldquo;There
      were a lot of new things in it. You are past master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau called with Hector Merlin and Vernou. Lucien was immensely
      flattered by this attention. Felicien Vernou brought a hundred francs for
      Lucien&rsquo;s article; it was felt that such a contributor must be well paid to
      attach him to the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie, looking round at the chapter of journalists, ordered in a
      breakfast from the <i>Cadran bleu</i>, the nearest restaurant, and asked
      her visitors to adjourn to her handsomely furnished dining-room when
      Berenice announced that the meal was ready. In the middle of the repast,
      when the champagne had gone to all heads, the motive of the visit came
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mean to make an enemy of Nathan, do you?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
      &ldquo;Nathan is a journalist, and he has friends; he might play you an ugly
      trick with your first book. You have your <i>Archer of Charles IX.</i> to
      sell, have you not? We went round to Nathan this morning; he is in a
      terrible way. But you will set about another article, and puff praise in
      his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! After my article against his book, would you have me say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole party cut him short with a shout of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ask him to supper here the day after to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You article was not signed,&rdquo; added Lousteau. &ldquo;Felicien, not being quite
      such a new hand as you are, was careful to put an initial C at the bottom.
      You can do that now with all your articles in his paper, which is pure
      unadulterated Left. We are all of us in the Opposition. Felicien was
      tactful enough not to compromise your future opinions. Hector&rsquo;s shop is
      Right Centre; you might sign your work on it with an L. If you cut a man
      up, you do it anonymously; if you praise him, it is just as well to put
      your name to your article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the signatures that trouble me,&rdquo; returned Lucien, &ldquo;but I cannot
      see anything to be said in favor of the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then did you really think as you wrote?&rdquo; asked Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thought you were cleverer than that, youngster,&rdquo; said Blondet. &ldquo;No.
      Upon my word, as I looked at that forehead of yours, I credited you with
      the omnipotence of the great mind&mdash;the power of seeing both sides of
      everything. In literature, my boy, every idea is reversible, and no man
      can take upon himself to decide which is the right or wrong side.
      Everything is bi-lateral in the domain of thought. Ideas are binary. Janus
      is a fable signifying criticism and the symbol of Genius. The Almighty
      alone is triform. What raises Moliere and Corneille above the rest of us
      but the faculty of saying one thing with an Alceste or an Octave, and
      another with a Philinte or a Cinna? Rousseau wrote a letter against
      dueling in the <i>Nouvelle</i> Heloise, and another in favor of it. Which
      of the two represented his own opinion? will you venture to take it upon
      yourself to decide? Which of us could give judgement for Clarissa or
      Lovelace, Hector or Achilles? Who was Homer&rsquo;s hero? What did Richardson
      himself think? It is the function of criticism to look at a man&rsquo;s work in
      all its aspects. We draw up our case, in short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really stick to your written opinions?&rdquo; asked Vernou, with a
      satirical expression. &ldquo;Why, we are retailers of phrases; that is how we
      make a livelihood. When you try to do a good piece of work&mdash;to write
      a book, in short&mdash;you can put your thoughts, yourself into it, and
      cling to it, and fight for it; but as for newspaper articles, read to-day
      and forgotten to-morrow, they are worth nothing in my eyes but the money
      that is paid for them. If you attach any importance to such drivel, you
      might as well make the sign of the Cross and invoke heaven when you sit
      down to write a tradesman&rsquo;s circular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one apparently was astonished at Lucien&rsquo;s scruples. The last rags of
      the boyish conscience were torn away, and he was invested with the <i>toga
      virilis</i> of journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what Nathan said by way of comforting himself after your
      criticism?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan exclaimed, &lsquo;Paragraphs pass away; but a great work lives!&rsquo; He will
      be here to supper in two days, and he will be sure to fall flat at your
      feet, and kiss your claws, and swear that you are a great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a funny thing,&rdquo; was Lucien&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Funny</i>&rdquo; repeated Blondet. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite willing, my friends,&rdquo; said Lucien, on whom the wine had begun
      to take effect. &ldquo;But what am I to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, refute yourself in three good columns in Merlin&rsquo;s paper. We have
      been enjoying the sight of Nathan&rsquo;s wrath; we have just been telling him
      that he owes us no little gratitude for getting up a hot controversy that
      will sell his second edition in a week. In his eyes at this present moment
      you are a spy, a scoundrel, a caitiff wretch; the day after to-morrow you
      will be a genius, an uncommonly clever fellow, one of Plutarch&rsquo;s men.
      Nathan will hug you and call you his best friend. Dauriat has been to see
      you; you have your three thousand francs; you have worked the trick! Now
      you want Nathan&rsquo;s respect and esteem. Nobody ought to be let in except the
      publisher. We must not immolate any one but an enemy. We should not talk
      like this if it were a question of some outsider, some inconvenient person
      who had made a name for himself without us and was not wanted; but Nathan
      is one of us. Blondet got some one to attack him in the <i>Mercure</i> for
      the pleasure of replying in the <i>Debats</i>. For which reason the first
      edition went off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, upon my word and honor, I cannot write two words in praise of
      that book&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have another hundred francs,&rdquo; interrupted Merlin. &ldquo;Nathan will
      have brought you in ten louis d&rsquo;or, to say nothing of an article that you
      might put in Finot&rsquo;s paper; you would get a hundred francs for writing
      that, and another hundred francs from Dauriat&mdash;total, twenty louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your way out of the difficulty,&rdquo; said Blondet, after some
      thought. &ldquo;Say that the envy that fastens on all good work, like wasps on
      ripe fruit, has attempted to set its fangs in this production. The
      captious critic, trying his best to find fault, has been obliged to invent
      theories for that purpose, and has drawn a distinction between two kinds
      of literature&mdash;&lsquo;the literature of ideas and the literature of
      imagery,&rsquo; as he calls them. On the heads of that, youngster, say that to
      give expression to ideas through imagery is the highest form of art. Try
      to show that all poetry is summed up in that, and lament that there is so
      little poetry in French; quote foreign criticisms on the unimaginative
      precision of our style, and then extol M. de Canalis and Nathan for the
      services they have done France by infusing a less prosaic spirit into the
      language. Knock your previous argument to pieces by calling attention to
      the fact that we have made progress since the eighteenth century.
      (Discover the &lsquo;progress,&rsquo; a beautiful word to mystify the bourgeois
      public.) Say that the new methods in literature concentrate all styles,
      comedy and tragedy, description, character-drawing and dialogues, in a
      series of pictures set in the brilliant frame of a plot which holds the
      reader&rsquo;s interest. The Novel, which demands sentiment, style, and imagery,
      is the greatest creation of modern days; it is the successor of stage
      comedy grown obsolete with its restrictions. Facts and ideas are all
      within the province of fiction. The intellect of an incisive moralist,
      like La Bruyere, the power of treating character as Moliere could treat
      it, the grand machinery of a Shakespeare, together with the portrayal of
      the most subtle shades of passion (the one treasury left untouched by our
      predecessors)&mdash;for all this the modern novel affords free scope. How
      far superior is all this to the cut-and-dried logic-chopping, the cold
      analysis to the eighteenth century!&mdash;&lsquo;The Novel,&rsquo; say sententiously,
      &lsquo;is the Epic grown amusing.&rsquo; Instance <i>Corinne</i>, bring Mme. de Stael
      up to support your argument. The eighteenth century called all things in
      question; it is the task of the nineteenth to conclude and speak the last
      word; and the last word of the nineteenth century has been for realities&mdash;realities
      which live however and move. Passion, in short, an element unknown in
      Voltaire&rsquo;s philosophy, has been brought into play. Here a diatribe against
      Voltaire, and as for Rousseau, his characters are polemics and systems
      masquerading. Julie and Claire are entelechies&mdash;informing spirit
      awaiting flesh and bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might slip off on a side issue at this, and say that we owe a new and
      original literature to the Peace and the Restoration of the Bourbons, for
      you are writing for a Right Centre paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoff at Founders of Systems. And cry with a glow of fine enthusiasm,
      &lsquo;Here are errors and misleading statements in abundance in our
      contemporary&rsquo;s work, and to what end? To depreciate a fine work, to
      deceive the public, and to arrive at this conclusion&mdash;&ldquo;A book that
      sells, does not sell.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Proh pudor</i>! (Mind you put <i>Proh pudor</i>!
      &lsquo;tis a harmless expletive that stimulates the reader&rsquo;s interest.) Foresee
      the approaching decadence of criticism, in fact. Moral&mdash;&lsquo;There is but
      one kind of literature, the literature which aims to please. Nathan has
      started upon a new way; he understands his epoch and fulfils the
      requirements of his age&mdash;the demand for drama, the natural demand of
      a century in which the political stage has become a permanent puppet show.
      Have we not seen four dramas in a score of years&mdash;the Revolution, the
      Directory, the Empire, and the Restoration?&rsquo; With that, wallow in
      dithyramb and eulogy, and the second edition shall vanish like smoke. This
      is the way to do it. Next Saturday put a review in our magazine, and sign
      it &lsquo;de Rubempre,&rsquo; out in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that final article say that &lsquo;fine work always brings about abundant
      controversy. This week such and such a paper contained such and such an
      article on Nathan&rsquo;s book, and such another paper made a vigorous reply.&rsquo; 
      Then you criticise the critics &lsquo;C&rsquo; and &lsquo;L&rsquo;; pay me a passing compliment on
      the first article in the <i>Debats</i>, and end by averring that Nathan&rsquo;s
      work is the great book of the epoch; which is all as if you said nothing
      at all; they say the same of everything that comes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; continued Blondet, &ldquo;you will have made four hundred francs in a
      week, to say nothing of the pleasure of now and again saying what you
      really think. A discerning public will maintain that either C or L or
      Rubempre is in the right of it, or mayhap all the three. Mythology, beyond
      doubt one of the grandest inventions of the human brain, places Truth at
      the bottom of a well; and what are we to do without buckets? You will have
      supplied the public with three for one. There you are, my boy, Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s head was swimming with bewilderment. Blondet kissed him on both
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to my shop,&rdquo; said he. And every man likewise departed to his
      shop. For these &ldquo;<i>hommes forts</i>,&rdquo; a newspaper office was nothing but
      a shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to meet again in the evening at the Wooden Galleries, and Lucien
      would sign his treaty of peace with Dauriat. Florine and Lousteau, Lucien
      and Coralie, Blondet and Finot, were to dine at the Palais-Royal; du Bruel
      was giving the manager of the Panorama-Dramatique a dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are right,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien, when he was alone with Coralie. &ldquo;Men
      are made to be tools in the hands of stronger spirits. Four hundred francs
      for three articles! Doguereau would scarcely give me as much for a book
      which cost me two years of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write criticism,&rdquo; said Coralie, &ldquo;have a good time! Look at me, I am an
      Andalusian girl to-night, to-morrow I may be a gypsy, and a man the night
      after. Do as I do, give them grimaces for their money, and let us live
      happily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, smitten with love of Paradox, set himself to mount and ride that
      unruly hybrid product of Pegasus and Balaam&rsquo;s ass; started out at a gallop
      over the fields of thought while he took a turn in the Bois, and
      discovered new possibilities in Blondet&rsquo;s outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dined as happy people dine, and signed away all his rights in the <i>Marguerites</i>.
      It never occurred to him that any trouble might arise from that
      transaction in the future. He took a turn of work at the office, wrote off
      a couple of columns, and came back to the Rue de Vendome. Next morning he
      found the germs of yesterday&rsquo;s ideas had sprung up and developed in his
      brain, as ideas develop while the intellect is yet unjaded and the sap is
      rising; and thoroughly did he enjoy the projection of this new article. He
      threw himself into it with enthusiasm. At the summons of the spirit of
      contradiction, new charms met beneath his pen. He was witty and satirical,
      he rose to yet new views of sentiment, of ideas and imagery in literature.
      With subtle ingenuity, he went back to his own first impressions of
      Nathan&rsquo;s work, when he read it in the newsroom of the Cour du Commerce;
      and the ruthless, bloodthirsty critic, the lively mocker, became a poet in
      the final phrases which rose and fell with majestic rhythm like the
      swaying censer before the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred francs, Coralie!&rdquo; cried he, holding up eight sheets of paper
      covered with writing while she dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mood was upon him; he went on to indite, stroke by stroke, the
      promised terrible article on Chatelet and Mme. de Bargeton. That morning
      he experienced one of the keenest personal pleasures of journalism; he
      knew what it was to forge the epigram, to whet and polish the cold blade
      to be sheathed in a victim&rsquo;s heart, to make of the hilt a cunning piece of
      workmanship for the reader to admire. For the public admires the handle,
      the delicate work of the brain, while the cruelty is not apparent; how
      should the public know that the steel of the epigram, tempered in the fire
      of revenge, has been plunged deftly, to rankle in the very quick of a
      victim&rsquo;s vanity, and is reeking from wounds innumerable which it has
      inflicted? It is a hideous joy, that grim, solitary pleasure, relished
      without witnesses; it is like a duel with an absent enemy, slain at a
      distance by a quill; a journalist might really possess the magical power
      of talismans in Eastern tales. Epigram is distilled rancor, the
      quintessence of a hate derived from all the worst passions of man, even as
      love concentrates all that is best in human nature. The man does not exist
      who cannot be witty to avenge himself; and, by the same rule, there is not
      one to whom love does not bring delight. Cheap and easy as this kind of
      wit may be in France, it is always relished. Lucien&rsquo;s article was destined
      to raise the previous reputation of the paper for venomous spite and
      evil-speaking. His article probed two hearts to the depths; it dealt a
      grievous wound to Mme. de Bargeton, his Laura of old days, as well as to
      his rival, the Baron du Chatelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us go for a drive in the Bois,&rdquo; said Coralie, &ldquo;the horses are
      fidgeting. There is no need to kill yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take the article on Nathan to Hector. Journalism is really very
      much like Achilles&rsquo; lance, it salves the wounds that it makes,&rdquo; said
      Lucien, correcting a phrase here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovers started forth in splendor to show themselves to the Paris which
      had but lately given Lucien the cold shoulder, and now was beginning to
      talk about him. To have Paris talking of you! and this after you have
      learned how large the great city is, how hard it is to be anybody there&mdash;it
      was this thought that turned Lucien&rsquo;s head with exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go by way of your tailor&rsquo;s, dear boy, and tell him to be quick
      with your clothes, or try them on if they are ready. If you are going to
      your fine ladies&rsquo; houses, you shall eclipse that monster of a de Marsay
      and young Rastignac and any Ajuda-Pinto or Maxime de Trailles or
      Vandenesse of them all. Remember that your mistress is Coralie! But you
      will not play me any tricks, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards, on the eve of the supper-party at Coralie&rsquo;s house,
      there was a new play at the Ambigu, and it fell to Lucien to write the
      dramatic criticism. Lucien and Coralie walked together after dinner from
      the Rue de Vendome to the Panorama-Dramatique, going along the Cafe Turc
      side of the Boulevard du Temple, a lounge much frequented at that time.
      People wondered at his luck, and praised Coralie&rsquo;s beauty. Chance remarks
      reached his ears; some said that Coralie was the finest woman in Paris,
      others that Lucien was a match for her. The romantic youth felt that he
      was in his atmosphere. This was the life for him. The brotherhood was so
      far away that it was almost out of sight. Only two months ago, how he had
      looked up to those lofty great natures; now he asked himself if they were
      not just a trifle ridiculous with their notions and their Puritanism.
      Coralie&rsquo;s careless words had lodged in Lucien&rsquo;s mind, and begun already to
      bear fruit. He took Coralie to her dressing-room, and strolled about like
      a sultan behind the scenes; the actresses gave him burning glances and
      flattering speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to the Ambigu and attend to business,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Ambigu the house was full; there was not a seat left for him.
      Indignant complaints behind the scenes brought no redress; the box-office
      keeper, who did not know him as yet, said that they had sent orders for
      two boxes to his paper, and sent him about his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall speak of the play as I find it,&rdquo; said Lucien, nettled at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dunce you are!&rdquo; said the leading lady, addressing the box-office
      keeper, &ldquo;that is Coralie&rsquo;s adorer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The box-office keeper turned round immediately at this. &ldquo;I will speak to
      the manager at once, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these small details Lucien saw the immense power wielded by the
      press. His vanity was gratified. The manager appeared to say that the Duc
      de Rhetore and Tullia the opera-dancer were in the stage-box, and they had
      consented to allow Lucien to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have driven two people to distraction,&rdquo; remarked the young Duke,
      mentioning the names of the Baron du Chatelet and Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distraction? What will it be to-morrow?&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;So far, my friends
      have been mere skirmishers, but I have given them red-hot shot to-night.
      To-morrow you will know why we are making game of &lsquo;Potelet.&rsquo; The article
      is called &lsquo;Potelet from 1811 to 1821.&rsquo; Chatelet will be a byword, a name
      for the type of courtiers who deny their benefactor and rally to the
      Bourbons. When I have done with him, I am going to Mme. de Montcornet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s talk was sparkling. He was eager that this great personage should
      see how gross a mistake Mesdames d&rsquo;Espard and de Bargeton had made when
      they slighted Lucien de Rubempre. But he showed the tip of his ear when he
      asserted his right to bear the name of Rubempre, the Duc de Rhetore having
      purposely addressed him as Chardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should go over to the Royalists,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;You have proved
      yourself a man of ability; now show your good sense. The one way of
      obtaining a patent of nobility and the right to bear the title of your
      mother&rsquo;s family, is by asking for it in return for services to be rendered
      to the Court. The Liberals will never make a count of you. The Restoration
      will get the better of the press, you see, in the long run, and the press
      is the only formidable power. They have borne with it too long as it is;
      the press is sure to be muzzled. Take advantage of the last moments of
      liberty to make yourself formidable, and you will have everything&mdash;intellect,
      nobility, and good looks; nothing will be out of your reach. So if you are
      a Liberal, let it be simply for the moment, so that you can make a better
      bargain for your Royalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the Duke entreated Lucien to accept an invitation to dinner,
      which the German Minister (of Florine&rsquo;s supper-party) was about to send.
      Lucien fell under the charm of the noble peer&rsquo;s arguments; the salons from
      which he had been exiled for ever, as he thought, but a few months ago,
      would shortly open their doors for him! He was delighted. He marveled at
      the power of the press; Intellect and the Press, these then were the real
      powers in society. Another thought shaped itself in his mind&mdash;Was
      Etienne Lousteau sorry that he had opened the gate of the temple to a
      newcomer? Even now he (Lucien) felt on his own account that it was
      strongly advisable to put difficulties in the way of eager and ambitious
      recruits from the provinces. If a poet should come to him as he had flung
      himself into Etienne&rsquo;s arms, he dared not think of the reception that he
      would give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful Duke meanwhile saw that Lucien was deep in thought, and made
      a pretty good guess at the matter of his meditations. He himself had
      opened out wide horizons of public life before an ambitious poet, with a
      vacillating will, it is true, but not without aspirations; and the
      journalists had already shown the neophyte, from a pinnacle of the temple,
      all the kingdoms of the world of letters and its riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien himself had no suspicion of a little plot that was being woven, nor
      did he imagine that M. de Rhetore had a hand in it. M. de Rhetore had
      spoken of Lucien&rsquo;s cleverness, and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s set had taken alarm.
      Mme. de Bargeton had commissioned the Duke to sound Lucien, and with that
      object in view, the noble youth had come to the Ambigu-Comique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not believe in stories of elaborate treachery. Neither the great world
      nor the world of journalists laid any deep schemes; definite plans are not
      made by either; their Machiavelism lives from hand to mouth, so to speak,
      and consists, for the most part, in being always on the spot, always on
      the alert to turn everything to account, always on the watch for the
      moment when a man&rsquo;s ruling passion shall deliver him into the hands of his
      enemies. The young Duke had seen through Lucien at Florine&rsquo;s supper-party;
      he had just touched his vain susceptibilities; and now he was trying his
      first efforts in diplomacy upon the living subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien hurried to the Rue Saint-Fiacre after the play to write his
      article. It was a piece of savage and bitter criticism, written in pure
      wantonness; he was amusing himself by trying his power. The melodrama, as
      a matter of fact, was a better piece than the <i>Alcalde</i>; but Lucien
      wished to see whether he could damn a good play and send everybody to see
      a bad one, as his associates had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unfolded the sheet at breakfast next morning, telling Coralie as he did
      so that he had cut up the Ambigu-Comique; and not a little astonished was
      he to find below his paper on Mme. de Bargeton and Chatelet a notice of
      the Ambigu, so mellowed and softened in the course of the night, that
      although the witty analysis was still preserved, the judgment was
      favorable. The article was more likely to fill the house than to empty it.
      No words can describe his wrath. He determined to have a word or two with
      Lousteau. He had already begun to think himself an indispensable man, and
      he vowed that he would not submit to be tyrannized over and treated like a
      fool. To establish his power beyond cavil, he wrote the article for
      Dauriat&rsquo;s review, summing up and weighing all the various opinions
      concerning Nathan&rsquo;s book; and while he was in the humor, he hit off
      another of his short sketches for Lousteau&rsquo;s newspaper. Inexperienced
      journalists, in the first effervescence of youth, make a labor of love of
      ephemeral work, and lavish their best thought unthriftily thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the Panorama-Dramatique gave a first performance of a
      vaudeville that night, so that Florine and Coralie might be free for the
      evening. There were to be cards before supper. Lousteau came for the short
      notice of the vaudeville; it had been written beforehand after the general
      rehearsal, for Etienne wished to have the paper off his mind. Lucien read
      over one of the charming sketches of Parisian whimsicalities which made
      the fortune of the paper, and Lousteau kissed him on both eyelids, and
      called him the providence of journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you amuse yourself by turning my article inside out?&rdquo; asked
      Lucien. He had written his brilliant sketch simply and solely to give
      emphasis to his grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>?&rdquo; exclaimed Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who else can have altered my article?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know all the ins and outs yet, dear fellow. The Ambigu pays
      for thirty copies, and only takes nine for the manager and box
      office-keeper and their mistresses, and for the three lessees of the
      theatre. Every one of the Boulevard theatres pays eight hundred francs in
      this way to the paper; and there is quite as much again in boxes and
      orders for Finot, to say nothing of the contributions of the company. And
      if the minor theatres do this, you may imagine what the big ones do! Now
      you understand? We are bound to show a good deal of indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand this, that I am not at liberty to write as I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what does that matter, so long as you turn an honest penny?&rdquo; cried
      Lousteau. &ldquo;Besides, my boy, what grudge had you against the theatre? You
      must have had some reason for it, or you would not have cut up the play as
      you did. If you slash for the sake of slashing, the paper will get into
      trouble, and when there is good reason for hitting hard it will not tell.
      Did the manager leave you out in the cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had not kept a place for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;I shall let him see your article, and tell him
      that I softened it down; you will find it serves you better than if it had
      appeared in print. Go and ask him for tickets to-morrow, and he will sign
      forty blank orders every month. I know a man who can get rid of them for
      you; I will introduce you to him, and he will buy them all up at
      half-price. There is a trade done in theatre tickets, just as Barbet
      trades in reviewers&rsquo; copies. This is another Barbet, the leader of the <i>claque</i>.
      He lives near by; come and see him, there is time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, it is a scandalous thing that Finot should levy
      blackmail in matters intellectual. Sooner or later&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried Lousteau, &ldquo;where do you come from? For what do you take
      Finot? Beneath his pretence of good-nature, his ignorance and stupidity,
      and those Turcaret&rsquo;s airs of his, there is all the cunning of his father
      the hatter. Did you notice an old soldier of the Empire in the den at the
      office? That is Finot&rsquo;s uncle. The uncle is not only one of the right
      sort, he has the luck to be taken for a fool; and he takes all that kind
      of business upon his shoulders. An ambitious man in Paris is well off
      indeed if he has a willing scapegoat at hand. In public life, as in
      journalism, there are hosts of emergencies in which the chiefs cannot
      afford to appear. If Finot should enter on a political career, his uncle
      would be his secretary, and receive all the contributions levied in his
      department on big affairs. Anybody would take Giroudeau for a fool at
      first sight, but he has just enough shrewdness to be an inscrutable old
      file. He is on picket duty; he sees that we are not pestered with hubbub,
      beginners wanting a job, or advertisements. No other paper has his equal,
      I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He plays his part well,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;I saw him at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne and Lucien reached a handsome house in the Rue du
      Faubourg-du-Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is M. Braulard in?&rdquo; Etienne asked of the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Monsieur</i>?&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;Then, is the leader of the <i>claque</i>
      &lsquo;Monsieur&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, Braulard has twenty thousand francs of income. All the
      dramatic authors of the Boulevards are in his clutches, and have a
      standing account with him as if he were a banker. Orders and complimentary
      tickets are sold here. Braulard knows where to get rid of such
      merchandise. Now for a turn at statistics, a useful science enough in its
      way. At the rate of fifty complimentary tickets every evening for each
      theatre, you have two hundred and fifty tickets daily. Suppose, taking one
      with another, that they are worth a couple of francs apiece, Braulard pays
      a hundred and twenty-five francs daily for them, and takes his chance of
      making cent per cent. In this way authors&rsquo; tickets alone bring him in
      about four thousand francs every month, or forty-eight thousand francs per
      annum. Allow twenty thousand francs for loss, for he cannot always place
      all his tickets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the people who pay at the door go in with the holders of
      complimentary tickets for unreserved seats, and the theatre reserves the
      right of admitting those who pay. There are fine warm evenings to be
      reckoned with besides, and poor plays. Braulard makes, perhaps, thirty
      thousand francs every year in this way, and he has his <i>claqueurs</i>
      besides, another industry. Florine and Coralie pay tribute to him; if they
      did not, there would be no applause when they come on or go off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau gave this explanation in a low voice as they went up the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris is a queer place,&rdquo; said Lucien; it seemed to him that he saw
      self-interest squatting in every corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart maid-servant opened the door. At the sight of Etienne Lousteau,
      the dealer in orders and tickets rose from a sturdy chair before a large
      cylinder desk, and Lucien beheld the leader of the <i>claque</i>, Braulard
      himself, dressed in a gray molleton jacket, footed trousers, and red
      slippers; for all the world like a doctor or a solicitor. He was a typical
      self-made man, Lucien thought&mdash;a vulgar-looking face with a pair of
      exceedingly cunning gray eyes, hands made for hired applause, a complexion
      over which hard living had passed like rain over a roof, grizzled hair,
      and a somewhat husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come from Mlle. Florine, no doubt, sir, and this gentleman for
      Mlle. Coralie,&rdquo; said Braulard; &ldquo;I know you very well by sight. Don&rsquo;t
      trouble yourself, sir,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Lucien; &ldquo;I am buying the
      Gymnase connection, I will look after your lady, and I will give her
      notice of any tricks they may try to play on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not an offer to be refused, my dear Braulard, but we have come
      about the press orders for the Boulevard theatres&mdash;I as editor, and
      this gentleman as dramatic critic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;ah, yes! Finot has sold his paper. I heard about it. He is
      getting on, is Finot. I have asked him to dine with me at the end of the
      week; if you will do me the honor and pleasure of coming, you may bring
      your ladies, and there will be a grand jollification. Adele Dupuis is
      coming, and Ducange, and Frederic du Petit-Mere, and Mlle. Millot, my
      mistress. We shall have good fun and better liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ducange must be in difficulties. He has lost his lawsuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lent him ten thousand francs; if <i>Calas</i> succeeds, it will
      repay the loan, so I have been organizing a success. Ducange is a clever
      man; he has brains&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien fancied that he must be dreaming when he heard a <i>claqueur</i>
      appraising a writer&rsquo;s value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie has improved,&rdquo; continued Braulard, with the air of a competent
      critic. &ldquo;If she is a good girl, I will take her part, for they have got up
      a cabal against her at the Gymnase. This is how I mean to do it. I will
      have a few well-dressed men in the balconies to smile and make a little
      murmur, and the applause will follow. That is a dodge which makes a
      position for an actress. I have a liking for Coralie, and you ought to be
      satisfied, for she has feeling. Aha! I can hiss any one on the stage if I
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let us settle this business about the tickets,&rdquo; put in Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will come to this gentleman&rsquo;s lodging for them at the
      beginning of the month. He is a friend of yours, and I will treat him as I
      do you. You have five theatres; you will get thirty tickets&mdash;that
      will be something like seventy-five francs a month. Perhaps you will be
      wanting an advance?&rdquo; added Braulard, lifting a cash-box full of coin out
      of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;we will keep that shift against a rainy day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will work with Coralie, sir, and we will come to an understanding,&rdquo;
       said Braulard, addressing Lucien, who was looking about him, not without
      profound astonishment. There was a bookcase in Braulard&rsquo;s study, there
      were framed engravings and good furniture; and as they passed through the
      drawing room, he noticed that the fittings were neither too luxurious nor
      yet mean. The dining-room seemed to be the best ordered room, he remarked
      on this jokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Braulard is an epicure,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;his dinners are famous in
      dramatic literature, and they are what you might expect from his
      cash-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have good wine,&rdquo; Braulard replied modestly.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! here are my
      lamplighters,&rdquo; he added, as a sound of hoarse voices and strange footsteps
      came up from the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien on his way down saw a march past of <i>claqueurs</i> and retailers
      of tickets. It was an ill smelling squad, attired in caps, seedy trousers,
      and threadbare overcoats; a flock of gallows-birds with bluish and
      greenish tints in their faces, neglected beards, and a strange mixture of
      savagery and subservience in their eyes. A horrible population lives and
      swarms upon the Paris boulevards; selling watch guards and brass jewelry
      in the streets by day, applauding under the chandeliers of the theatre at
      night, and ready to lend themselves to any dirty business in the great
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the Romans!&rdquo; laughed Lousteau; &ldquo;behold fame incarnate for
      actresses and dramatic authors. It is no prettier than our own when you
      come to look at it close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to keep illusions on any subject in Paris,&rdquo; answered
      Lucien as they turned in at his door. &ldquo;There is a tax upon everything&mdash;everything
      has its price, and anything can be made to order&mdash;even success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thirty guests were assembled that evening in Coralie&rsquo;s rooms, her dining
      room would not hold more. Lucien had asked Dauriat and the manager of the
      Panorama-Dramatique, Matifat and Florine, Camusot, Lousteau, Finot,
      Nathan, Hector Merlin and Mme. du Val-Noble, Felicien Vernou, Blondet,
      Vignon, Philippe Bridau, Mariette, Giroudeau, Cardot and Florentine, and
      Bixiou. He had also asked all his friends of the Rue des Quatre-Vents.
      Tullia the dancer, who was not unkind, said gossip, to du Bruel, had come
      without her duke. The proprietors of the newspapers, for whom most of the
      journalists wrote, were also of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock, when the lights of the candles in the chandeliers shone
      over the furniture, the hangings, and the flowers, the rooms wore the
      festal air that gives to Parisian luxury the appearance of a dream; and
      Lucien felt indefinable stirrings of hope and gratified vanity and
      pleasure at the thought that he was the master of the house. But how and
      by whom the magic wand had been waved he no longer sought to remember.
      Florine and Coralie, dressed with the fanciful extravagance and
      magnificent artistic effect of the stage, smiled on the poet like two
      fairies at the gates of the Palace of Dreams. And Lucien was almost in a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life had been changed so suddenly during the last few months; he had
      gone so swiftly from the depths of penury to the last extreme of luxury,
      that at moments he felt as uncomfortable as a dreaming man who knows that
      he is asleep. And yet, he looked round at the fair reality about him with
      a confidence to which envious minds might have given the name of fatuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien himself had changed. He had grown paler during these days of
      continual enjoyment; languor had lent a humid look to his eyes; in short,
      to use Mme. d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s expression, he looked like a man who is loved. He
      was the handsomer for it. Consciousness of his powers and his strength was
      visible in his face, enlightened as it was by love and experience. Looking
      out over the world of letters and of men, it seemed to him that he might
      go to and fro as lord of it all. Sober reflection never entered his
      romantic head unless it was driven in by the pressure of adversity, and
      just now the present held not a care for him. The breath of praise swelled
      the sails of his skiff; all the instruments of success lay there to his
      hand; he had an establishment, a mistress whom all Paris envied him, a
      carriage, and untold wealth in his inkstand. Heart and soul and brain were
      alike transformed within him; why should he care to be over nice about the
      means, when the great results were visibly there before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such a style of living will seem, and with good reason, to be anything
      but secure to economists who have any experience of Paris, it will not be
      superfluous to give a glance to the foundation, uncertain as it was, upon
      which the prosperity of the pair was based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camusot had given Coralie&rsquo;s tradesmen instructions to grant her credit for
      three months at least, and this had been done without her knowledge.
      During those three months, therefore, horses and servants, like everything
      else, waited as if by enchantment at the bidding of two children, eager
      for enjoyment, and enjoying to their hearts&rsquo; content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie had taken Lucien&rsquo;s hand and given him a glimpse of the
      transformation scene in the dining-room, of the splendidly appointed
      table, of chandeliers, each fitted with forty wax-lights, of the royally
      luxurious dessert, and a menu of Chevet&rsquo;s. Lucien kissed her on the
      forehead and held her closely to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall succeed, child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then I will repay you for such
      love and devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Coralie. &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very hard to please if I were not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, that smile of yours pays for everything,&rdquo; she said, and
      with a serpentine movement she raised her head and laid her lips against
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they went back to the others, Florine, Lousteau, Matifat, and Camusot
      were setting out the card-tables. Lucien&rsquo;s friends began to arrive, for
      already these folk began to call themselves &ldquo;Lucien&rsquo;s friends&rdquo;; and they
      sat over the cards from nine o&rsquo;clock till midnight. Lucien was
      unacquainted with a single game, but Lousteau lost a thousand francs, and
      Lucien could not refuse to lend him the money when he asked for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel, Fulgence, and Joseph appeared about ten o&rsquo;clock; and Lucien,
      chatting with them in a corner, saw that they looked sober and serious
      enough, not to say ill at ease. D&rsquo;Arthez could not come, he was finishing
      his book; Leon Giraud was busy with the first number of his review; so the
      brotherhood had sent three artists among their number, thinking that they
      would feel less out of their element in an uproarious supper party than
      the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellows,&rdquo; said Lucien, assuming a slightly patronizing
      tone, &ldquo;the &lsquo;comical fellow&rsquo; may become a great public character yet, you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I may be mistaken; I don&rsquo;t ask better,&rdquo; said Michel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you living with Coralie until you can do better?&rdquo; asked Fulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucien, trying to look unconscious. &ldquo;Coralie had an elderly
      adorer, a merchant, and she showed him the door, poor fellow. I am better
      off than your brother Philippe,&rdquo; he added, addressing Joseph Bridau; &ldquo;he
      does not know how to manage Mariette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man like another now; in short, you will make your way,&rdquo; said
      Fulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man that will always be the same for you, under all circumstances,&rdquo;
       returned Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel and Fulgence exchanged incredulous scornful smiles at this. Lucien
      saw the absurdity of his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie is wonderfully beautiful,&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph Bridau. &ldquo;What a
      magnificent portrait she would make!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful and good,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;she is an angel, upon my word. And you
      shall paint her portrait; she shall sit to you if you like for your
      Venetian lady brought by the old woman to the senator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All women who love are angelic,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment Raoul Nathan flew upon Lucien, and grasped both his
      hands and shook them in a sudden access of violent friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good friend, you are something more than a great man, you have a
      heart,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;a much rarer thing than genius in these days. You are a
      devoted friend. I am yours, in short, through thick and thin; I shall
      never forget all that you have done for me this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s joy had reached the highest point; to be thus caressed by a man
      of whom everyone was talking! He looked at his three friends of the
      brotherhood with something like a superior air. Nathan&rsquo;s appearance upon
      the scene was the result of an overture from Merlin, who sent him a proof
      of the favorable review to appear in to-morrow&rsquo;s issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only consented to write the attack on condition that I should be
      allowed to reply to it myself,&rdquo; Lucien said in Nathan&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I am one of
      you.&rdquo; This incident was opportune; it justified the remark which amused
      Fulgence. Lucien was radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s book comes out,&rdquo; he said, turning to the three, &ldquo;I am in
      a position to be useful to him. That thought in itself would induce me to
      remain a journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you do as you like?&rdquo; Michel asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as one can when one is indispensable,&rdquo; said Lucien modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost midnight when they sat down to supper, and the fun grew fast
      and furious. Talk was less restrained in Lucien&rsquo;s house than at Matifat&rsquo;s,
      for no one suspected that the representatives of the brotherhood and the
      newspaper writers held divergent opinions. Young intellects, depraved by
      arguing for either side, now came into conflict with each other, and
      fearful axioms of the journalistic jurisprudence, then in its infancy,
      hurtled to and fro. Claude Vignon, upholding the dignity of criticism,
      inveighed against the tendency of the smaller newspapers, saying that the
      writers of personalities lowered themselves in the end. Lousteau, Merlin,
      and Finot took up the cudgels for the system known by the name of <i>blague</i>;
      puffery, gossip, and humbug, said they, was the test of talent, and set
      the hall-mark, as it were, upon it. &ldquo;Any man who can stand that test has
      real power,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; cried Merlin, &ldquo;when a great man receives ovations, there ought
      to be a chorus in insults to balance, as in a Roman triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; put in Lucien; &ldquo;then every one held up to ridicule in print will
      fancy that he has made a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one would think that the question interested you,&rdquo; exclaimed Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about our sonnets,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien; &ldquo;is that the way they
      will win us the fame of a second Petrarch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura already counts for something in his fame,&rdquo; said Dauriat, a pun
      [Laure (l&rsquo;or)] received with acclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Faciamus experimentum in anima vili</i>,&rdquo; retorted Lucien with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And woe unto him whom reviewers shall spare, flinging him crowns at his
      first appearance, for he shall be shelved like the saints in their
      shrines, and no man shall pay him the slightest attention,&rdquo; said Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People will say, &lsquo;Look elsewhere, simpleton; you have had your due
      already,&rsquo; as Champcenetz said to the Marquis de Genlis, who was looking
      too fondly at his wife,&rdquo; added Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success is the ruin of a man in France,&rdquo; said Finot. &ldquo;We are so jealous
      of one another that we try to forget, and to make others forget, the
      triumphs of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contradiction is the life of literature, in fact,&rdquo; said Claude Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In art as in nature, there are two principles everywhere at strife,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Fulgence; &ldquo;and victory for either means death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is with politics,&rdquo; added Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a case in point,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Dauriat will sell a couple of
      thousand copies of Nathan&rsquo;s book in the coming week. And why? Because the
      book that was cleverly attacked will be ably defended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merlin took up the proof of to-morrow&rsquo;s paper. &ldquo;How can such an article
      fail to sell an edition?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the article,&rdquo; said Dauriat. &ldquo;I am a publisher wherever I am, even at
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merlin read Lucien&rsquo;s triumphant refutation aloud, and the whole party
      applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could that article have been written unless the attack had preceded
      it?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat drew the proof of the third article from his pocket and read it
      over, Finot listening closely; for it was to appear in the second number
      of his own review, and as editor he exaggerated his enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so and not otherwise would Bossuet have written if
      he had lived in our day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; said Merlin. &ldquo;Bossuet would have been a journalist
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Bossuet the Second!&rdquo; cried Claude Vignon, raising his glass with an
      ironical bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my Christopher Columbus!&rdquo; returned Lucien, drinking a health to
      Dauriat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a nickname?&rdquo; Merlin inquired, looking maliciously from Finot to
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on at this pace, you will be quite beyond us,&rdquo; said Dauriat;
      &ldquo;these gentlemen&rdquo; (indicating Camusot and Matifat) &ldquo;cannot follow you as
      it is. A joke is like a bit of thread; if it is spun too fine, it breaks,
      as Bonaparte said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;we have been eye-witnesses of a strange,
      portentous, unheard-of, and truly surprising phenomenon. Admire the
      rapidity with which our friend here has been transformed from a provincial
      into a journalist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a born journalist,&rdquo; said Dauriat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children!&rdquo; called Finot, rising to his feet, &ldquo;all of us here present have
      encouraged and protected our amphitryon in his entrance upon a career in
      which he has already surpassed our hopes. In two months he has shown us
      what he can do in a series of excellent articles known to us all. I
      propose to baptize him in form as a journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crown of roses! to signalize a double conquest,&rdquo; cried Bixiou, glancing
      at Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie made a sign to Berenice. That portly handmaid went to Coralie&rsquo;s
      dressing-room and brought back a box of tumbled artificial flowers. The
      more incapable members of the party were grotesquely tricked out in these
      blossoms, and a crown of roses was soon woven. Finot, as high priest,
      sprinkled a few drops of champagne on Lucien&rsquo;s golden curls, pronouncing
      with delicious gravity the words&mdash;&ldquo;In the name of the Government
      Stamp, the Caution-money, and the Fine, I baptize thee, Journalist. May
      thy articles sit lightly on thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may they be paid for, including white lines!&rdquo; cried Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment Lucien caught sight of three melancholy faces. Michel
      Chrestien, Joseph Bridau, and Fulgence Ridal took up their hats and went
      out amid a storm of invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer customers!&rdquo; said Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fulgence used to be a good fellow,&rdquo; added Lousteau, &ldquo;before they
      perverted his morals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Claude Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some very serious young men,&rdquo; said Blondet, &ldquo;who meet at a
      philosophico-religious symposium in the Rue des Quatre-Vents, and worry
      themselves about the meaning of human life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are trying to find out whether it goes round in a circle, or makes
      some progress,&rdquo; continued Blondet. &ldquo;They were very hard put to it between
      the straight line and the curve; the triangle, warranted by Scripture,
      seemed to them to be nonsense, when, lo! there arose among them some
      prophet or other who declared for the spiral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men might meet to invent more dangerous nonsense than that!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Lucien, making a faint attempt to champion the brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take theories of that sort for idle words,&rdquo; said Felicien Vernou;
      &ldquo;but a time comes when the arguments take the form of gunshot and the
      guillotine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have not come to that yet,&rdquo; said Bixiou; &ldquo;they have only come as far
      as the designs of Providence in the invention of champagne, the
      humanitarian significance of breeches, and the blind deity who keeps the
      world going. They pick up fallen great men like Vico, Saint-Simon, and
      Fourier. I am much afraid that they will turn poor Joseph Bridau&rsquo;s head
      among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bianchon, my old schoolfellow, gives me the cold shoulder now,&rdquo; said
      Lousteau; &ldquo;it is all their doing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they give lectures on orthopedy and intellectual gymnastics?&rdquo; asked
      Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Finot, &ldquo;if Bianchon has any hand in their
      theories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;he will be a great physician anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t d&rsquo;Arthez their visible head?&rdquo; asked Nathan, &ldquo;a little youngster
      that is going to swallow all of us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a genius!&rdquo; cried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Genius, is he! Well, give me a glass of sherry!&rdquo; said Claude Vignon,
      smiling.

      Every one, thereupon, began to explain his character for the benefit of
      his neighbor; and when a clever man feels a pressing need of explaining
      himself, and of unlocking his heart, it is pretty clear that wine has got
      the upper hand. An hour later, all the men in the company were the best
      friends in the world, addressing each other as great men and bold spirits,
      who held the future in their hands. Lucien, in his quality of host, was
      sufficiently clearheaded to apprehend the meaning of the sophistries which
      impressed him and completed his demoralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Liberal party,&rdquo; announced Finot, &ldquo;is compelled to stir up discussion
      somehow. There is no fault to find with the action of the Government, and
      you may imagine what a fix the Opposition is in. Which of you now cares to
      write a pamphlet in favor of the system of primogeniture, and raise a cry
      against the secret designs of the Court? The pamphlet will be paid for
      handsomely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write it,&rdquo; said Hector Merlin. &ldquo;It is my own point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your party will complain that you are compromising them,&rdquo; said Finot.
      &ldquo;Felicien, you must undertake it; Dauriat will bring it out, and we will
      keep the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much shall I get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six hundred francs. Sign it &lsquo;Le Comte C, three stars.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Felicien Vernou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are introducing the <i>canard</i> to the political world,&rdquo;
       remarked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply the Chabot affair carried into the region of abstract
      ideas,&rdquo; said Finot. &ldquo;Fasten intentions on the Government, and then let
      loose public opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How a Government can leave the control of ideas to such a pack of scamps
      as we are, is matter for perpetual and profound astonishment to me,&rdquo; said
      Claude Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Ministry blunders so far as to come down into the arena, we can
      give them a drubbing. If they are nettled by it, the thing will rankle in
      people&rsquo;s minds, and the Government will lose its hold on the masses. The
      newspaper risks nothing, and the authorities have everything to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;France will be a cipher until newspapers are abolished by law,&rdquo; said
      Claude Vignon. &ldquo;You are making progress hourly,&rdquo; he added, addressing
      Finot. &ldquo;You are a modern order of Jesuits, lacking the creed, the fixed
      idea, the discipline, and the union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the card-tables; and before long the light of the
      candles grew feeble in the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucien, your friends from the Rue des Quatre-Vents looked as dismal as
      criminals going to be hanged,&rdquo; said Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were the judges, not the criminals,&rdquo; replied the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judges are more amusing than <i>that</i>,&rdquo; said Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a month Lucien&rsquo;s whole time was taken up with supper parties, dinner
      engagements, breakfasts, and evening parties; he was swept away by an
      irresistible current into a vortex of dissipation and easy work. He no
      longer thought of the future. The power of calculation amid the
      complications of life is the sign of a strong will which poets, weaklings,
      and men who live a purely intellectual life can never counterfeit. Lucien
      was living from hand to mouth, spending his money as fast as he made it,
      like many another journalist; nor did he give so much as a thought to
      those periodically recurrent days of reckoning which chequer the life of
      the bohemian in Paris so sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dress and figure he was a rival for the great dandies of the day.
      Coralie, like all zealots, loved to adorn her idol. She ruined herself to
      give her beloved poet the accoutrements which had so stirred his envy in
      the Garden of the Tuileries. Lucien had wonderful canes, and a charming
      eyeglass; he had diamond studs, and scarf-rings, and signet-rings, besides
      an assortment of waistcoats marvelous to behold, and in sufficient number
      to match every color in a variety of costumes. His transition to the
      estate of dandy swiftly followed. When he went to the German Minister&rsquo;s
      dinner, all the young men regarded him with suppressed envy; yet de
      Marsay, Vandenesse, Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de Trailles, Rastignac,
      Beaudenord, Manerville, and the Duc de Maufrigneuse gave place to none in
      the kingdom of fashion. Men of fashion are as jealous among themselves as
      women, and in the same way. Lucien was placed between Mme. de Montcornet
      and Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, in whose honor the dinner was given; both ladies
      overwhelmed him with flatteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you turn your back on society when you would have been so well
      received?&rdquo; asked the Marquise. &ldquo;Every one was prepared to make much of
      you. And I have a quarrel with you too. You owed me a call&mdash;I am
      still waiting to receive it. I saw you at the Opera the other day, and you
      would not deign to come to see me nor to take any notice of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin, madame, so unmistakably dismissed me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you do not know women,&rdquo; the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard broke in upon him. &ldquo;You
      have wounded the most angelic heart, the noblest nature that I know. You
      do not know all that Louise was trying to do for you, nor how tactfully
      she laid her plans for you.&mdash;Oh! and she would have succeeded,&rdquo; the
      Marquise continued, replying to Lucien&rsquo;s mute incredulity. &ldquo;Her husband is
      dead now; died, as he was bound to die, of an indigestion; could you doubt
      that she would be free sooner or later? And can you suppose that she would
      like to be Madame Chardon? It was worth while to take some trouble to gain
      the title of Comtesse de Rubempre. Love, you see, is a great vanity, which
      requires the lesser vanities to be in harmony with itself&mdash;especially
      in marriage. I might love you to madness&mdash;which is to say,
      sufficiently to marry you&mdash;and yet I should find it very unpleasant
      to be called Madame Chardon. You can see that. And now that you understand
      the difficulties of Paris life, you will know how many roundabout ways you
      must take to reach your end; very well, then, you must admit that Louise
      was aspiring to an all but impossible piece of Court favor; she was quite
      unknown, she is not rich, and therefore she could not afford to neglect
      any means of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are clever,&rdquo; the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard continued; &ldquo;but we women, when we
      love, are cleverer than the cleverest man. My cousin tried to make that
      absurd Chatelet useful&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; she broke off, &ldquo;I owe not a little
      amusement to you; your articles on Chatelet made me laugh heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien knew not what to think of all this. Of the treachery and bad faith
      of journalism he had had some experience; but in spite of his
      perspicacity, he scarcely expected to find bad faith or treachery in
      society. There were some sharp lessons in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame,&rdquo; he objected, for her words aroused a lively curiosity, &ldquo;is
      not the Heron under your protection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is obliged to be civil to one&rsquo;s worst enemies in society,&rdquo; protested
      she; &ldquo;one may be bored, but one must look as if the talk was amusing, and
      not seldom one seems to sacrifice friends the better to serve them. Are
      you still a novice? You mean to write, and yet you know nothing of current
      deceit? My cousin apparently sacrificed you to the Heron, but how could
      she dispense with his influence for you? Our friend stands well with the
      present ministry; and we have made him see that your attacks will do him
      service&mdash;up to a certain point, for we want you to make it up again
      some of these days. Chatelet has received compensations for his troubles;
      for, as des Lupeaulx said, &lsquo;While the newspapers are making Chatelet
      ridiculous, they will leave the Ministry in peace.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; the Marquise left Lucien to his own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Blondet led me to hope that I should have the pleasure of seeing you
      in my house,&rdquo; said the Comtesse de Montcornet. &ldquo;You will meet a few
      artists and men of letters, and some one else who has the keenest desire
      to become acquainted with you&mdash;Mlle. des Touches, the owner of
      talents rare among our sex. You will go to her house, no doubt. Mlle. de
      Touches (or Camille Maupin, if you prefer it) is prodigiously rich, and
      presides over one of the most remarkable salons in Paris. She has heard
      that you are as handsome as you are clever, and is dying to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien could only pour out incoherent thanks and glance enviously at Emile
      Blondet. There was as great a difference between a great lady like Mme. de
      Montcornet and Coralie as between Coralie and a girl out of the streets.
      The Countess was young and witty and beautiful, with the very white
      fairness of women of the north. Her mother was the Princess Scherbellof,
      and the Minister before dinner had paid her the most respectful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the Marquise had made an end of trifling disdainfully with
      the wing of a chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Louise felt so much affection for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She took me
      into her confidence; I knew her dreams of a great career for you. She
      would have borne a great deal, but what scorn you showed her when you sent
      back her letters! Cruelty we can forgive; those who hurt us must have
      still some faith in us; but indifference! Indifference is like polar
      snows, it extinguishes all life. So, you must see that you have lost a
      precious affection through your own fault. Why break with her? Even if she
      had scorned you, you had your way to make, had you not?&mdash;your name to
      win back? Louise thought of all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why was she silent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh! mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; cried the Marquise, &ldquo;it was I myself who advised
      her not to take you into her confidence. Between ourselves, you know, you
      seemed so little used to the ways of the world, that I took alarm. I was
      afraid that your inexperience and rash ardor might wreck our
      carefully-made schemes. Can you recollect yourself as you were then? You
      must admit that if you could see your double to-day, you would say the
      same yourself. You are not like the same man. That was our mistake. But
      would one man in a thousand combine such intellectual gifts with such
      wonderful aptitude for taking the tone of society? I did not think that
      you would be such an astonishing exception. You were transformed so
      quickly, you acquired the manner of Paris so easily, that I did not
      recognize you in the Bois de Boulogne a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien heard the great lady with inexpressible pleasure; the flatteries
      were spoken with such a petulant, childlike, confiding air, and she seemed
      to take such a deep interest in him, that he thought of his first evening
      at the Panorama-Dramatique, and began to fancy that some such miracle was
      about to take place a second time. Everything had smiled upon him since
      that happy evening; his youth, he thought, was the talisman that worked
      this change. He would prove this great lady; she should not take him
      unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, what were these schemes which have turned to chimeras, madame?&rdquo;
       asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise meant to obtain a royal patent permitting you to bear the name and
      title of Rubempre. She wished to put Chardon out of sight. Your opinions
      have put that out of the question now, but <i>then</i> it would not have
      been so hard to manage, and a title would mean a fortune for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will look on these things as trifles and visionary ideas,&rdquo; she
      continued; &ldquo;but we know something of life, and we know, too, all the solid
      advantages of a Count&rsquo;s title when it is borne by a fashionable and
      extremely charming young man. Announce &lsquo;M. Chardon&rsquo; and &lsquo;M. le Comte de
      Rubempre&rsquo; before heiresses or English girls with a million to their
      fortune, and note the difference of the effect. The Count might be in
      debt, but he would find open hearts; his good looks, brought into relief
      by his title, would be like a diamond in a rich setting; M. Chardon would
      not be so much as noticed. WE have not invented these notions; they are
      everywhere in the world, even among the burgeois. You are turning your
      back on fortune at this minute. Do you see that good-looking young man? He
      is the Vicomte Felix de Vandenesse, one of the King&rsquo;s private secretaries.
      The King is fond enough of young men of talent, and Vandenesse came from
      the provinces with baggage nearly as light as yours. You are a thousand
      times cleverer than he; but do you belong to a great family, have you a
      name? You know des Lupeaulx; his name is very much like yours, for he was
      born a Chardin; well, he would not sell his little farm of Lupeaulx for a
      million, he will be Comte des Lupeaulx some day, and perhaps his grandson
      may be a duke.&mdash;You have made a false start; and if you continue in
      that way, it will be all over with you. See how much wiser M. Emile
      Blondet has been! He is engaged on a Government newspaper; he is well
      looked on by those in authority; he can afford to mix with Liberals, for
      he holds sound opinions; and soon or later he will succeed. But then he
      understood how to choose his opinions and his protectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your charming neighbor&rdquo; (Mme. d&rsquo;Espard glanced at Mme. de Montcornet)
      &ldquo;was a Troisville; there are two peers of France in the family and two
      deputies. She made a wealthy marriage with her name; she sees a great deal
      of society at her house; she has influence, she will move the political
      world for young M. Blondet. Where will a Coralie take you? In a few years&rsquo; 
      time you will be hopelessly in debt and weary of pleasure. You have chosen
      badly in love, and you are arranging your life ill. The woman whom you
      delight to wound was at the Opera the other night, and this was how she
      spoke of you. She deplored the way in which you were throwing away your
      talent and the prime of youth; she was thinking of you, and not of
      herself, all the while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if you were only telling me the truth, madame!&rdquo; cried Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What object should I have in telling lies?&rdquo; returned the Marquise, with a
      glance of cold disdain which annihilated him. He was so dashed by it, that
      the conversation dropped, for the Marquise was offended, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was nettled by her silence, but he felt that it was due to his own
      clumsiness, and promised himself that he would repair his error. He turned
      to Mme. de Montcornet and talked to her of Blondet, extolling that young
      writer for her benefit. The Countess was gracious to him, and asked him
      (at a sign from Mme. d&rsquo;Espard) to spend an evening at her house. It was to
      be a small and quiet gathering to which only friends were invited&mdash;Mme.
      de Bargeton would be there in spite of her mourning; Lucien would be
      pleased, she was sure, to meet Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. la Marquise says that all the wrong is on my side,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;so
      surely it rests with her cousin, does it not, to decide whether she will
      meet me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put an end to those ridiculous attacks, which only couple her name with
      the name of a man for whom she does not care at all, and you will soon
      sign a treaty of peace. You thought that she had used you ill, I am told,
      but I myself have seen her in sadness because you had forsaken her. Is it
      true that she left the provinces on your account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien smiled; he did not venture to make any other reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how could you doubt the woman who made such sacrifices for you?
      Beautiful and intellectual as she is, she deserves besides to be loved for
      her own sake; and Mme. de Bargeton cared less for you than for your
      talents. Believe me, women value intellect more than good looks,&rdquo; added
      the Countess, stealing a glance at Emile Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Minister&rsquo;s hotel Lucien could see the differences between the great
      world and that other world beyond the pale in which he had lately been
      living. There was no sort of resemblance between the two kinds of
      splendor, no single point in common. The loftiness and disposition of the
      rooms in one of the handsomest houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the
      ancient gilding, the breadth of decorative style, the subdued richness of
      the accessories, all this was strange and new to him; but Lucien had
      learned very quickly to take luxury for granted, and he showed no
      surprise. His behavior was as far removed from assurance or fatuity on the
      one hand as from complacency and servility upon the other. His manner was
      good; he found favor in the eyes of all who were not prepared to be
      hostile, like the younger men, who resented his sudden intrusion into the
      great world, and felt jealous of his good looks and his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they rose from table, he offered his arm to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, and was
      not refused. Rastignac, watching him, saw that the Marquise was gracious
      to Lucien, and came in the character of a fellow-countryman to remind the
      poet that they had met once before at Mme. du Val-Noble&rsquo;s. The young
      patrician seemed anxious to find an ally in the great man from his own
      province, asked Lucien to breakfast with him some morning, and offered to
      introduce him to some young men of fashion. Lucien was nothing loath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear Blondet is coming,&rdquo; said Rastignac.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were standing near the Marquis de Ronquerolles, the Duc de
      Rhetore, de Marsay, and General Montriveau. The Minister came across to
      join the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, addressing Lucien with a bluff German heartiness that
      concealed his dangerous subtlety; &ldquo;well, so you have made your peace with
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard; she is delighted with you, and we all know,&rdquo; he added,
      looking round the group, &ldquo;how difficult it is to please her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she adores intellect,&rdquo; said Rastignac, &ldquo;and my illustrious
      fellow-countryman has wit enough to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will soon find out that he is not doing well for himself,&rdquo; Blondet put
      in briskly. &ldquo;He will come over; he will soon be one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who stood about Lucien rang the changes on this theme; the older and
      responsible men laid down the law with one or two profound remarks; the
      younger ones made merry at the expense of the Liberals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He simply tossed up head or tails for Right or Left, I am sure,&rdquo; remarked
      Blondet, &ldquo;but now he will choose for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien burst out laughing; he thought of his talk with Lousteau that
      evening in the Luxembourg Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken on a bear-leader,&rdquo; continued Blondet, &ldquo;one Etienne Lousteau,
      a newspaper hack who sees a five-franc piece in a column. Lousteau&rsquo;s
      politics consist in a belief that Napoleon will return, and (and this
      seems to me to be still more simple) in a confidence in the gratitude and
      patriotism of their worships the gentlemen of the Left. As a Rubempre,
      Lucien&rsquo;s sympathies should lean towards the aristocracy; as a journalist,
      he ought to be for authority, or he will never be either Rubempre or a
      secretary-general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Minister now asked Lucien to take a hand at whist; but, to the great
      astonishment of those present, he declared that he did not know the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come early to me on the day of that breakfast affair,&rdquo; Rastignac
      whispered, &ldquo;and I will teach you to play. You are a discredit to the royal
      city of Angouleme; and, to repeat M. de Talleyrand&rsquo;s saying, you are
      laying up an unhappy old age for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Des Lupeaulx was announced. He remembered Lucien, whom he had met at Mme.
      du Val-Noble&rsquo;s, and bowed with a semblance of friendliness which the poet
      could not doubt. Des Lupeaulx was in favor, he was a Master of Requests,
      and did the Ministry secret services; he was, moreover, cunning and
      ambitious, slipping himself in everywhere; he was everybody&rsquo;s friend, for
      he never knew whom he might need. He saw plainly that this was a young
      journalist whose social success would probably equal his success in
      literature; saw, too, that the poet was ambitious, and overwhelmed him
      with protestations and expressions of friendship and interest, till Lucien
      felt as if they were old friends already, and took his promises and
      speeches for more than their worth. Des Lupeaulx made a point of knowing a
      man thoroughly well if he wanted to get rid of him or feared him as a
      rival. So, to all appearance, Lucien was well received. He knew that much
      of his success was owing to the Duc de Rhetore, the Minister, Mme.
      d&rsquo;Espard, and Mme. de Montcornet, and went to spend a few moments with the
      two ladies before taking leave, and talked his very best for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a coxcomb!&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx, turning to the Marquise when he had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be rotten before he is ripe,&rdquo; de Marsay added, smiling. &ldquo;You must
      have private reasons of your own, madame, for turning his head in this
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lucien stepped into the carriage in the courtyard, he found Coralie
      waiting for him. She had come to fetch him. The little attention touched
      him; he told her the history of his evening; and, to his no small
      astonishment, the new notions which even now were running in his head met
      with Coralie&rsquo;s approval. She strongly advised him to enlist under the
      ministerial banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing to expect from the Liberals but hard knocks,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;They plot and conspire; they murdered the Duc de Berri. Will they upset
      the Government? Never! You will never come to anything through them, while
      you will be Comte de Rubempre if you throw in your lot with the other
      side. You might render services to the State, and be a peer of France, and
      marry an heiress. Be an Ultra. It is the proper thing besides,&rdquo; she added,
      this being the last word with her on all subjects. &ldquo;I dined with the
      Val-Noble; she told me that Theodore Gaillard is really going to start his
      little Royalist <i>Revue</i>, so as to reply to your witticisms and the
      jokes in the <i>Miroir</i>. To hear them talk, M. Villele&rsquo;s party will be
      in office before the year is out. Try to turn the change to account before
      they come to power; and say nothing to Etienne and your friends, for they
      are quite equal to playing you some ill turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week later, Lucien went to Mme. de Montcornet&rsquo;s house, and saw the woman
      whom he had so loved, whom later he had stabbed to the heart with a jest.
      He felt the most violent agitation at the sight of her, for Louise also
      had undergone a transformation. She was the Louise that she would always
      have been but for her detention in the provinces&mdash;she was a great
      lady. There was a grace and refinement in her mourning dress which told
      that she was a happy widow; Lucien fancied that this coquetry was aimed in
      some degree at him, and he was right; but, like an ogre, he had tasted
      flesh, and all that evening he vacillated between Coralie&rsquo;s warm,
      voluptuous beauty and the dried-up, haughty, cruel Louise. He could not
      make up his mind to sacrifice the actress to the great lady; and Mme. de
      Bargeton&mdash;all the old feeling reviving in her at the sight of Lucien,
      Lucien&rsquo;s beauty, Lucien&rsquo;s cleverness&mdash;was waiting and expecting that
      sacrifice all evening; and after all her insinuating speeches and her
      fascinations, she had her trouble for her pains. She left the room with a
      fixed determination to be revenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear Lucien,&rdquo; she had said, and in her kindness there was both
      generosity and Parisian grace; &ldquo;well, dear Lucien, so you, that were to
      have been my pride, took me for your first victim; and I forgave you, my
      dear, for I felt that in such a revenge there was a trace of love still
      left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that speech, and the queenly way in which it was uttered, Mme. de
      Bargeton recovered her position. Lucien, convinced that he was a thousand
      times in the right, felt that he had been put in the wrong. Not one word
      of the causes of the rupture! not one syllable of the terrible farewell
      letter! A woman of the world has a wonderful genius for diminishing her
      faults by laughing at them; she can obliterate them all with a smile or a
      question of feigned surprise, and she knows this. She remembers nothing,
      she can explain everything; she is amazed, asks questions, comments,
      amplifies, and quarrels with you, till in the end her sins disappear like
      stains on the application of a little soap and water; black as ink you
      knew them to be; and lo! in a moment, you behold immaculate white
      innocence, and lucky are you if you do not find that you yourself have
      sinned in some way beyond redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment old illusions regained their power over Lucien and Louise;
      they talked like friends, as before; but when the lady, with a hesitating
      sigh, put the question, &ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; Lucien was not ready with a
      prompt, decided answer; he was intoxicated with gratified vanity; Coralie,
      who (let us admit it) had made life easy for him, had turned his head. A
      melancholy &ldquo;No&rdquo; would have made his fortune, but he must needs begin to
      explain his position with regard to Coralie. He said that he was loved for
      his own sake; he said a good many foolish things that a man will say when
      he is smitten with a tender passion, and thought the while that he was
      doing a clever thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Bargeton bit her lips. There was no more to be said. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard
      brought Mme. de Montcornet to her cousin, and Lucien became the hero of
      the evening, so to speak. He was flattered, petted, and made much of by
      the three women; he was entangled with art which no words can describe.
      His social success in this fine and brilliant circle was at least as great
      as his triumphs in journalism. Beautiful Mlle. des Touches, so well known
      as &ldquo;Camille Maupin,&rdquo; asked him to one of her Wednesday dinners; his
      beauty, now so justly famous, seemed to have made an impression upon her.
      Lucien exerted himself to show that his wit equaled his good looks, and
      Mlle. des Touches expressed her admiration with a playful outspokenness
      and a pretty fervor of friendship which deceives those who do not know
      life in Paris to its depths, nor suspect how continual enjoyment whets the
      appetite for novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she should like me as much as I like her, we might abridge the
      romance,&rdquo; said Lucien, addressing de Marsay and Rastignac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You both of you write romances too well to care to live them,&rdquo; returned
      Rastignac. &ldquo;Can men and women who write ever fall in love with each other?
      A time is sure to come when they begin to make little cutting remarks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be a bad dream for you,&rdquo; laughed de Marsay. &ldquo;The charming
      young lady is thirty years old, it is true, but she has an income of
      eighty thousand livres. She is adorably capricious, and her style of
      beauty wears well. Coralie is a silly little fool, my dear boy, well
      enough for a start, for a young spark must have a mistress; but unless you
      make some great conquest in the great world, an actress will do you harm
      in the long run. Now, my boy, go and cut out Conti. Here he is, just about
      to sing with Camille Maupin. Poetry has taken precedence of music ever
      since time began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Lucien heard Mlle. des Touches&rsquo; voice blending with Conti&rsquo;s, his
      hopes fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conti sings too well,&rdquo; he told des Lupeaulx; and he went back to Mme. de
      Bargeton, who carried him off to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard in another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you not interest yourself in him?&rdquo; asked Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquise spoke with an air half kindly, half insolent. &ldquo;Let M. Chardon
      first put himself in such a position that he will not compromise those who
      take an interest in him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If he wishes to drop his patronymic
      and to bear his mother&rsquo;s name, he should at any rate be on the right side,
      should he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In less than two months I will arrange everything,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Mme. d&rsquo;Espard. &ldquo;I will speak to my father and uncle;
      they are in waiting, they will speak to the Chancellor for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The diplomatist and the two women had very soon discovered Lucien&rsquo;s weak
      side. The poet&rsquo;s head was turned by the glory of the aristocracy; every
      man who entered the rooms bore a sounding name mounted in a glittering
      title, and he himself was plain Chardon. Unspeakable mortification filled
      him at the sound of it. Wherever he had been during the last few days,
      that pang had been constantly present with him. He felt, moreover, a
      sensation quite as unpleasant when he went back to his desk after an
      evening spent in the great world, in which he made a tolerable figure,
      thanks to Coralie&rsquo;s carriage and Coralie&rsquo;s servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned to ride, in order to escort Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, Mlle. des Touches,
      and the Comtesse de Montcornet when they drove in the Bois, a privilege
      which he had envied other young men so greatly when he first came to
      Paris. Finot was delighted to give his right-hand man an order for the
      Opera, so Lucien wasted many an evening there, and thenceforward he was
      among the exquisites of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet asked Rastignac and his new associates to a breakfast, and made
      the blunder of giving it in Coralie&rsquo;s rooms in the Rue de Vendome; he was
      too young, too much of a poet, too self-confident, to discern certain
      shades and distinctions in conduct; and how should an actress, a
      good-hearted but uneducated girl, teach him life? His guests were anything
      but charitably disposed towards him; it was clearly proven to their minds
      that Lucien the critic and the actress were in collusion for their mutual
      interests, and all of the young men were jealous of an arrangement which
      all of them stigmatized. The most pitiless of those who laughed that
      evening at Lucien&rsquo;s expense was Rastignac himself. Rastignac had made and
      held his position by very similar means; but so careful had he been of
      appearances, that he could afford to treat scandal as slander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien proved an apt pupil at whist. Play became a passion with him; and
      so far from disapproving, Coralie encouraged his extravagance with the
      peculiar short-sightedness of an all-absorbing love, which sees nothing
      beyond the moment, and is ready to sacrifice anything, even the future, to
      the present enjoyment. Coralie looked on cards as a safe-guard against
      rivals. A great love has much in common with childhood&mdash;a child&rsquo;s
      heedless, careless, spendthrift ways, a child&rsquo;s laughter and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days there lived and flourished a set of young men, some of them
      rich, some poor, and all of them idle, called &ldquo;free-livers&rdquo; (<i>viveurs</i>);
      and, indeed, they lived with incredible insolence&mdash;unabashed and
      unproductive consumers, and yet more intrepid drinkers. These spendthrifts
      mingled the roughest practical jokes with a life not so much reckless as
      suicidal; they drew back from no impossibility, and gloried in pranks
      which, nevertheless, were confined within certain limits; and as they
      showed the most original wit in their escapades, it was impossible not to
      pardon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sign of the times more plainly discovered the helotism to which the
      Restoration had condemned the young manhood of the epoch. The younger men,
      being at a loss to know what to do with themselves, were compelled to find
      other outlets for their superabundant energy besides journalism, or
      conspiracy, or art, or letters. They squandered their strength in the
      wildest excesses, such sap and luxuriant power was there in young France.
      The hard workers among these gilded youths wanted power and pleasure; the
      artists wished for money; the idle sought to stimulate their appetites or
      wished for excitement; one and all of them wanted a place, and one and all
      were shut out from politics and public life. Nearly all the &ldquo;free-livers&rdquo;
       were men of unusual mental powers; some held out against the enervating
      life, others were ruined by it. The most celebrated and the cleverest
      among them was Eugene Rastignac, who entered, with de Marsay&rsquo;s help, upon
      a political career, in which he has since distinguished himself. The
      practical jokes, in which the set indulged became so famous, that not a
      few vaudevilles have been founded upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blondet introduced Lucien to this society of prodigals, of which he became
      a brilliant ornament, ranking next to Bixiou, one of the most mischievous
      and untiring scoffing wits of his time. All through that winter Lucien&rsquo;s
      life was one long fit of intoxication, with intervals of easy work. He
      continued his series of sketches of contemporary life, and very
      occasionally made great efforts to write a few pages of serious criticism,
      on which he brought his utmost power of thought to bear. But study was the
      exception, not the rule, and only undertaken at the bidding of necessity;
      dinners and breakfasts, parties of pleasure and play, took up most of his
      time, and Coralie absorbed all that was left. He would not think of the
      morrow. He saw besides that his so-called friends were leading the same
      life, earning money easily by writing publishers&rsquo; prospectuses and
      articles paid for by speculators; all of them lived beyond their incomes,
      none of them thought seriously of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had been admitted into the ranks of journalism and of literature on
      terms of equality; he foresaw immense difficulties in the way if he should
      try to rise above the rest. Every one was willing to look upon him as an
      equal; no one would have him for a superior. Unconsciously he gave up the
      idea of winning fame in literature, for it seemed easier to gain success
      in politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intrigue raises less opposition than talent,&rdquo; du Chatelet had said one
      day (for Lucien and the Baron had made up their quarrel); &ldquo;a plot below
      the surface rouses no one&rsquo;s attention. Intrigue, moreover, is superior to
      talent, for it makes something out of nothing; while, for the most part,
      the immense resources of talent only injure a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Lucien never lost sight of his principal idea; and though to-morrow,
      following close upon the heels of to-day in the midst of an orgy, never
      found the promised work accomplished, Lucien was assiduous in society. He
      paid court to Mme. de Bargeton, the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, and the Comtesse de
      Montcornet; he never missed a single party given by Mlle. des Touches,
      appearing in society after a dinner given by authors or publishers, and
      leaving the salons for a supper given in consequence of a bet. The demands
      of conversation and the excitement of play absorbed all the ideas and
      energy left by excess. The poet had lost the lucidity of judgment and
      coolness of head which must be preserved if a man is to see all that is
      going on around him, and never to lose the exquisite tact which the <i>parvenu</i>
      needs at every moment. How should he know how many a time Mme. de Bargeton
      left him with wounded susceptibilities, how often she forgave him or added
      one more condemnation to the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatelet saw that his rival had still a chance left, so he became Lucien&rsquo;s
      friend. He encouraged the poet in dissipation that wasted his energies.
      Rastignac, jealous of his fellow-countryman, and thinking, besides, that
      Chatelet would be a surer and more useful ally than Lucien, had taken up
      the Baron&rsquo;s cause. So, some few days after the meeting of the Petrarch and
      Laura of Angouleme, Rastignac brought about the reconciliation between the
      poet and the elderly beau at a sumptuous supper given at the <i>Rocher de
      Cancale</i>. Lucien never returned home till morning, and rose in the
      middle of the day; Coralie was always at his side, he could not forego a
      single pleasure. Sometimes he saw his real position, and made good
      resolutions, but they came to nothing in his idle, easy life; and the
      mainspring of will grew slack, and only responded to the heaviest pressure
      of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie had been glad that Lucien should amuse himself; she had encouraged
      him in this reckless expenditure, because she thought that the cravings
      which she fostered would bind her lover to her. But tender-hearted and
      loving as she was, she found courage to advise Lucien not to forget his
      work, and once or twice was obliged to remind him that he had earned very
      little during the month. Their debts were growing frightfully fast. The
      fifteen hundred francs which remained from the purchase-money of the <i>Marguerites</i>
      had been swallowed up at once, together with Lucien&rsquo;s first five hundred
      livres. In three months he had only made a thousand francs, yet he felt as
      though he had been working tremendously hard. But by this time Lucien had
      adopted the &ldquo;free-livers&rdquo; pleasant theory of debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debts are becoming to a young man, but after the age of five-and-twenty
      they are inexcusable. It should be observed that there are certain natures
      in which a really poetic temper is united with a weakened will; and these
      while absorbed in feeling, that they may transmute personal experience,
      sensation, or impression into some permanent form are essentially
      deficient in the moral sense which should accompany all observation. Poets
      prefer rather to receive their own impressions than to enter into the
      souls of others to study the mechanism of their feelings and thoughts. So
      Lucien neither asked his associates what became of those who disappeared
      from among them, nor looked into the futures of his so-called friends.
      Some of them were heirs to property, others had definite expectations; yet
      others either possessed names that were known in the world, or a most
      robust belief in their destiny and a fixed resolution to circumvent the
      law. Lucien, too, believed in his future on the strength of various
      profound axiomatic sayings of Blondet&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Everything comes out all right
      at last&mdash;If a man has nothing, his affairs cannot be embarrassed&mdash;We
      have nothing to lose but the fortune that we seek&mdash;Swim with the
      stream; it will take you somewhere&mdash;A clever man with a footing in
      society can make a fortune whenever he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That winter, filled as it was with so many pleasures and dissipations, was
      a necessary interval employed in finding capital for the new Royalist
      paper; Theodore Gaillard and Hector Merlin only brought out the first
      number of the <i>Reveil</i> in March 1822. The affair had been settled at
      Mme. du Val-Noble&rsquo;s house. Mme. du val-Noble exercised a certain influence
      over the great personages, Royalist writers, and bankers who met in her
      splendid rooms&mdash;&ldquo;fit for a tale out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,&rdquo; as
      the elegant and clever courtesan herself used to say&mdash;to transact
      business which could not be arranged elsewhere. The editorship had been
      promised to Hector Merlin. Lucien, Merlin&rsquo;s intimate, was pretty certain
      to be his right-hand man, and a <i>feuilleton</i> in a Ministerial paper
      had been promised to him besides. All through the dissipations of that
      winter Lucien had been secretly making ready for this change of front.
      Child as he was, he fancied that he was a deep politician because he
      concealed the preparation for the approaching transformation-scene, while
      he was counting upon Ministerial largesses to extricate himself from
      embarrassment and to lighten Coralie&rsquo;s secret cares. Coralie said nothing
      of her distress; she smiled now, as always; but Berenice was bolder, she
      kept Lucien informed of their difficulties; and the budding great man,
      moved, after the fashion of poets, by the tale of disasters, would vow
      that he would begin to work in earnest, and then forget his resolution,
      and drown his fleeting cares in excess. One day Coralie saw the poetic
      brow overcast, and scolded Berenice, and told her lover that everything
      would be settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard and Mme. de Bargeton were waiting for Lucien&rsquo;s profession of
      his new creed, so they said, before applying through Chatelet for the
      patent which should permit Lucien to bear the so-much desired name. Lucien
      had proposed to dedicate the <i>Marguerites</i> to Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, and the
      Marquise seemed to be not a little flattered by a compliment which authors
      have been somewhat chary of paying since they became a power in the land;
      but when Lucien went to Dauriat and asked after his book, that worthy
      publisher met him with excellent reasons for the delay in its appearance.
      Dauriat had this and that in hand, which took up all his time; a new
      volume by Canalis was coming out, and he did not want the two books to
      clash; M. de Lamartine&rsquo;s second series of <i>Meditations</i> was in the
      press, and two important collections of poetry ought not to appear
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, however, Lucien&rsquo;s needs were so pressing that he had
      recourse to Finot, and received an advance on his work. When, at a
      supper-party that evening, the poet journalist explained his position to
      his friends in the fast set, they drowned his scruples in champagne, iced
      with pleasantries. Debts! There was never yet a man of any power without
      debts! Debts represented satisfied cravings, clamorous vices. A man only
      succeeds under the pressure of the iron hand of necessity. Debts forsooth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the one pledge of which a great man can be sure, is given him by his
      friend the pawnbroker,&rdquo; cried Blondet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want everything, you must owe for everything,&rdquo; called Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; corrected des Lupeaulx, &ldquo;if you owe for everything, you have had
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party contrived to convince the novice that his debts were a golden
      spur to urge on the horses of the chariot of his fortunes. There is always
      the stock example of Julius Caesar with his debt of forty millions, and
      Friedrich II. on an allowance of one ducat a month, and a host of other
      great men whose failings are held up for the corruption of youth, while
      not a word is said of their wide-reaching ideas, their courage equal to
      all odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creditors seized Coralie&rsquo;s horses, carriage, and furniture at last, for an
      amount of four thousand francs. Lucien went to Lousteau and asked his
      friend to meet his bill for the thousand francs lent to pay gaming debts;
      but Lousteau showed him certain pieces of stamped paper, which proved that
      Florine was in much the same case. Lousteau was grateful, however, and
      offered to take the necessary steps for the sale of Lucien&rsquo;s <i>Archer of
      Charles IX.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came Florine to be in this plight?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Matifat took alarm,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;We have lost him; but if Florine
      chooses, she can make him pay dear for his treachery. I will tell you all
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days after this bootless errand, Lucien and Coralie were
      breakfasting in melancholy spirits beside the fire in their pretty
      bedroom. Berenice had cooked a dish of eggs for them over the grate; for
      the cook had gone, and the coachman and servants had taken leave. They
      could not sell the furniture, for it had been attached; there was not a
      single object of any value in the house. A goodly collection of
      pawntickets, forming a very instructive octavo volume, represented all the
      gold, silver, and jewelry. Berenice had kept back a couple of spoons and
      forks, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau&rsquo;s newspaper was of service now to Coralie and Lucien, little as
      they suspected it; for the tailor, dressmaker, and milliner were afraid to
      meddle with a journalist who was quite capable of writing down their
      establishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau broke in upon their breakfast with a shout of &ldquo;Hurrah!
      Long live <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i>! And I have converted a hundred
      francs worth of books into cash, children. We will go halves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed fifty francs to Coralie, and sent Berenice out in quest of a
      more substantial breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hector Merlin and I went to a booksellers&rsquo; trade dinner yesterday, and
      prepared the way for your romance with cunning insinuations. Dauriat is in
      treaty, but Dauriat is haggling over it; he won&rsquo;t give more than four
      thousand francs for two thousand copies, and you want six thousand francs.
      We made you out twice as great as Sir Walter Scott! Oh! you have such
      novels as never were in the inwards of you. It is not a mere book for
      sale, it is a big business; you are not simply the writer of one more or
      less ingenious novel, you are going to write a whole series. The word
      &lsquo;series&rsquo; did it! So, mind you, don&rsquo;t forget that you have a great
      historical series on hand&mdash;<i>La Grande Mademoiselle</i>, or <i>The
      France of Louis Quatorze</i>; <i>Cotillon I.</i>, or <i>The Early Days of
      Louis Quinze</i>; <i>The Queen and the Cardinal</i>, or <i>Paris and the
      Fronde</i>; <i>The Son of the Concini</i>, or <i>Richelieu&rsquo;s Intrigue</i>.
      These novels will be announced on the wrapper of the book. We call this
      manoeuvre &lsquo;giving a success a toss in the coverlet,&rsquo; for the titles are
      all to appear on the cover, till you will be better known for the books
      that you have not written than for the work you have done. And &lsquo;In the
      Press&rsquo; is a way of gaining credit in advance for work that you will do.
      Come, now, let us have a little fun! Here comes the champagne. You can
      understand, Lucien, that our men opened eyes as big as saucers. By the by,
      I see that you have saucers still left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are attached,&rdquo; explained Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, and I resume. Show a publisher one manuscript volume and he
      will believe in all the rest. A publisher asks to see your manuscript, and
      gives you to understand that he is going to read it. Why disturb his
      harmless vanity? They never read a manuscript; they would not publish so
      many if they did. Well, Hector and I allowed it to leak out that you might
      consider an offer of five thousand francs for three thousand copies, in
      two editions. Let me have your <i>Archer</i>; the day after to-morrow we
      are to breakfast with the publishers, and we will get the upper hand of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two partners named Fendant and Cavalier; they are two good fellows,
      pretty straightforward in business. One of them used to be with Vidal and
      Porchon, the other is the cleverest hand on the Quai des Augustins. They
      only started in business last year, and have lost a little on translations
      of English novels; so now my gentlemen have a mind to exploit the native
      product. There is a rumor current that those dealers in spoiled white
      paper are trading on other people&rsquo;s capital; but I don&rsquo;t think it matters
      very much to you who finds the money, so long as you are paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, the pair went to a breakfast in the Rue Serpente, in
      Lucien&rsquo;s old quarter of Paris. Lousteau still kept his room in the Rue de
      la Harpe; and it was in the same state as before, but this time Lucien
      felt no surprise; he had been initiated into the life of journalism; he
      knew all its ups and downs. Since that evening of his introduction to the
      Wooden Galleries, he had been paid for many an article, and gambled away
      the money along with the desire to write. He had filled columns, not once
      but many times, in the ingenious ways described by Lousteau on that
      memorable evening as they went to the Palais Royal. He was dependent upon
      Barbet and Braulard; he trafficked in books and theatre-tickets; he shrank
      no longer from any attack, from writing any panegyric; and at this moment
      he was in some sort rejoicing to make all he could out of Lousteau before
      turning his back on the Liberals. His intimate knowledge of the party
      would stand him in good stead in future. And Lousteau, on his side, was
      privately receiving five hundred francs of purchase-money, under the name
      of commission, from Fendant and Cavalier for introducing the future Sir
      Walter Scott to two enterprising tradesmen in search of a French Author of
      &ldquo;Waverley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The firm of Fendant and Cavalier had started in business without any
      capital whatsoever. A great many publishing houses were established at
      that time in the same way, and are likely to be established so long as
      papermakers and printers will give credit for the time required to play
      some seven or eight of the games of chance called &ldquo;new publications.&rdquo; At
      that time, as at present, the author&rsquo;s copyright was paid for in bills at
      six, nine, and twelve months&mdash;a method of payment determined by the
      custom of the trade, for booksellers settle accounts between themselves by
      bills at even longer dates. Papermakers and printers are paid in the same
      way, so that in practice the publisher-bookseller has a dozen or a score
      of works on sale for a twelvemonth before he pays for them. Even if only
      two or three of these hit the public taste, the profitable speculations
      pay for the bad, and the publisher pays his way by grafting, as it were,
      one book upon another. But if all of them turn out badly; or if, for his
      misfortune, the publisher-bookseller happens to bring out some really good
      literature which stays on hand until the right public discovers and
      appreciates it; or if it costs too much to discount the paper that he
      receives, then, resignedly, he files his schedule, and becomes a bankrupt
      with an untroubled mind. He was prepared all along for something of the
      kind. So, all the chances being in favor of the publishers, they staked
      other people&rsquo;s money, not their own upon the gaming-table of business
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the case with Fendant and Cavalier. Cavalier brought his
      experience, Fendant his industry; the capital was a joint-stock affair,
      and very accurately described by that word, for it consisted in a few
      thousand francs scraped together with difficulty by the mistresses of the
      pair. Out of this fund they allowed each other a fairly handsome salary,
      and scrupulously spent it all in dinners to journalists and authors, or at
      the theatre, where their business was transacted, as they said. This
      questionably honest couple were both supposed to be clever men of
      business, but Fendant was more slippery than Cavalier. Cavalier, true to
      his name, traveled about, Fendant looked after business in Paris. A
      partnership between two publishers is always more or less of a duel, and
      so it was with Fendant and Cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had brought out plenty of romances already, such as the <i>Tour du
      Nord</i>, <i>Le Marchand de Benares</i>, <i>La Fontaine du Sepulcre</i>,
      and <i>Tekeli</i>, translations of the works of Galt, an English novelist
      who never attained much popularity in France. The success of translations
      of Scott had called the attention of the trade to English novels. The race
      of publishers, all agog for a second Norman conquest, were seeking
      industriously for a second Scott, just as at a rather later day every one
      must needs look for asphalt in stony soil, or bitumen in marshes, and
      speculate in projected railways. The stupidity of the Paris commercial
      world is conspicuous in these attempts to do the same thing twice, for
      success lies in contraries; and in Paris, of all places in the world,
      success spoils success. So beneath the title of <i>Strelitz, or Russia a
      Hundred Years Ago</i>, Fendant and Cavalier rashly added in big letters
      the words, &ldquo;In the style of Scott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fendant and Cavalier were in great need of a success. A single good book
      might float their sunken bales, they thought; and there was the alluring
      prospect besides of articles in the newspapers, the great way of promoting
      sales in those days. A book is very seldom bought and sold for its just
      value, and purchases are determined by considerations quite other than the
      merits of the work. So Fendant and Cavalier thought of Lucien as a
      journalist, and of his book as a salable article, which would help them to
      tide over their monthly settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partners occupied the ground floor of one of the great old-fashioned
      houses in the Rue Serpente; their private office had been contrived at the
      further end of a suite of large drawing-rooms, now converted into
      warehouses for books. Lucien and Etienne found the publishers in their
      office, the agreement drawn up, and the bills ready. Lucien wondered at
      such prompt action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fendant was short and thin, and by no means reassuring of aspect. With his
      low, narrow forehead, sunken nose, and hard mouth, he looked like a
      Kalmuck Tartar; a pair of small, wide-awake black eyes, the crabbed
      irregular outline of his countenance, a voice like a cracked bell&mdash;the
      man&rsquo;s whole appearance, in fact, combined to give the impression that this
      was a consummate rascal. A honeyed tongue compensated for these
      disadvantages, and he gained his ends by talk. Cavalier, a stout,
      thick-set young fellow, looked more like the driver of a mail coach than a
      publisher; he had hair of a sandy color, a fiery red countenance, and the
      heavy build and untiring tongue of a commercial traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need to discuss this affair,&rdquo; said Fendant, addressing Lucien
      and Lousteau. &ldquo;I have read the work, it is very literary, and so exactly
      the kind of thing we want, that I have sent it off as it is to the
      printer. The agreement is drawn on the lines laid down, and besides, we
      always make the same stipulations in all cases. The bills fall due in six,
      nine, and twelve months respectively; you will meet with no difficulty in
      discounting them, and we will refund you the discount. We have reserved
      the right of giving a new title to the book. We don&rsquo;t care for <i>The
      Archer of Charles IX.</i>; it doesn&rsquo;t tickle the reader&rsquo;s curiosity
      sufficiently; there were several kings of that name, you see, and there
      were so many archers in the Middle Ages. If you had only called it the <i>Soldier
      of Napoleon</i>, now! But <i>The Archer of Charles IX.</i>!&mdash;why,
      Cavalier would have to give a course of history lessons before he could
      place a copy anywhere in the provinces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you but knew the class of people that we have to do with!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Saint Bartholomew</i> would suit better,&rdquo; continued Fendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, or France under Charles IX.</i>, would sound
      more like one of Scott&rsquo;s novels,&rdquo; added Cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will settle it when the work is printed,&rdquo; said Fendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you please, so long as I approve your title,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement was read over, signed in duplicate, and each of the
      contracting parties took their copy. Lucien put the bills in his pocket
      with unequaled satisfaction, and the four repaired to Fendant&rsquo;s abode,
      where they breakfasted on beefsteaks and oysters, kidneys in champagne,
      and Brie cheese; but if the fare was something of the homeliest, the wines
      were exquisite; Cavalier had an acquaintance a traveler in the wine trade.
      Just as they sat down to table the printer appeared, to Lucien&rsquo;s surprise,
      with the first two proof-sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to get on with it,&rdquo; Fendant said; &ldquo;we are counting on your book;
      we want a success confoundedly badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast, begun at noon, lasted till five o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we get cash for these things?&rdquo; asked Lucien as they came
      away, somewhat heated and flushed with the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might try Barbet,&rdquo; suggested Etienne, and they turned down to the Quai
      des Augustins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie is astonished to the highest degree over Florine&rsquo;s loss. Florine
      only told her about it yesterday; she seemed to lay the blame of it on
      you, and was so vexed, that she was ready to throw you over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Lousteau. Wine had got the better of prudence, and he
      unbosomed himself to Lucien, ending up with: &ldquo;My friend&mdash;for you are
      my friend, Lucien; you lent me a thousand francs, and you have only once
      asked me for the money&mdash;shun play! If I had never touched a card, I
      should be a happy man. I owe money all round. At this moment I have the
      bailiffs at my heels; indeed, when I go to the Palais Royal, I have
      dangerous capes to double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the language of the fast set, doubling a cape meant dodging a creditor,
      or keeping out of his way. Lucien had not heard the expression before, but
      he was familiar with the practice by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your debts so heavy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere trifle,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;A thousand crowns would pull me through.
      I have resolved to turn steady and give up play, and I have done a little
      &lsquo;chantage&rsquo; to pay my debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is &lsquo;chantage&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an English invention recently imported. A &lsquo;chanteur&rsquo; is a man who
      can manage to put a paragraph in the papers&mdash;never an editor nor a
      responsible man, for they are not supposed to know anything about it, and
      there is always a Giroudeau or a Philippe Bridau to be found. A bravo of
      this stamp finds up somebody who has his own reasons for not wanting to be
      talked about. Plenty of people have a few peccadilloes, or some more or
      less original sin, upon their consciences; there are plenty of fortunes
      made in ways that would not bear looking into; sometimes a man has kept
      the letter of the law, and sometimes he has not; and in either case, there
      is a tidbit of tattle for the inquirer, as, for instance, that tale of
      Fouche&rsquo;s police surrounding the spies of the Prefect of Police, who, not
      being in the secret of the fabrication of forged English banknotes, were
      just about to pounce on the clandestine printers employed by the Minister,
      or there is the story of Prince Galathionne&rsquo;s diamonds, the Maubreuile
      affair, or the Pombreton will case. The &lsquo;chanteur&rsquo; gets possession of some
      compromising letter, asks for an interview; and if the man that made the
      money does not buy silence, the &lsquo;chanteur&rsquo; draws a picture of the press
      ready to take the matter up and unravel his private affairs. The rich man
      is frightened, he comes down with the money, and the trick succeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are committed to some risky venture, which might easily be written
      down in a series of articles; a &lsquo;chanteur&rsquo; waits upon you, and offers to
      withdraw the articles&mdash;for a consideration. &lsquo;Chanteurs&rsquo; are sent to
      men in office, who will bargain that their acts and not their private
      characters are to be attacked, or they are heedless of their characters,
      and anxious only to shield the woman they love. One of your acquaintance,
      that charming Master of Requests des Lupeaulx, is a kind of agent for
      affairs of this sort. The rascal has made a position for himself in the
      most marvelous way in the very centre of power; he is the middle-man of
      the press and the ambassador of the Ministers; he works upon a man&rsquo;s
      self-love; he bribes newspapers to pass over a loan in silence, or to make
      no comment on a contract which was never put up for public tender, and the
      jackals of Liberal bankers get a share out of it. That was a bit of
      &lsquo;chantage&rsquo; that you did with Dauriat; he gave you a thousand crowns to let
      Nathan alone. In the eighteenth century, when journalism was still in its
      infancy, this kind of blackmail was levied by pamphleteers in the pay of
      favorites and great lords. The original inventor was Pietro Aretino, a
      great Italian. Kings went in fear of him, as stage-players go in fear of a
      newspaper to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to the Matifat to make the thousand crowns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I attacked Florine in half a dozen papers. Florine complained to Matifat.
      Matifat went to Braulard to find out what the attacks meant. I did my
      &lsquo;chantage&rsquo; for Finot&rsquo;s benefit, and Finot put Braulard on the wrong scent;
      Braulard told the man of drugs that <i>you</i> were demolishing Florine in
      Coralie&rsquo;s interest. Then Giroudeau went round to Matifat and told him (in
      confidence) that the whole business could be accommodated if he (Matifat)
      would consent to sell his sixth share in Finot&rsquo;s review for ten thousand
      francs. Finot was to give me a thousand crowns if the dodge succeeded.
      Well, Matifat was only too glad to get back ten thousand francs out of the
      thirty thousand invested in a risky speculation, as he thought, for
      Florine had been telling him for several days past that Finot&rsquo;s review was
      doing badly; and, instead of paying a dividend, something was said of
      calling up more capital. So Matifat was just about to close with the
      offer, when the manager of the Panorama-Dramatique comes to him with some
      accommodation bills that he wanted to negotiate before filing his
      schedule. To induce Matifat to take them of him, he let out a word of
      Finot&rsquo;s trick. Matifat, being a shrewd man of business, took the hint,
      held tight to his sixth, and is laughing in his sleeve at us. Finot and I
      are howling with despair. We have been so misguided as to attack a man who
      has no affection for his mistress, a heartless, soulless wretch.
      Unluckily, too, for us, Matifat&rsquo;s business is not amenable to the
      jurisdiction of the press, and he cannot be made to smart for it through
      his interests. A druggist is not like a hatter or a milliner, or a theatre
      or a work of art; he is above criticism; you can&rsquo;t run down his opium and
      dyewoods, nor cocoa beans, paint, and pepper. Florine is at her wits&rsquo; end;
      the Panorama closes to-morrow, and what will become of her she does not
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coralie&rsquo;s engagement at the Gymnase begins in a few days,&rdquo; said Lucien;
      &ldquo;she might do something for Florine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she!&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Coralie is not clever, but she is not quite
      simple enough to help herself to a rival. We are in a mess with a
      vengeance. And Finot is in such a hurry to buy back his sixth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a capital bit of business, my dear fellow. There is a chance of
      selling the paper for three hundred thousand francs; Finot would have
      one-third, and his partners besides are going to pay him a commission,
      which he will share with des Lupeaulx. So I propose to do another turn of
      &lsquo;chantage.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Chantage&rsquo; seems to mean your money or your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better than that,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;it is your money or your
      character. A short time ago the proprietor of a minor newspaper was
      refused credit. The day before yesterday it was announced in his columns
      that a gold repeater set with diamonds belonging to a certain notability
      had found its way in a curious fashion into the hands of a private soldier
      in the Guards; the story promised to the readers might have come from the
      <i>Arabian Nights</i>. The notability lost no time in asking that editor
      to dine with him; the editor was distinctly a gainer by the transaction,
      and contemporary history has lost an anecdote. Whenever the press makes
      vehement onslaughts upon some one in power, you may be sure that there is
      some refusal to do a service behind it. Blackmailing with regard to
      private life is the terror of the richest Englishman, and a great source
      of wealth to the press in England, which is infinitely more corrupt than
      ours. We are children in comparison! In England they will pay five or six
      thousand francs for a compromising letter to sell again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can you lay hold of Matifat?&rdquo; asked Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, that low tradesman wrote the queerest letters to Florine;
      the spelling, style, and matter of them is ludicrous to the last degree.
      We can strike him in the very midst of his Lares and Penates, where he
      feels himself safest, without so much as mentioning his name; and he
      cannot complain, for he lives in fear and terror of his wife. Imagine his
      wrath when he sees the first number of a little serial entitled the <i>Amours
      of a Druggist</i>, and is given fair warning that his love-letters have
      fallen into the hands of certain journalists. He talks about the &lsquo;little
      god Cupid,&rsquo; he tells Florine that she enables him to cross the desert of
      life (which looks as if he took her for a camel), and spells &lsquo;never&rsquo; with
      two v&rsquo;s. There is enough in that immensely funny correspondence to bring
      an influx of subscribers for a fortnight. He will shake in his shoes lest
      an anonymous letter should supply his wife with the key to the riddle. The
      question is whether Florine will consent to appear to persecute Matifat.
      She has some principles, which is to say, some hopes, still left. Perhaps
      she means to keep the letters and make something for herself out of them.
      She is cunning, as befits my pupil. But as soon as she finds out that a
      bailiff is no laughing matter, or Finot gives her a suitable present or
      hopes of an engagement, she will give me the letters, and I will sell them
      to Finot. Finot will put the correspondence in his uncle&rsquo;s hands, and
      Giroudeau will bring Matifat to terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These confidences sobered Lucien. His first thought was that he had some
      extremely dangerous friends; his second, that it would be impolitic to
      break with them; for if Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and Chatelet
      should fail to keep their word with him, he might need their terrible
      power yet. By this time Etienne and Lucien had reached Barbet&rsquo;s miserable
      bookshop on the Quai. Etienne addressed Barbet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have five thousand francs&rsquo; worth of bills at six, nine, and twelve
      months, given by Fendant and Cavalier. Are you willing to discount them
      for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you three thousand francs for them,&rdquo; said Barbet with
      imperturbable coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand francs!&rdquo; echoed Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody else will give you as much,&rdquo; rejoined the bookseller. &ldquo;The firm
      will go bankrupt before three months are out; but I happen to know that
      they have some good books that are hanging on hand; they cannot afford to
      wait, so I shall buy their stock for cash and pay them with their own
      bills, and get the books at a reduction of two thousand francs. That&rsquo;s how
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind losing a couple of thousand francs, Lucien?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Lucien answered vehemently. He was dismayed by this first rebuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making a mistake,&rdquo; said Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find any one that will take their paper,&rdquo; said Barbet. &ldquo;Your
      book is their last stake, sir. The printer will not trust them; they are
      obliged to leave the copies in pawn with him. If they make a hit now, it
      will only stave off bankruptcy for another six months, sooner or later
      they will have to go. They are cleverer at tippling than at bookselling.
      In my own case, their bills mean business; and that being so, I can afford
      to give more than a professional discounter who simply looks at the
      signatures. It is a bill-discounter&rsquo;s business to know whether the three
      names on a bill are each good for thirty per cent in case of bankruptcy.
      And here at the outset you only offer two signatures, and neither of them
      worth ten per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two journalists exchanged glances in surprise. Here was a little scrub
      of a bookseller putting the essence of the art and mystery of
      bill-discounting in these few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Barbet,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Can you tell us of a bill-broker
      that will look at us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Daddy Chaboisseau, on the Quai Saint-Michel, you know. He tided
      Fendant over his last monthly settlement. If you won&rsquo;t listen to my offer,
      you might go and see what he says to you; but you would only come back to
      me, and then I shall offer you two thousand francs instead of three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne and Lucien betook themselves to the Quai Saint-Michel, and found
      Chaboisseau in a little house with a passage entry. Chaboisseau, a
      bill-discounter, whose dealings were principally with the book trade,
      lived in a second-floor lodging furnished in the most eccentric manner. A
      brevet-rank banker and millionaire to boot, he had a taste for the
      classical style. The cornice was in the classical style; the bedstead, in
      the purest classical taste, dated from the time of the Empire, when such
      things were in fashion; the purple hangings fell over the wall like the
      classic draperies in the background of one of David&rsquo;s pictures. Chairs and
      tables, lamps and sconces, and every least detail had evidently been
      sought with patient care in furniture warehouses. There was the elegance
      of antiquity about the classic revival as well as its fragile and somewhat
      arid grace. The man himself, like his manner of life, was in grotesque
      contrast with the airy mythological look of his rooms; and it may be
      remarked that the most eccentric characters are found among men who give
      their whole energies to money-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of this stamp are, in a certain sense, intellectual libertines.
      Everything is within their reach, consequently their fancy is jaded, and
      they will make immense efforts to shake off their indifference. The
      student of human nature can always discover some hobby, some accessible
      weakness and sensitive spot in their heart. Chaboisseau might have
      entrenched himself in antiquity as in an impregnable camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man will be an antique to match, no doubt,&rdquo; said Etienne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaboisseau, a little old person with powdered hair, wore a greenish coat
      and snuff-brown waistcoat; he was tricked out besides in black
      small-clothes, ribbed stockings, and shoes that creaked as he came forward
      to take the bills. After a short scrutiny, he returned them to Lucien with
      a serious countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MM Fendant and Cavalier are delightful young fellows; they have plenty of
      intelligence; but, I have no money,&rdquo; he said blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend here would be willing to meet you in the matter of discount&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Etienne began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not take the bills on any consideration,&rdquo; returned the little
      broker. The words slid down upon Lousteau&rsquo;s suggestion like the blade of
      the guillotine on a man&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends withdrew; but as Chaboisseau went prudently out with them
      across the ante-chamber, Lucien noticed a pile of second-hand books.
      Chaboisseau had been in the trade, and this was a recent purchase. Shining
      conspicuous among them, he noticed a copy of a work by the architect
      Ducereau, which gives exceedingly accurate plans of various royal palaces
      and chateaux in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you let me have that book?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Chaboisseau, transformed into a bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dear, but I want it. And I can only pay you with one of the bills
      which you refuse to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a bill there for five hundred francs at six months; I will take
      that one of you,&rdquo; said Chaboisseau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently at the last statement of accounts, there had been a balance of
      five hundred francs in favor of Fendant and Cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the classical department. Chaboisseau made out a little
      memorandum, interest so much and commission so much, total deduction
      thirty francs, then he subtracted fifty francs for Ducerceau&rsquo;s book;
      finally, from a cash-box full of coin, he took four hundred and twenty
      francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, though, M. Chaboisseau, the bills are either all of them good,
      or all bad alike; why don&rsquo;t you take the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not discounting; I am paying myself for a sale,&rdquo; said the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne and Lucien were still laughing at Chaboisseau, without
      understanding him, when they reached Dauriat&rsquo;s shop, and Etienne asked
      Gabusson to give them the name of a bill-broker. Gabusson thus appealed to
      gave them a letter of introduction to a broker in the Boulevard
      Poissonniere, telling them at the same time that this was the &ldquo;oddest and
      queerest party&rdquo; (to use his own expression) that he, Gabusson, had come
      across. The friends took a cab by the hour, and went to the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Samanon won&rsquo;t take your bills,&rdquo; Gabusson had said, &ldquo;nobody else will
      look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second-hand bookseller on the ground floor, a second-hand clothes-dealer
      on the first story, and a seller of indecent prints on the second, Samanon
      carried on a fourth business&mdash;he was a money-lender into the bargain.
      No character in Hoffmann&rsquo;s romances, no sinister-brooding miser of
      Scott&rsquo;s, can compare with this freak of human and Parisian nature (always
      admitting that Samanon was human). In spite of himself, Lucien shuddered
      at the sight of the dried-up little old creature, whose bones seemed to be
      cutting a leather skin, spotted with all sorts of little green and yellow
      patches, like a portrait by Titian or Veronese when you look at it
      closely. One of Samanon&rsquo;s eyes was fixed and glassy, the other lively and
      bright; he seemed to keep that dead eye for the bill-discounting part of
      his profession, and the other for the trade in the pornographic
      curiosities upstairs. A few stray white hairs escaping from under a small,
      sleek, rusty black wig, stood erect above a sallow forehead with a
      suggestion of menace about it; a hollow trench in either cheek defined the
      outline of the jaws; while a set of projecting teeth, still white, seemed
      to stretch the skin of the lips with the effect of an equine yawn. The
      contrast between the ill-assorted eyes and grinning mouth gave Samanon a
      passably ferocious air; and the very bristles on the man&rsquo;s chin looked
      stiff and sharp as pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there the slightest sign about him of any desire to redeem a
      sinister appearance by attention to the toilet; his threadbare jacket was
      all but dropping to pieces; a cravat, which had once been black, was
      frayed by contact with a stubble chin, and left on exhibition a throat as
      wrinkled as a turkey-gobbler&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the individual whom Etienne and Lucien discovered in his filthy
      counting-house, busily affixing tickets to the backs of a parcel of books
      from a recent sale. In a glance, the friends exchanged the innumerable
      questions raised by the existence of such a creature; then they presented
      Gabusson&rsquo;s introduction and Fendant and Cavalier&rsquo;s bills. Samanon was
      still reading the note when a third comer entered, the wearer of a short
      jacket, which seemed in the dimly-lighted shop to be cut out of a piece of
      zinc roofing, so solid was it by reason of alloy with all kinds of foreign
      matter. Oddly attired as he was, the man was an artist of no small
      intellectual power, and ten years later he was destined to assist in the
      inauguration of the great but ill-founded Saint-Simonian system.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my coat, my black trousers, and satin waistcoat,&rdquo; said this
      person, pressing a numbered ticket on Samanon&rsquo;s attention. Samanon touched
      the brass button of a bell-pull, and a woman came down from some upper
      region, a Normande apparently, to judge by her rich, fresh complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the gentleman have his clothes,&rdquo; said Samanon, holding out a hand to
      the newcomer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to do business with you, sir; but that
      youngster whom one of your friends introduced to me took me in most
      abominably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took <i>him</i> in!&rdquo; chuckled the newcomer, pointing out Samanon to the
      two journalists with an extremely comical gesture. The great man dropped
      thirty sous into the money-lender&rsquo;s yellow, wrinkled hand; like the
      Neapolitan <i>lazzaroni</i>, he was taking his best clothes out of pawn
      for a state occasion. The coins dropped jingling into the till.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What queer business are you up to?&rdquo; asked Lousteau of the artist, an
      opium-eater who dwelt among visions of enchanted palaces till he either
      could not or would not create.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> lends you a good deal more than an ordinary pawnbroker on
      anything you pledge; and, besides, he is so awfully charitable, he allows
      you to take your clothes out when you must have something to wear. I am
      going to dine with the Kellers and my mistress to-night,&rdquo; he continued;
      &ldquo;and to me it is easier to find thirty sous than two hundred francs, so I
      keep my wardrobe here. It has brought the charitable usurer a hundred
      francs in the last six months. Samanon has devoured my library already,
      volume by volume&rdquo; (<i>livre a livre</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sou by sou,&rdquo; Lousteau said with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let you have fifteen hundred francs,&rdquo; said Samanon, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien started, as if the bill-broker had thrust a red-hot skewer through
      his heart. Samanon was subjecting the bills and their dates to a close
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I must see Fendant first. He ought to deposit
      some books with me. You aren&rsquo;t worth much&rdquo; (turning to Lucien); &ldquo;you are
      living with Coralie, and your furniture has been attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, watching Lucien, saw him take up his bills, and dash out into
      the street. &ldquo;He is the devil himself!&rdquo; exclaimed the poet. For several
      seconds he stood outside gazing at the shop front. The whole place was so
      pitiful, that a passer-by could not see it without smiling at the sight,
      and wondering what kind of business a man could do among those mean, dirty
      shelves of ticketed books.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few moments later, the great man, in incognito, came out, very well
      dressed, smiled at his friends, and turned to go with them in the
      direction of the Passage des Panoramas, where he meant to complete his
      toilet by the polishing of his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see Samanon in a bookseller&rsquo;s shop, or calling on a paper-merchant
      or a printer, you may know that it is all over with that man,&rdquo; said the
      artist. &ldquo;Samanon is the undertaker come to take the measurements for a
      coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t discount your bills now, Lucien,&rdquo; said Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Samanon will not take them, nobody else will; he is the <i>ultima
      ratio</i>,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;He is one of Gigonnet&rsquo;s lambs, a spy for
      Palma, Werbrust, Gobseck, and the rest of those crocodiles who swim in the
      Paris money-market. Every man with a fortune to make, or unmake, is sure
      to come across one of them sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot discount your bills at fifty per cent,&rdquo; remarked Lousteau,
      &ldquo;you must exchange them for hard cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them to Coralie; Camusot will cash them for her.&mdash;You are
      disgusted,&rdquo; added Lousteau, as Lucien cut him short with a start. &ldquo;What
      nonsense! How can you allow such a silly scruple to turn the scale, when
      your future is in the balance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take this money to Coralie in any case,&rdquo; began Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is more folly!&rdquo; cried Lousteau. &ldquo;You will not keep your creditors
      quiet with four hundred francs when you must have four thousand. Let us
      keep a little and get drunk on it, if we lose the rest at <i>rouge et noir</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sound advice,&rdquo; said the great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words, spoken not four paces from Frascati&rsquo;s, were magnetic in their
      effect. The friends dismissed their cab and went up to the gaming-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset they won three thousand francs, then they lost and fell to
      five hundred; again they won three thousand seven hundred francs, and
      again they lost all but a five-franc piece. After another turn of luck
      they staked two thousand francs on an even number to double the stake at a
      stroke; an even number had not turned up for five times in succession, and
      this was the sixth time. They punted the whole sum, and an odd number
      turned up once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two hours of all-absorbing, frenzied excitement, the two dashed down
      the staircase with the hundred francs kept back for the dinner. Upon the
      steps, between two pillars which support the little sheet-iron veranda to
      which so many eyes have been upturned in longing or despair, Lousteau
      stopped and looked into Lucien&rsquo;s flushed, excited face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us just try fifty francs,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And up the stairs again they went. An hour later they owned a thousand
      crowns. Black had turned up for the fifth consecutive time; they trusted
      that their previous luck would not repeat itself, and put the whole sum on
      the red&mdash;black turned up for the sixth time. They had lost. It was
      now six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us just try twenty-five francs,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new venture was soon made&mdash;and lost. The twenty-five francs went
      in five stakes. Then Lucien, in a frenzy, flung down his last twenty-five
      francs on the number of his age, and won. No words can describe how his
      hands trembled as he raked in the coins which the bank paid him one by
      one. He handed ten louis to Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;take it to Very&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau took the hint and went to order dinner. Lucien, left alone, laid
      his thirty louis on the red and won. Emboldened by the inner voice which a
      gambler always hears, he staked the whole again on the red, and again he
      won. He felt as if there were a furnace within him. Without heeding the
      voice, he laid a hundred and twenty louis on the black and lost. Then to
      the torturing excitement of suspense succeeded the delicious feeling of
      relief known to the gambler who has nothing left to lose, and must
      perforce leave the palace of fire in which his dreams melt and vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Lousteau at Very&rsquo;s, and flung himself upon the cookery (to make
      use of Lafontaine&rsquo;s expression), and drowned his cares in wine. By nine
      o&rsquo;clock his ideas were so confused that he could not imagine why the
      portress in the Rue de Vendome persisted in sending him to the Rue de la
      Lune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mlle. Coralie has gone,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;She has taken lodgings
      elsewhere. She left her address with me on this scrap of paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was too far gone to be surprised at anything. He went back to the
      cab which had brought him, and was driven to the Rue de la Lune, making
      puns to himself on the name of the street as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the failure of the Panorama-Dramatique had come like a
      thunder-clap. Coralie, taking alarm, made haste to sell her furniture
      (with the consent of her creditors) to little old Cardot, who installed
      Florentine in the rooms at once. The tradition of the house remained
      unbroken. Coralie paid her creditors and satisfied the landlord,
      proceeding with her &ldquo;washing-day,&rdquo; as she called it, while Berenice bought
      the absolutely indispensable necessaries to furnish a fourth-floor lodging
      in the Rue de la Lune, a few doors from the Gymnase. Here Coralie was
      waiting for Lucien&rsquo;s return. She had brought her love unsullied out of the
      shipwreck and twelve hundred francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, more than half intoxicated, poured out his woes to Coralie and
      Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did quite right, my angel,&rdquo; said Coralie, with her arms about his
      neck. &ldquo;Berenice can easily negotiate your bills with Braulard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Lucien awoke to an enchanted world of happiness made
      about him by Coralie. She was more loving and tender in those days than
      she had ever been; perhaps she thought that the wealth of love in her
      heart should make him amends for the poverty of their lodging. She looked
      bewitchingly charming, with the loose hair straying from under the crushed
      white silk handkerchief about her head; there was soft laughter in her
      eyes; her words were as bright as the first rays of sunrise that shone in
      through the windows, pouring a flood of gold upon such charming poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that the room was squalid. The walls were covered with a sea-green
      paper, bordered with red; there was one mirror over the chimney-piece, and
      a second above the chest of drawers. The bare boards were covered with a
      cheap carpet, which Berenice had bought in spite of Coralie&rsquo;s orders, and
      paid for out of her own little store. A wardrobe, with a glass door and a
      chest, held the lovers&rsquo; clothing, the mahogany chairs were covered with
      blue cotton stuff, and Berenice had managed to save a clock and a couple
      of china vases from the catastrophe, as well as four spoons and forks and
      half-a-dozen little spoons. The bedroom was entered from the dining-room,
      which might have belonged to a clerk with an income of twelve hundred
      francs. The kitchen was next the landing, and Berenice slept above in an
      attic. The rent was not more than a hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal house boasted a sham carriage entrance, the porter&rsquo;s box being
      contrived behind one of the useless leaves of the gate, and lighted by a
      peephole through which that personage watched the comings and goings of
      seventeen families, for this hive was a &ldquo;good-paying property,&rdquo; in
      auctioneer&rsquo;s phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien, looking round the room, discovered a desk, an easy-chair, paper,
      pens, and ink. The sight of Berenice in high spirits (she was building
      hopes on Coralie&rsquo;s <i>debut</i> at the Gymnase), and of Coralie herself
      conning her part with a knot of blue ribbon tied about it, drove all cares
      and anxieties from the sobered poet&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as nobody in society hears of this sudden comedown, we shall pull
      through,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all, we have four thousand five hundred francs
      before us. I will turn my new position in Royalist journalism to account.
      To-morrow we shall start the <i>Reveil</i>; I am an old hand now, and I
      will make something out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Coralie, seeing nothing but love in the words, kissed the lips that
      uttered them. By this time Berenice had set the table near the fire and
      served a modest breakfast of scrambled eggs, a couple of cutlets, coffee,
      and cream. Just then there came a knock at the door, and Lucien, to his
      astonishment, beheld three of his loyal friends of old days&mdash;d&rsquo;Arthez,
      Leon Giraud, and Michel Chrestien. He was deeply touched, and asked them
      to share the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we have come on more serious business than condolence,&rdquo; said
      d&rsquo;Arthez; &ldquo;we know the whole story, we have just come from the Rue de
      Vendome. You know my opinions, Lucien. Under any other circumstances I
      should be glad to hear that you had adopted my political convictions; but
      situated as you are with regard to the Liberal Press, it is impossible for
      you to go over to the Ultras. Your life will be sullied, your character
      blighted for ever. We have come to entreat you in the name of our
      friendship, weakened though it may be, not to soil yourself in this way.
      You have been prominent in attacking the Romantics, the Right, and the
      Government; you cannot now declare for the Government; the Right, and the
      Romantics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reasons for the change are based on lofty grounds; the end will
      justify the means,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do not fully comprehend our position on the side of the
      Government,&rdquo; said Leon Giraud. &ldquo;The Government, the Court, the Bourbons,
      the Absolutist Party, or to sum up in the general expression, the whole
      system opposed to the constitutional system, may be divided upon the
      question of the best means of extinguishing the Revolution, but is
      unanimous as to the advisability of extinguishing the newspapers. The <i>Reveil</i>,
      the <i>Foudre</i>, and the <i>Drapeau Blanc</i> have all been founded for
      the express purpose of replying to the slander, gibes, and railing of the
      Liberal press. I cannot approve them, for it is precisely this failure to
      recognize the grandeur of our priesthood that has led us to bring out a
      serious and self-respecting paper; which perhaps,&rdquo; he added
      parenthetically, &ldquo;may exercise a worthy influence before very long, and
      win respect, and carry weight; but this Royalist artillery is destined for
      a first attempt at reprisals, the Liberals are to be paid back in their
      own coin&mdash;shaft for shaft, wound for wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can come of it Lucien? The majority of newspaper readers incline for
      the Left; and in the press, as in warfare, the victory is with the big
      battalions. You will be blackguards, liars, enemies of the people; the
      other side will be defenders of their country, martyrs, men to be held in
      honor, though they may be even more hypocritical and slippery than their
      opponents. In these ways the pernicious influence of the press will be
      increased, while the most odious form of journalism will receive sanction.
      Insult and personalities will become a recognized privilege of the press;
      newspapers have taken this tone in the subscribers&rsquo; interests; and when
      both sides have recourse to the same weapons, the standard is set and the
      general tone of journalism taken for granted. When the evil is developed
      to its fullest extent, restrictive laws will be followed by prohibitions;
      there will be a return of the censorship of the press imposed after the
      assassination of the Duc de Berri, and repealed since the opening of the
      Chambers. And do you know what the nation will conclude from the debate?
      The people will believe the insinuations of the Liberal press; they will
      think that the Bourbons mean to attack the rights of property acquired by
      the Revolution, and some fine day they will rise and shake off the
      Bourbons. You are not only soiling your life, Lucien, you are going over
      to the losing side. You are too young, too lately a journalist, too little
      initiated into the secret springs of motive and the tricks of the craft,
      you have aroused too much jealousy, not to fall a victim to the general
      hue and cry that will be raised against you in the Liberal newspapers. You
      will be drawn into the fray by party spirit now still at fever-heat;
      though the fever, which spent itself in violence in 1815 and 1816, now
      appears in debates in the Chamber and polemics in the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite a featherhead, my friends,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;though you may
      choose to see a poet in me. Whatever may happen, I shall gain one solid
      advantage which no Liberal victory can give me. By the time your victory
      is won, I shall have gained my end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will cut off&mdash;your hair,&rdquo; said Michel Chrestien, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have my children by that time,&rdquo; said Lucien; &ldquo;and if you cut off
      my head, it will not matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three could make nothing of Lucien. Intercourse with the great world
      had developed in him the pride of caste, the vanities of the aristocrat.
      The poet thought, and not without reason, that there was a fortune in his
      good looks and intellect, accompanied by the name and title of Rubempre.
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard and Mme. de Bargeton held him fast by this clue, as a child
      holds a cockchafer by a string. Lucien&rsquo;s flight was circumscribed. The
      words, &ldquo;He is one of us, he is sound,&rdquo; accidentally overheard but three
      days ago in Mlle. de Touches&rsquo; salon, had turned his head. The Duc de
      Lenoncourt, the Duc de Navarreins, the Duc de Grandlieu, Rastignac,
      Blondet, the lovely Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, the Comte d&rsquo;Escrignon, and
      des Lupeaulx, all the most influential people at Court in fact, had
      congratulated him on his conversion, and completed his intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no more to be said,&rdquo; d&rsquo;Arthez rejoined. &ldquo;You, of all men,
      will find it hard to keep clean hands and self-respect. I know you,
      Lucien; you will feel it acutely when you are despised by the very men to
      whom you offer yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three took leave, and not one of them gave him a friendly handshake.
      Lucien was thoughtful and sad for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never mind those ninnies,&rdquo; cried Coralie, springing upon his knee and
      putting her beautiful arms about his neck. &ldquo;They take life seriously, and
      life is a joke. Besides, you are going to be Count Lucien de Rubempre. I
      will wheedle the <i>Chancellerie</i> if there is no other way. I know how
      to come round that rake of a des Lupeaulx, who will sign your patent. Did
      I not tell you, Lucien, that at the last you should have Coralie&rsquo;s dead
      body for a stepping stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Lucien allowed his name to appear in the list of contributors to
      the <i>Reveil</i>. His name was announced in the prospectus with a
      flourish of trumpets, and the Ministry took care that a hundred thousand
      copies should be scattered abroad far and wide. There was a dinner at
      Robert&rsquo;s, two doors away from Frascati&rsquo;s, to celebrate the inauguration,
      and the whole band of Royalist writers for the press were present.
      Martainville was there, and Auger and Destains, and a host of others,
      still living, who &ldquo;did Monarchy and religion,&rdquo; to use the familiar
      expression coined for them. Nathan had also enlisted under the banner, for
      he was thinking of starting a theatre, and not unreasonably held that it
      was better to have the licensing authorities for him than against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will pay the Liberals out,&rdquo; cried Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Nathan, &ldquo;if we are for war, let us have war in earnest;
      we must not carry it on with pop-guns. Let us fall upon all Classicals and
      Liberals without distinction of age or sex, and put them all to the sword
      with ridicule. There must be no quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must act honorably; there must be no bribing with copies of books or
      presents; no taking money of publishers. We must inaugurate a Restoration
      of Journalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Martainville. &ldquo;<i>Justum et tenacem propositi virum</i>! Let
      us be implacable and virulent. I will give out La Fayette for the prince
      of harlequins that he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will undertake the heroes of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>,&rdquo; added
      Lucien; &ldquo;Sergeant Mercier, M. Jouy&rsquo;s Complete Works, and &lsquo;the illustrious
      orators of the Left.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A war of extermination was unanimously resolved upon, and by one o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning all shades of opinion were merged and drowned, together
      with every glimmer of sense, in a flaming bowl of punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a fine Monarchical and Religious jollification,&rdquo; remarked an
      illustrious reveler in the doorway as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      That comment appeared in the next day&rsquo;s issue of the <i>Miroir</i> through
      the good offices of a publisher among the guests, and became historic.
      Lucien was supposed to be the traitor who blabbed. His defection gave the
      signal for a terrific hubbub in the Liberal camp; Lucien was the butt of
      the Opposition newspapers, and ridiculed unmercifully. The whole history
      of his sonnets was given to the public. Dauriat was said to prefer a first
      loss of a thousand crowns to the risk of publishing the verses; Lucien was
      called &ldquo;the Poet sans Sonnets;&rdquo; and one morning, in that very paper in
      which he had so brilliant a beginning, he read the following lines,
      significant enough for him, but barely intelligible to other readers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *** &ldquo;If M. Dauriat persistently withholds the Sonnets of the
  future Petrarch from publication, we will act like generous foes.
  We will open our own columns to his poems, which must be piquant
  indeed, to judge by the following specimen obligingly communicated
  by a friend of the author.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And close upon that ominous preface followed a sonnet entitled &ldquo;The
      Thistle&rdquo; (<i>le Chardon)</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A chance-come seedling, springing up one day
  Among the flowers in a garden fair,
  Made boast that splendid colors bright and rare
  Its claims to lofty lineage should display.

  So for a while they suffered it to stay;
  But with such insolence it flourished there,
  That, out of patience with its braggart&rsquo;s air,
  They bade it prove its claims without delay.

  It bloomed forthwith; but ne&rsquo;er was blundering clown
  Upon the boards more promptly hooted down;
  The sister flowers began to jeer and laugh.

  The owner flung it out. At close of day
  A solitary jackass came to bray&mdash;
  A common Thistle&rsquo;s fitting epitaph.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lucien read the words through scalding tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vernou touched elsewhere on Lucien&rsquo;s gambling propensities, and spoke of
      the forthcoming <i>Archer of Charles IX.</i> as &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo; in its
      tendency, the writer siding with Catholic cut-throats against their
      Calvinist victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another week found the quarrel embittered. Lucien had counted upon his
      friend Etienne; Etienne owed him a thousand francs, and there had been
      besides a private understanding between them; but Etienne Lousteau during
      the interval became his sworn foe, and this was the manner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past three months Nathan had been smitten with Florine&rsquo;s charms,
      and much at a loss how to rid himself of Lousteau his rival, who was in
      fact dependent upon the actress. And now came Nathan&rsquo;s opportunity, when
      Florine was frantic with distress over the failure of the
      Panorama-Dramatique, which left her without an engagement. He went as
      Lucien&rsquo;s colleague to beg Coralie to ask for a part for Florine in a play
      of his which was about to be produced at the Gymnase. Then Nathan went to
      Florine and made capital with her out of the service done by the promise
      of a conditional engagement. Ambition turned Florine&rsquo;s head; she did not
      hesitate. She had had time to gauge Lousteau pretty thoroughly. Lousteau&rsquo;s
      courses were weakening his will, and here was Nathan with his ambitions in
      politics and literature, and energies strong as his cravings. Florine
      proposed to reappear on the stage with renewed eclat, so she handed over
      Matifat&rsquo;s correspondence to Nathan. Nathan drove a bargain for them with
      Matifat, and took the sixth share of Finot&rsquo;s review in exchange for the
      compromising billets. After this, Florine was installed in sumptuously
      furnished apartments in the Rue Hauteville, where she took Nathan for her
      protector in the face of the theatrical and journalistic world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau was terribly overcome. He wept (towards the close of a dinner
      given by his friends to console him in his affliction). In the course of
      that banquet it was decided that Nathan had not acted unfairly; several
      writers present&mdash;Finot and Vernou, for instance,&mdash;knew of
      Florine&rsquo;s fervid admiration for dramatic literature; but they all agreed
      that Lucien had behaved very ill when he arranged that business at the
      Gymnase; he had indeed broken the most sacred laws of friendship.
      Party-spirit and zeal to serve his new friends had led the Royalist poet
      on to sin beyond forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan was carried away by passion,&rdquo; pronounced Bixiou, &ldquo;while this
      &lsquo;distinguished provincial,&rsquo; as Blondet calls him, is simply scheming for
      his own selfish ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it came to pass that deep plots were laid by all parties alike to
      rid themselves of this little upstart intruder of a poet who wanted to eat
      everybody up. Vernou bore Lucien a personal grudge, and undertook to keep
      a tight hand on him; and Finot declared that Lucien had betrayed the
      secret of the combination against Matifat, and thereby swindled him
      (Finot) out of fifty thousand francs. Nathan, acting on Florine&rsquo;s advice,
      gained Finot&rsquo;s support by selling him the sixth share for fifteen thousand
      francs, and Lousteau consequently lost his commission. His thousand crowns
      had vanished away; he could not forgive Lucien for this treacherous blow
      (as he supposed it) dealt to his interests. The wounds of vanity refuse to
      heal if oxide of silver gets into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      No words, no amount of description, can depict the wrath of an author in a
      paroxysm of mortified vanity, nor the energy which he discovers when stung
      by the poisoned darts of sarcasm; but, on the other hand, the man that is
      roused to fighting-fury by a personal attack usually subsides very
      promptly. The more phlegmatic race, who take these things quietly, lay
      their account with the oblivion which speedily overtakes the spiteful
      article. These are the truly courageous men of letters; and if the
      weaklings seem at first to be the strong men, they cannot hold out for any
      length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that first fortnight, while the fury was upon him, Lucien poured a
      perfect hailstorm of articles into the Royalist papers, in which he shared
      the responsibilities of criticism with Hector Merlin. He was always in the
      breach, pounding away with all his might in the <i>Reveil</i>, backed up
      by Martainville, the only one among his associates who stood by him
      without an afterthought. Martainville was not in the secret of certain
      understandings made and ratified amid after-dinner jokes, or at Dauriat&rsquo;s
      in the Wooden Galleries, or behind the scenes at the Vaudeville, when
      journalists of either side met on neutral ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lucien went to the greenroom of the Vaudeville, he met with no
      welcome; the men of his own party held out a hand to shake, the others cut
      him; and all the while Hector Merlin and Theodore Gaillard fraternized
      unblushingly with Finot, Lousteau, and Vernou, and the rest of the
      journalists who were known for &ldquo;good fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The greenroom of the Vaudeville in those days was a hotbed of gossip, as
      well as a neutral ground where men of every shade of opinion could meet;
      so much so that the President of a court of law, after reproving a learned
      brother in a certain council chamber for &ldquo;sweeping the greenroom with his
      gown,&rdquo; met the subject of his strictures, gown to gown, in the greenroom
      of the Vaudeville. Lousteau, in time, shook hands again with Nathan; Finot
      came thither almost every evening; and Lucien, whenever he could spare the
      time, went to the Vaudeville to watch the enemies, who showed no sign of
      relenting towards the unfortunate boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of the Restoration party hatred was far more bitter than in
      our day. Intensity of feeling is diminished in our high-pressure age. The
      critic cuts a book to pieces and shakes hands with the author afterwards,
      and the victim must keep on good terms with his slaughterer, or run the
      gantlet of innumerable jokes at his expense. If he refuses, he is
      unsociable, eaten up with self-love, he is sulky and rancorous, he bears
      malice, he is a bad bed-fellow. To-day let an author receive a treacherous
      stab in the back, let him avoid the snares set for him with base
      hypocrisy, and endure the most unhandsome treatment, he must still
      exchange greetings with his assassin, who, for that matter, claims the
      esteem and friendship of his victim. Everything can be excused and
      justified in an age which has transformed vice into virtue and virtue into
      vice. Good-fellowship has come to be the most sacred of our liberties; the
      representatives of the most opposite opinions courteously blunt the edge
      of their words, and fence with buttoned foils. But in those almost
      forgotten days the same theatre could scarcely hold certain Royalist and
      Liberal journalists; the most malignant provocation was offered, glances
      were like pistol-shots, the least spark produced an explosion of quarrel.
      Who has not heard his neighbor&rsquo;s half-smothered oath on the entrance of
      some man in the forefront of the battle on the opposing side? There were
      but two parties&mdash;Royalists and Liberals, Classics and Romantics. You
      found the same hatred masquerading in either form, and no longer wondered
      at the scaffolds of the Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien had been a Liberal and a hot Voltairean; now he was a rabid
      Royalist and a Romantic. Martainville, the only one among his colleagues
      who really liked him and stood by him loyally, was more hated by the
      Liberals than any man on the Royalist side, and this fact drew down all
      the hate of the Liberals on Lucien&rsquo;s head. Martainville&rsquo;s staunch
      friendship injured Lucien. Political parties show scanty gratitude to
      outpost sentinels, and leave leaders of forlorn hopes to their fate; &lsquo;tis
      a rule of warfare which holds equally good in matters political, to keep
      with the main body of the army if you mean to succeed. The spite of the
      small Liberal papers fastened at once on the opportunity of coupling the
      two names, and flung them into each other&rsquo;s arms. Their friendship, real
      or imaginary, brought down upon them both a series of articles written by
      pens dipped in gall. Felicien Vernou was furious with jealousy of Lucien&rsquo;s
      social success; and believed, like all his old associates, in the poet&rsquo;s
      approaching elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiction of Lucien&rsquo;s treason was embellished with every kind of
      aggravating circumstance; he was called Judas the Less, Martainville being
      Judas the Great, for Martainville was supposed (rightly or wrongly) to
      have given up the Bridge of Pecq to the foreign invaders. Lucien said
      jestingly to des Lupeaulx that he himself, surely, had given up the Asses&rsquo; 
      Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s luxurious life, hollow though it was, and founded on
      expectations, had estranged his friends. They could not forgive him for
      the carriage which he had put down&mdash;for them he was still rolling
      about in it&mdash;nor yet for the splendors of the Rue de Vendome which he
      had left. All of them felt instinctively that nothing was beyond the reach
      of this young and handsome poet, with intellect enough and to spare; they
      themselves had trained him in corruption; and, therefore, they left no
      stone unturned to ruin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few days before Coralie&rsquo;s first appearance at the Gymnase, Lucien and
      Hector Merlin went arm-in-arm to the Vaudeville. Merlin was scolding his
      friend for giving a helping hand to Nathan in Florine&rsquo;s affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You then and there made two mortal enemies of Lousteau and Nathan,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I gave you good advice, and you took no notice of it. You gave
      praise, you did them a good turn&mdash;you will be well punished for your
      kindness. Florine and Coralie will never live in peace on the same stage;
      both will wish to be first. You can only defend Coralie in our papers; and
      Nathan not only has a pull as a dramatic author, he can control the
      dramatic criticism in the Liberal newspapers. He has been a journalist a
      little longer than you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words responded to Lucien&rsquo;s inward misgivings. Neither Nathan nor
      Gaillard was treating him with the frankness which he had a right to
      expect, but so new a convert could hardly complain. Gaillard utterly
      confounded Lucien by saying roundly that newcomers must give proofs of
      their sincerity for some time before their party could trust them. There
      was more jealousy than he had imagined in the inner circles of Royalist
      and Ministerial journalism. The jealousy of curs fighting for a bone is
      apt to appear in the human species when there is a loaf to divide; there
      is the same growling and showing of teeth, the same characteristics come
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every possible way these writers of articles tried to injure each other
      with those in power; they brought reciprocal accusations of lukewarm zeal;
      they invented the most treacherous ways of getting rid of a rival. There
      had been none of this internecine warfare among the Liberals; they were
      too far from power, too hopelessly out of favor; and Lucien, amid the
      inextricable tangle of ambitions, had neither the courage to draw sword
      and cut the knot, or the patience to unravel it. He could not be the
      Beaumarchais, the Aretino, the Freron of his epoch; he was not made of
      such stuff; he thought of nothing but his one desire, the patent of
      nobility; for he saw clearly that for him such a restoration meant a
      wealthy marriage, and, the title once secured, chance and his good looks
      would do the rest. This was all his plan, and Etienne Lousteau, who had
      confided so much to him, knew his secret, knew how to deal a deathblow to
      the poet of Angouleme. That very night, as Lucien and Merlin went to the
      Vaudeville, Etienne had laid a terrible trap, into which an inexperienced
      boy could not but fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is our handsome Lucien,&rdquo; said Finot, drawing des Lupeaulx in the
      direction of the poet, and shaking hands with feline amiability. &ldquo;I cannot
      think of another example of such rapid success,&rdquo; continued Finot, looking
      from des Lupeaulx to Lucien. &ldquo;There are two sorts of success in Paris:
      there is a fortune in solid cash, which any one can amass, and there is
      the intangible fortune of connections, position, or a footing in certain
      circles inaccessible for certain persons, however rich they may be. Now my
      friend here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; interposed des Lupeaulx, smiling blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; repeated Finot, patting Lucien&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;has made a brilliant
      success from this point of view. Truth to tell, Lucien has more in him,
      more gift, more wit than the rest of us that envy him, and he is
      enchantingly handsome besides; his old friends cannot forgive him for his
      success&mdash;they call it luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luck of that sort never comes to fools or incapables,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx.
      &ldquo;Can you call Bonaparte&rsquo;s fortune luck, eh? There were a score of
      applicants for the command of the army in Italy, just as there are a
      hundred young men at this moment who would like to have an entrance to
      Mlle. des Touches&rsquo; house; people are coupling her name with yours already
      in society, my dear boy,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx, clapping Lucien on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;Ah! you are in high favor. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and
      Mme. de Montcornet are wild about you. You are going to Mme. Firmiani&rsquo;s
      party to-night, are you not, and to the Duchesse de Grandlieu&rsquo;s rout
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to introduce a young banker to you, a M. du Tillet; you ought to
      be acquainted, he has contrived to make a great fortune in a short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien and du Tillet bowed, and entered into conversation, and the banker
      asked Lucien to dinner. Finot and des Lupeaulx, a well-matched pair, knew
      each other well enough to keep upon good terms; they turned away to
      continue their chat on one of the sofas in the greenroom, and left Lucien
      with du Tillet, Merlin, and Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, my friend,&rdquo; said Finot, &ldquo;tell me how things stand. Is there
      really somebody behind Lucien? For he is the <i>bete noire</i> of my
      staff; and before allowing them to plot against him, I thought I should
      like to know whether, in your opinion, it would be better to baffle them
      and keep well with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Master of Requests and Finot looked at each other very closely for a
      moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx, &ldquo;how can you imagine that the
      Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, or Chatelet, or Mme. de Bargeton&mdash;who has procured
      the Baron&rsquo;s nomination to the prefecture and the title of Count, so as to
      return in triumph to Angouleme&mdash;how can you suppose that any of them
      will forgive Lucien for his attacks on them? They dropped him down in the
      Royalist ranks to crush him out of existence. At this moment they are
      looking round for any excuse for not fulfilling the promises they made to
      that boy. Help them to some; you will do the greatest possible service to
      the two women, and some day or other they will remember it. I am in their
      secrets; I was surprised to find how much they hated the little fellow.
      This Lucien might have rid himself of his bitterest enemy (Mme. de
      Bargeton) by desisting from his attacks on terms which a woman loves to
      grant&mdash;do you take me? He is young and handsome, he should have
      drowned her hate in torrents of love, he would be Comte de Rubempre by
      this time; the Cuttlefish-bone would have obtained some sinecure for him,
      some post in the Royal Household. Lucien would have made a very pretty
      reader to Louis XVIII.; he might have been librarian somewhere or other,
      Master of Requests for a joke, Master of Revels, what you please. The
      young fool has missed his chance. Perhaps that is his unpardonable sin.
      Instead of imposing his conditions, he has accepted them. When Lucien was
      caught with the bait of the patent of nobility, the Baron Chatelet made a
      great step. Coralie has been the ruin of that boy. If he had not had the
      actress for his mistress, he would have turned again to the
      Cuttlefish-bone; and he would have had her too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we can knock him over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; des Lupeaulx asked carelessly. He saw a way of gaining credit with
      the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard for this service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is under contract to write for Lousteau&rsquo;s paper, and we can the better
      hold him to his agreement because he has not a sou. If we tickle up the
      Keeper of the Seals with a facetious article, and prove that Lucien wrote
      it, he will consider that Lucien is unworthy of the King&rsquo;s favor. We have
      a plot on hand besides. Coralie will be ruined, and our distinguished
      provincial will lose his head when his mistress is hissed off the stage
      and left without an engagement. When once the patent is suspended, we will
      laugh at the victim&rsquo;s aristocratic pretensions, and allude to his mother
      the nurse and his father the apothecary. Lucien&rsquo;s courage is only
      skindeep, he will collapse; we will send him back to his provinces. Nathan
      made Florine sell me Matifat&rsquo;s sixth share of the review, I was able to
      buy; Dauriat and I are the only proprietors now; we might come to an
      understanding, you and I, and the review might be taken over for the
      benefit of the Court. I stipulated for the restitution of my sixth before
      I undertook to protect Nathan and Florine; they let me have it, and I must
      help them; but I wished to know first how Lucien stood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve your name,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx. &ldquo;I like a man of your sort&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then can you arrange a definite engagement for Florine?&rdquo; asked
      Finot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but rid us of Lucien, for Rastignac and de Marsay never wish to hear
      of him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep in peace,&rdquo; returned Finot. &ldquo;Nathan and Merlin will always have
      articles ready for Gaillard, who will promise to take them; Lucien will
      never get a line into the paper. We will cut off his supplies. There is
      only Martainville&rsquo;s paper left him in which to defend himself and Coralie;
      what can a single paper do against so many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let you know the weak points of the Ministry; but get Lucien to
      write that article and hand over the manuscript,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx, who
      refrained carefully from informing Finot that Lucien&rsquo;s promised patent was
      nothing but a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      When des Lupeaulx had gone, Finot went to Lucien, and taking the
      good-natured tone which deceives so many victims, he explained that he
      could not possibly afford to lose his contributor, and at the same time he
      shrank from taking proceedings which might ruin him with his friends of
      the other side. Finot himself liked a man who was strong enough to change
      his opinions. They were pretty sure to come across one another, he and
      Lucien, and might be mutually helpful in a thousand little ways. Lucien,
      besides, needed a sure man in the Liberal party to attack the Ultras and
      men in office who might refuse to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose that they play you false, what will you do?&rdquo; Finot ended.
      &ldquo;Suppose that some Minister fancies that he has you fast by the halter of
      your apostasy, and turns the cold shoulder on you? You will be glad to set
      on a few dogs to snap at his legs, will you not? Very well. But you have
      made a deadly enemy of Lousteau; he is thirsting for your blood. You and
      Felicien are not on speaking terms. I only remain to you. It is a rule of
      the craft to keep a good understanding with every man of real ability. In
      the world which you are about to enter you can do me services in return
      for mine with the press. But business first. Let me have purely literary
      articles; they will not compromise you, and we shall have executed our
      agreement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien saw nothing but good-fellowship and a shrewd eye to business in
      Finot&rsquo;s offer; Finot and des Lupeaulx had flattered him, and he was in a
      good humor. He actually thanked Finot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambitious men, like all those who can only make their way by the help of
      others and of circumstances, are bound to lay their plans very carefully
      and to adhere very closely to the course of conduct on which they
      determine; it is a cruel moment in the lives of such aspirants when some
      unknown power brings the fabric of their fortunes to some severe test and
      everything gives way at once; threads are snapped or entangled, and
      misfortune appears on every side. Let a man lose his head in the
      confusion, it is all over with him; but if he can resist this first revolt
      of circumstances, if he can stand erect until the tempest passes over, or
      make a supreme effort and reach the serene sphere about the storm&mdash;then
      he is really strong. To every man, unless he is born rich, there comes
      sooner or later &ldquo;his fatal week,&rdquo; as it must be called. For Napoleon, for
      instance, that week was the Retreat from Moscow. It had begun now for
      Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social and literary success had come to him too easily; he had had such
      luck that he was bound to know reverses and to see men and circumstances
      turn against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first blow was the heaviest and the most keenly felt, for it touched
      Lucien where he thought himself invulnerable&mdash;in his heart and his
      love. Coralie might not be clever, but hers was a noble nature, and she
      possessed the great actress&rsquo; faculty of suddenly standing aloof from self.
      This strange phenomenon is subject, until it degenerates into a habit with
      long practice, to the caprices of character, and not seldom to an
      admirable delicacy of feeling in actresses who are still young. Coralie,
      to all appearance bold and wanton, as the part required, was in reality
      girlish and timid, and love had wrought in her a revulsion of her woman&rsquo;s
      heart against the comedian&rsquo;s mask. Art, the supreme art of feigning
      passion and feeling, had not yet triumphed over nature in her; she shrank
      before a great audience from the utterance that belongs to Love alone; and
      Coralie suffered besides from another true woman&rsquo;s weakness&mdash;she
      needed success, born stage queen though she was. She could not confront an
      audience with which she was out of sympathy; she was nervous when she
      appeared on the stage, a cold reception paralyzed her. Each new part gave
      her the terrible sensations of a first appearance. Applause produced a
      sort of intoxication which gave her encouragement without flattering her
      vanity; at a murmur of dissatisfaction or before a silent house, she
      flagged; but a great audience following attentively, admiringly, willing
      to be pleased, electrified Coralie. She felt at once in communication with
      the nobler qualities of all those listeners; she felt that she possessed
      the power of stirring their souls and carrying them with her. But if this
      action and reaction of the audience upon the actress reveals the nervous
      organization of genius, it shows no less clearly the poor child&rsquo;s
      sensitiveness and delicacy. Lucien had discovered the treasures of her
      nature; had learned in the past months that this woman who loved him was
      still so much of a girl. And Coralie was unskilled in the wiles of an
      actress&mdash;she could not fight her own battles nor protect herself
      against the machinations of jealousy behind the scenes. Florine was
      jealous of her, and Florine was as dangerous and depraved as Coralie was
      simple and generous. Roles must come to find Coralie; she was too proud to
      implore authors or to submit to dishonoring conditions; she would not give
      herself to the first journalist who persecuted her with his advances and
      threatened her with his pen. Genius is rare enough in the extraordinary
      art of the stage; but genius is only one condition of success among many,
      and is positively hurtful unless it is accompanied by a genius for
      intrigue in which Coralie was utterly lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien knew how much his friend would suffer on her first appearance at
      the Gymnase, and was anxious at all costs to obtain a success for her; but
      all the money remaining from the sale of the furniture and all Lucien&rsquo;s
      earnings had been sunk in costumes, in the furniture of a dressing-room,
      and the expenses of a first appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, Lucien made up his mind to a humiliating step for love&rsquo;s
      sake. He took Fendant and Cavalier&rsquo;s bills, and went to the <i>Golden
      Cocoon</i> in the Rue des Bourdonnais. He would ask Camusot to discount
      them. The poet had not fallen so low that he could make this attempt quite
      coolly. There had been many a sharp struggle first, and the way to that
      decision had been paved with many dreadful thoughts. Nevertheless, he
      arrived at last in the dark, cheerless little private office that looked
      out upon a yard, and found Camusot seated gravely there; this was not
      Coralie&rsquo;s infatuated adorer, not the easy-natured, indolent, incredulous
      libertine whom he had known hitherto as Camusot, but a heavy father of a
      family, a merchant grown old in shrewd expedients of business and
      respectable virtues, wearing a magistrate&rsquo;s mask of judicial prudery; this
      Camusot was the cool, business-like head of the firm surrounded by clerks,
      green cardboard boxes, pigeonholes, invoices, and samples, and fortified
      by the presence of a wife and a plainly-dressed daughter. Lucien trembled
      from head to foot as he approached; for the worthy merchant, like the
      money-lenders, turned cool, indifferent eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are two or three bills, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, standing beside the
      merchant, who did not rise from his desk. &ldquo;If you will take them of me,
      you will oblige me extremely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken something of <i>me</i>, monsieur,&rdquo; said Camusot; &ldquo;I do not
      forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this, Lucien explained Coralie&rsquo;s predicament. He spoke in a low voice,
      bending to murmur his explanation, so that Camusot could hear the heavy
      throbbing of the humiliated poet&rsquo;s heart. It was no part of Camusot&rsquo;s
      plans that Coralie should suffer a check. He listened, smiling to himself
      over the signatures on the bills (for, as a judge at the Tribunal of
      Commerce, he knew how the booksellers stood), but in the end he gave
      Lucien four thousand five hundred francs for them, stipulating that he
      should add the formula &ldquo;For value received in silks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went straight to Braulard, and made arrangements for a good
      reception. Braulard promised to come to the dress-rehearsal, to determine
      on the points where his &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; should work their fleshy clappers to
      bring down the house in applause. Lucien gave the rest of the money to
      Coralie (he did not tell her how he had come by it), and allayed her
      anxieties and the fears of Berenice, who was sorely troubled over their
      daily expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martainville came several times to hear Coralie rehearse, and he knew more
      of the stage than most men of his time; several Royalist writers had
      promised favorable articles; Lucien had not a suspicion of the impending
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fatal event occurred on the evening before Coralie&rsquo;s <i>debut</i>.
      D&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s book had appeared; and the editor of Merlin&rsquo;s paper,
      considering Lucien to be the best qualified man on the staff, gave him the
      book to review. He owed his unlucky reputation to those articles on
      Nathan&rsquo;s work. There were several men in the office at the time, for all
      the staff had been summoned; Martainville was explaining that the party
      warfare with the Liberals must be waged on certain lines. Nathan, Merlin,
      all the contributors, in fact, were talking of Leon Giraud&rsquo;s paper, and
      remarking that its influence was the more pernicious because the language
      was guarded, cool, moderate. People were beginning to speak of the circle
      in the Rue des Quatre-Vents as a second Convention. It had been decided
      that the Royalist papers were to wage a systematic war of extermination
      against these dangerous opponents, who, indeed, at a later day, were
      destined to sow the doctrines that drove the Bourbons into exile; but that
      was only after the most brilliant of Royalist writers had joined them for
      the sake of a mean revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s absolutist opinions were not known; it was taken for granted
      that he shared the views of his clique, he fell under the same anathema,
      and he was to be the first victim. His book was to be honored with &ldquo;a
      slashing article,&rdquo; to use the consecrated formula. Lucien refused to write
      the article. Great was the commotion among the leading Royalist writers
      thus met in conclave. Lucien was told plainly that a renegade could not do
      as he pleased; if it did not suit his views to take the side of the
      Monarchy and Religion, he could go back to the other camp. Merlin and
      Martainville took him aside and begged him, as his friends, to remember
      that he would simply hand Coralie over to the tender mercies of the
      Liberal papers, for she would find no champions on the Royalist and
      Ministerial side. Her acting was certain to provoke a hot battle, and the
      kind of discussion which every actress longs to arouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand it in the least,&rdquo; said Martainville; &ldquo;if she plays
      for three months amid a cross-fire of criticism, she will make thirty
      thousand francs when she goes on tour in the provinces at the end of the
      season; and here are you about to sacrifice Coralie and your own future,
      and to quarrel with your own bread and butter, all for a scruple that will
      always stand in your way, and ought to be got rid of at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien was forced to choose between d&rsquo;Arthez and Coralie. His mistress
      would be ruined unless he dealt his friend a death-blow in the <i>Reveil</i>
      and the great newspaper. Poor poet! He went home with death in his soul;
      and by the fireside he sat and read that finest production of modern
      literature. Tears fell fast over it as the pages turned. For a long while
      he hesitated, but at last he took up the pen and wrote a sarcastic article
      of the kind that he understood so well, taking the book as children might
      take some bright bird to strip it of its plumage and torture it. His
      sardonic jests were sure to tell. Again he turned to the book, and as he
      read it over a second time, his better self awoke. In the dead of night he
      hurried across Paris, and stood outside d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s house. He looked up at
      the windows and saw the faint pure gleam of light in the panes, as he had
      so often seen it, with a feeling of admiration for the noble steadfastness
      of that truly great nature. For some moments he stood irresolute on the
      curbstone; he had not courage to go further; but his good angel urged him
      on. He tapped at the door and opened, and found d&rsquo;Arthez sitting reading
      in a fireless room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Arthez, for news of some dreadful kind was
      visible in Lucien&rsquo;s ghastly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your book is sublime, d&rsquo;Arthez,&rdquo; said Lucien, with tears in his eyes,
      &ldquo;and they have ordered me to write an attack upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! the bread that they give you is hard indeed!&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only ask for one favor, keep my visit a secret and leave me to my hell,
      to the occupations of the damned. Perhaps it is impossible to attain to
      success until the heart is seared and callous in every most sensitive
      spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as ever!&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think me a base poltroon? No, d&rsquo;Arthez; no, I am a boy half crazed
      with love,&rdquo; and he told his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us look at the article,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez, touched by all that Lucien
      said of Coralie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien held out the manuscript; d&rsquo;Arthez read, and could not help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a fatal waste of intellect!&rdquo; he began. But at the sight of
      Lucien overcome with grief in the opposite armchair, he checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave it with me to correct? I will let you have it again
      to-morrow,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Flippancy depreciates a work; serious and
      conscientious criticism is sometimes praise in itself. I know a way to
      make your article more honorable both for yourself and for me. Besides, I
      know my faults well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you climb a hot, shadowless hillside, you sometimes find fruit to
      quench your torturing thirst; and I have found it here and now,&rdquo; said
      Lucien, as he sprang sobbing to d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s arms and kissed his friend on
      the forehead. &ldquo;It seems to me that I am leaving my conscience in your
      keeping; some day I will come to you and ask for it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look upon a periodical repentance as great hypocrisy,&rdquo; d&rsquo;Arthez said
      solemnly; &ldquo;repentance becomes a sort of indemnity for wrongdoing.
      Repentance is virginity of the soul, which we must keep for God; a man who
      repents twice is a horrible sycophant. I am afraid that you regard
      repentance as absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went slowly back to the Rue de la Lune, stricken dumb by those
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning d&rsquo;Arthez sent back his article, recast throughout, and Lucien
      sent it in to the review; but from that day melancholy preyed upon him,
      and he could not always disguise his mood. That evening, when the theatre
      was full, he experienced for the first time the paroxysm of nervous terror
      caused by a <i>debut</i>; terror aggravated in his case by all the
      strength of his love. Vanity of every kind was involved. He looked over
      the rows of faces as a criminal eyes the judges and the jury on whom his
      life depends. A murmur would have set him quivering; any slight incident
      upon the stage, Coralie&rsquo;s exits and entrances, the slightest modulation of
      the tones of her voice, would perturb him beyond all reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play in which Coralie made her first appearance at the Gymnase was a
      piece of the kind which sometimes falls flat at first, and afterwards has
      immense success. It fell flat that night. Coralie was not applauded when
      she came on, and the chilly reception reacted upon her. The only applause
      came from Camusot&rsquo;s box, and various persons posted in the balcony and
      galleries silenced Camusot with repeated cries of &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; The galleries
      even silenced the <i>claqueurs</i> when they led off with exaggerated
      salvos. Martainville applauded bravely; Nathan, Merlin, and the
      treacherous Florine followed his example; but it was clear that the piece
      was a failure. A crowd gathered in Coralie&rsquo;s dressing-room and consoled
      her, till she had no courage left. She went home in despair, less for her
      own sake than for Lucien&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Braulard has betrayed us,&rdquo; Lucien said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie was heartstricken. The next day found her in a high fever, utterly
      unfit to play, face to face with the thought that she had been cut short
      in her career. Lucien hid the papers from her, and looked them over in the
      dining-room. The reviewers one and all attributed the failure of the piece
      to Coralie; she had overestimated her strength; she might be the delight
      of a boulevard audience, but she was out of her element at the Gymnase;
      she had been inspired by a laudable ambition, but she had not taken her
      powers into account; she had chosen a part to which she was quite unequal.
      Lucien read on through a pile of penny-a-lining, put together on the same
      system as his attack upon Nathan. Milo of Crotona, when he found his hands
      fast in the oak which he himself had cleft, was not more furious than
      Lucien. He grew haggard with rage. His friends gave Coralie the most
      treacherous advice, in the language of kindly counsel and friendly
      interest. She should play (according to these authorities) all kind of
      roles, which the treacherous writers of these unblushing <i>feuilletons</i>
      knew to be utterly unsuited to her genius. And these were the Royalist
      papers, led off by Nathan. As for the Liberal press, all the weapons which
      Lucien had used were now turned against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie heard a sob, followed by another and another. She sprang out of
      bed to find Lucien, and saw the papers. Nothing would satisfy her but she
      must read them all; and when she had read them, she went back to bed, and
      lay there in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine was in the plot; she had foreseen the outcome; she had studied
      Coralie&rsquo;s part, and was ready to take her place. The management, unwilling
      to give up the piece, was ready to take Florine in Coralie&rsquo;s stead. When
      the manager came, he found poor Coralie sobbing and exhausted on her bed;
      but when he began to say, in Lucien&rsquo;s presence, that Florine knew the
      part, and that the play must be given that evening, Coralie sprang up at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will play!&rdquo; she cried, and sank fainting on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Florine took the part, and made her reputation in it; for the piece
      succeeded, the newspapers all sang her praises, and from that time forth
      Florine was the great actress whom we all know. Florine&rsquo;s success
      exasperated Lucien to the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wretched girl, whom you helped to earn her bread! If the Gymnase
      prefers to do so, let the management pay you to cancel your engagement. I
      shall be the Comte de Rubempre; I will make my fortune, and you shall be
      my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Coralie, looking at him with wan eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;Very well, wait a few days, and you shall live
      in a fine house, you shall have a carriage, and I will write a part for
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took two thousand francs and hurried to Frascati&rsquo;s. For seven hours the
      unhappy victim of the Furies watched his varying luck, and outwardly
      seemed cool and self-contained. He experienced both extremes of fortune
      during that day and part of the night that followed; at one time he
      possessed as much as thirty thousand francs, and he came out at last
      without a sou. In the Rue de la Lune he found Finot waiting for him with a
      request for one of his short articles. Lucien so far forgot himself, that
      he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not all rosy,&rdquo; returned Finot. &ldquo;You made your right-about-face
      in such a way that you were bound to lose the support of the Liberal
      press, and the Liberals are far stronger in print than all the
      Ministerialist and Royalist papers put together. A man should never leave
      one camp for another until he has made a comfortable berth for himself, by
      way of consolation for the losses that he must expect; and in any case, a
      prudent politician will see his friends first, and give them his reasons
      for going over, and take their opinions. You can still act together; they
      sympathize with you, and you agree to give mutual help. Nathan and Merlin
      did that before they went over. Hawks don&rsquo;t pike out hawks&rsquo; eyes. You were
      as innocent as a lamb; you will be forced to show your teeth to your new
      party to make anything out of them. You have been necessarily sacrificed
      to Nathan. I cannot conceal from you that your article on d&rsquo;Arthez has
      roused a terrific hubbub. Marat is a saint compared with you. You will be
      attacked, and your book will be a failure. How far have things gone with
      your romance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the last proof sheets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the anonymous articles against that young d&rsquo;Arthez in the
      Ministerialist and Ultra papers are set down to you. The <i>Reveil</i> is
      poking fun at the set in the Rue des Quatre-Vents, and the hits are the
      more telling because they are funny. There is a whole serious political
      coterie at the back of Leon Giraud&rsquo;s paper; they will come into power too,
      sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not written a line in the <i>Reveil</i> this week past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Keep my short articles in mind. Write fifty of them straight
      off, and I will pay you for them in a lump; but they must be of the same
      color as the paper.&rdquo; And Finot, with seeming carelessness, gave Lucien an
      edifying anecdote of the Keeper of the Seals, a piece of current gossip,
      he said, for the subject of one of the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager to retrieve his losses at play, Lucien shook off his dejection,
      summoned up his energy and youthful force, and wrote thirty articles of
      two columns each. These finished, he went to Dauriat&rsquo;s, partly because he
      felt sure of meeting Finot there, and he wished to give the articles to
      Finot in person; partly because he wished for an explanation of the
      non-appearance of the <i>Marguerites</i>. He found the bookseller&rsquo;s shop
      full of his enemies. All the talk immediately ceased as he entered. Put
      under the ban of journalism, his courage rose, and once more he said to
      himself, as he had said in the alley at the Luxembourg, &ldquo;I will triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dauriat was neither amiable or inclined to patronize; he was sarcastic in
      tone, and determined not to bate an inch of his rights. The <i>Marguerites</i>
      should appear when it suited his purpose; he should wait until Lucien was
      in a position to secure the success of the book; it was his, he had bought
      it outright. When Lucien asserted that Dauriat was bound to publish the <i>Marguerites</i>
      by the very nature of the contract, and the relative positions of the
      parties to the agreement, Dauriat flatly contradicted him, said that no
      publisher could be compelled by law to publish at a loss, and that he
      himself was the best judge of the expediency of producing the book. There
      was, besides, a remedy open to Lucien, as any court of law would admit&mdash;the
      poet was quite welcome to take his verses to a Royalist publisher upon the
      repayment of the thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went away. Dauriat&rsquo;s moderate tone had exasperated him even more
      than his previous arrogance at their first interview. So the <i>Marguerites</i>
      would not appear until Lucien had found a host of formidable supporters,
      or grown formidable himself! He walked home slowly, so oppressed and out
      of heart that he felt ready for suicide. Coralie lay in bed, looking white
      and ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have a part, or she will die,&rdquo; said Berenice, as Lucien dressed
      for a great evening party at Mlle. des Touches&rsquo; house in the Rue du Mont
      Blanc. Des Lupeaulx and Vignon and Blondet were to be there, as well as
      Mme. d&rsquo;Espard and Mme. de Bargeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was given in honor of Conti, the great composer, owner likewise
      of one of the most famous voices off the stage, Cinti, Pasta, Garcia,
      Levasseur, and two or three celebrated amateurs in society not excepted.
      Lucien saw the Marquise, her cousin, and Mme. de Montcornet sitting
      together, and made one of the party. The unhappy young fellow to all
      appearances was light-hearted, happy, and content; he jested, he was the
      Lucien de Rubempre of his days of splendor, he would not seem to need help
      from any one. He dwelt on his services to the Royalist party, and cited
      the hue and cry raised after him by the Liberal press as a proof of his
      zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be well rewarded, my friend,&rdquo; said Mme. de Bargeton, with a
      gracious smile. &ldquo;Go to the <i>Chancellerie</i> the day after to-morrow
      with &lsquo;the Heron&rsquo; and des Lupeaulx, and you will find your patent signed by
      His Majesty. The Keeper of the Seals will take it to-morrow to the
      Tuileries, but there is to be a meeting of the Council, and he will not
      come back till late. Still, if I hear the result to-morrow evening, I will
      let you know. Where are you living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come to you,&rdquo; said Lucien, ashamed to confess that he was living
      in the Rue de la Lune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duc de Lenoncourt and the Duc de Navarreins have made mention of you
      to the King,&rdquo; added the Marquise; &ldquo;they praised your absolute and entire
      devotion, and said that some distinction ought to avenge your treatment in
      the Liberal press. The name and title of Rubempre, to which you have a
      claim through your mother, would become illustrious through you, they
      said. The King gave his lordship instructions that evening to prepare a
      patent authorizing the Sieur Lucien Chardon to bear the arms and title of
      the Comtes de Rubempre, as grandson of the last Count by the mother&rsquo;s
      side. &lsquo;Let us favor the songsters&rsquo; (<i>chardonnerets</i>) &lsquo;of Pindus,&rsquo; 
      said his Majesty, after reading your sonnet on the Lily, which my cousin
      luckily remembered to give the Duke.&mdash;&lsquo;Especially when the King can
      work miracles, and change the song-bird into an eagle,&rsquo; M. de Navarreins
      replied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien&rsquo;s expansion of feeling would have softened the heart of any woman
      less deeply wounded than Louise d&rsquo;Espard de Negrepelisse; but her thirst
      for vengeance was only increased by Lucien&rsquo;s graciousness. Des Lupeaulx
      was right; Lucien was wanting in tact. It never crossed his mind that this
      history of the patent was one of the mystifications at which Mme. d&rsquo;Espard
      was an adept. Emboldened with success and the flattering distinction shown
      to him by Mlle. des Touches, he stayed till two o&rsquo;clock in the morning for
      a word in private with his hostess. Lucien had learned in Royalist
      newspaper offices that Mlle. des Touches was the author of a play in which
      <i>La petite Fay</i>, the marvel of the moment was about to appear. As the
      rooms emptied, he drew Mlle. des Touches to a sofa in the boudoir, and
      told the story of Coralie&rsquo;s misfortune and his own so touchingly, that
      Mlle. des Touches promised to give the heroine&rsquo;s part to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      That promise put new life into Coralie. But the next day, as they
      breakfasted together, Lucien opened Lousteau&rsquo;s newspaper, and found that
      unlucky anecdote of the Keeper of the Seals and his wife. The story was
      full of the blackest malice lurking in the most caustic wit. Louis XVIII.
      was brought into the story in a masterly fashion, and held up to ridicule
      in such a way that prosecution was impossible. Here is the substance of a
      fiction for which the Liberal party attempted to win credence, though they
      only succeeded in adding one more to the tale of their ingenious
      calumnies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s passion for pink-scented notes and a correspondence full of
      madrigals and sparkling wit was declared to be the last phase of the
      tender passion; love had reached the Doctrinaire stage; or had passed, in
      other words, from the concrete to the abstract. The illustrious lady, so
      cruelly ridiculed under the name of Octavie by Beranger, had conceived (so
      it was said) the gravest fears. The correspondence was languishing. The
      more Octavie displayed her wit, the cooler grew the royal lover. At last
      Octavie discovered the cause of her decline; her power was threatened by
      the novelty and piquancy of a correspondence between the august scribe and
      the wife of his Keeper of the Seals. That excellent woman was believed to
      be incapable of writing a note; she was simply and solely godmother to the
      efforts of audacious ambition. Who could be hidden behind her petticoats?
      Octavie decided, after making observations of her own, that the King was
      corresponding with his Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her plans. With the help of a faithful friend, she arranged that
      a stormy debate should detain the Minister at the Chamber; then she
      contrived to secure a <i>tete-a-tete</i>, and to convince outraged Majesty
      of the fraud. Louis XVIII. flew into a royal and truly Bourbon passion,
      but the tempest broke on Octavie&rsquo;s head. He would not believe her. Octavie
      offered immediate proof, begging the King to write a note which must be
      answered at once. The unlucky wife of the Keeper of the Seals sent to the
      Chamber for her husband; but precautions had been taken, and at that
      moment the Minister was on his legs addressing the Chamber. The lady
      racked her brains and replied to the note with such intellect as she could
      improvise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Chancellor will supply the rest,&rdquo; cried Octavie, laughing at the
      King&rsquo;s chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a word of truth in the story; but it struck home to three
      persons&mdash;the Keeper of the Seals, his wife, and the King. It was said
      that des Lupeaulx had invented the tale, but Finot always kept his
      counsel. The article was caustic and clever, the Liberal papers and the
      Orleanists were delighted with it, and Lucien himself laughed, and thought
      of it merely as a very amusing <i>canard</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called next day for des Lupeaulx and the Baron du Chatelet. The Baron
      had just been to thank his lordship. The Sieur Chatelet, newly appointed
      Councillor Extraordinary, was now Comte du Chatelet, with a promise of the
      prefecture of the Charente so soon as the present prefect should have
      completed the term of office necessary to receive the maximum retiring
      pension. The Comte <i>du</i> Chatelet (for the <i>du</i> had been inserted
      in the patent) drove with Lucien to the <i>Chancellerie</i>, and treated
      his companion as an equal. But for Lucien&rsquo;s articles, he said, his patent
      would not have been granted so soon; Liberal persecution had been a
      stepping-stone to advancement. Des Lupeaulx was waiting for them in the
      Secretary-General&rsquo;s office. That functionary started with surprise when
      Lucien appeared and looked at des Lupeaulx.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, to Lucien&rsquo;s utter bewilderment. &ldquo;Do you dare to come
      here, sir? Your patent was made out, but his lordship has torn it up. Here
      it is!&rdquo; (the Secretary-General caught up the first torn sheet that came to
      hand). &ldquo;The Minister wished to discover the author of yesterday&rsquo;s
      atrocious article, and here is the manuscript,&rdquo; added the speaker, holding
      out the sheets of Lucien&rsquo;s article. &ldquo;You call yourself a Royalist, sir,
      and you are on the staff of that detestable paper which turns the
      Minister&rsquo;s hair gray, harasses the Centre, and is dragging the country
      headlong to ruin? You breakfast on the <i>Corsair</i>, the <i>Miroir</i>,
      the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, and the <i>Courier</i>; you dine on the <i>Quotidienne</i>
      and the <i>Reveil</i>, and then sup with Martainville, the worst enemy of
      the Government! Martainville urges the Government on to Absolutist
      measures; he is more likely to bring on another Revolution than if he had
      gone over to the extreme Left. You are a very clever journalist, but you
      will never make a politician. The Minister denounced you to the King, and
      the King was so angry that he scolded M. le Duc de Navarreins, his First
      Gentleman of the Bedchamber. Your enemies will be all the more formidable
      because they have hitherto been your friends. Conduct that one expects
      from an enemy is atrocious in a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, really, my dear fellow, are you a child?&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx. &ldquo;You
      have compromised me. Mme. d&rsquo;Espard, Mme. de Bargeton, and Mme. de
      Montcornet, who were responsible for you, must be furious. The Duke is
      sure to have handed on his annoyance to the Marquise, and the Marquise
      will have scolded her cousin. Keep away from them and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes his lordship&mdash;go!&rdquo; said the Secretary-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went out into the Place Vendome; he was stunned by this bludgeon
      blow. He walked home along the Boulevards trying to think over his
      position. He saw himself a plaything in the hands of envy, treachery, and
      greed. What was he in this world of contending ambitions? A child
      sacrificing everything to the pursuit of pleasure and the gratification of
      vanity; a poet whose thoughts never went beyond the moment, a moth
      flitting from one bright gleaming object to another. He had no definite
      aim; he was the slave of circumstance&mdash;meaning well, doing ill.
      Conscience tortured him remorselessly. And to crown it all, he was
      penniless and exhausted with work and emotion. His articles could not
      compare with Merlin&rsquo;s or Nathan&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked at random, absorbed in these thoughts. As he passed some of the
      reading-rooms which were already lending books as well as newspapers, a
      placard caught his eyes. It was an advertisement of a book with a
      grotesque title, but beneath the announcement he saw his name in brilliant
      letters&mdash;&ldquo;By Lucien Chardon de Rubempre.&rdquo; So his book had come out,
      and he had heard nothing of it! All the newspapers were silent. He stood
      motionless before the placard, his arms hanging at his sides. He did not
      notice a little knot of acquaintances&mdash;Rastignac and de Marsay and
      some other fashionable young men; nor did he see that Michel Chrestien and
      Leon Giraud were coming towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you M. Chardon?&rdquo; It was Michel who spoke, and there was that in the
      sound of his voice that set Lucien&rsquo;s heartstrings vibrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know me?&rdquo; he asked, turning very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel spat in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that as your wages for your article against d&rsquo;Arthez. If everybody
      would do as I do on his own or his friend&rsquo;s behalf, the press would be as
      it ought to be&mdash;a self-respecting and respected priesthood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien staggered back and caught hold of Rastignac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, addressing Rastignac and de Marsay, &ldquo;you will not
      refuse to act as my seconds. But first, I wish to make matters even and
      apology impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck Michel a sudden, unexpected blow in the face. The rest rushed in
      between the Republican and Royalist, to prevent a street brawl. Rastignac
      dragged Lucien off to the Rue Taitbout, only a few steps away from the
      Boulevard de Gand, where this scene took place. It was the hour of dinner,
      or a crowd would have assembled at once. De Marsay came to find Lucien,
      and the pair insisted that he should dine with them at the Cafe Anglais,
      where they drank and made merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a good swordsman?&rdquo; inquired de Marsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had a foil in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fired a pistol in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have luck on your side. You are a formidable antagonist to stand
      up to; you may kill your man,&rdquo; said de Marsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Lucien found Coralie in bed and asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had played without rehearsal in a one-act play, and taken her revenge.
      She had met with genuine applause. Her enemies had not been prepared for
      this step on her part, and her success had determined the manager to give
      her the heroine&rsquo;s part in Camille Maupin&rsquo;s play. He had discovered the
      cause of her apparent failure, and was indignant with Florine and Nathan.
      Coralie should have the protection of the management.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock that morning, Rastignac came for Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of your street my dear fellow, is particularly appropriate for
      your lodgings; you are up in the sky,&rdquo; he said, by way of greeting. &ldquo;Let
      us be first upon the ground on the road to Clignancourt; it is good form,
      and we ought to set them an example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the programme,&rdquo; said de Marsay, as the cab rattled through the
      Faubourg Saint-Denis: &ldquo;You stand up at twenty-five paces, coming nearer,
      till you are only fifteen apart. You have, each of you, five paces to take
      and three shots to fire&mdash;no more. Whatever happens, that must be the
      end of it. We load for your antagonist, and his seconds load for you. The
      weapons were chosen by the four seconds at a gunmaker&rsquo;s. We helped you to
      a chance, I will promise you; horse pistols are to be the weapons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Lucien, life had become a bad dream. He did not care whether he lived
      or died. The courage of suicide helped him in some sort to carry things
      off with a dash of bravado before the spectators. He stood in his place;
      he would not take a step, a piece of recklessness which the others took
      for deliberate calculation. They thought the poet an uncommonly cool hand.
      Michel Chrestien came as far as his limit; both fired twice and at the
      same time, for either party was considered to be equally insulted.
      Michel&rsquo;s first bullet grazed Lucien&rsquo;s chin; Lucien&rsquo;s passed ten feet above
      Chrestien&rsquo;s head. The second shot hit Lucien&rsquo;s coat collar, but the
      buckram lining fortunately saved its wearer. The third bullet struck him
      in the chest, and he dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; asked Michel Chrestien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;he will pull through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse,&rdquo; answered Michel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; so much the worse,&rdquo; said Lucien, as his tears fell fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon the unhappy boy lay in bed in his own room. With untold pains they
      had managed to remove him, but it had taken five hours to bring him to the
      Rue de la Lune. His condition was not dangerous, but precautions were
      necessary lest fever should set in and bring about troublesome
      complications. Coralie choked down her grief and anguish. She sat up with
      him at night through the anxious weeks of his illness, studying her parts
      by his bedside. Lucien was in danger for two long months; and often at the
      theatre Coralie acted her frivolous role with one thought in her heart,
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is dying at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien owed his life to the skill and devotion of a friend whom he had
      grievously hurt. Bianchon had come to tend him after hearing the story of
      the attack from d&rsquo;Arthez, who told it in confidence, and excused the
      unhappy poet. Bianchon suspected that d&rsquo;Arthez was generously trying to
      screen the renegade; but on questioning Lucien during a lucid interval in
      the dangerous nervous fever, he learned that his patient was only
      responsible for the one serious article in Hector Merlin&rsquo;s paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the first month was out, the firm of Fendant and Cavalier filed
      their schedule. Bianchon told Coralie that Lucien must on no account hear
      the news. The famous <i>Archer of Charles IX.</i>, brought out with an
      absurd title, had been a complete failure. Fendant, being anxious to
      realize a little ready money before going into bankruptcy, had sold the
      whole edition (without Cavalier&rsquo;s knowledge) to dealers in printed paper.
      These, in their turn, had disposed of it at a cheap rate to hawkers, and
      Lucien&rsquo;s book at that moment was adorning the bookstalls along the Quays.
      The booksellers on the Quai des Augustins, who had previously taken a
      quantity of copies, now discovered that after this sudden reduction of the
      price they were like to lose heavily on their purchases; the four
      duodecimo volumes, for which they had paid four francs fifty centimes,
      were being given away for fifty sous. Great was the outcry in the trade;
      but the newspapers preserved a profound silence. Barbet had not foreseen
      this &ldquo;clearance;&rdquo; he had a belief in Lucien&rsquo;s abilities; for once he had
      broken his rule and taken two hundred copies. The prospect of a loss drove
      him frantic; the things he said of Lucien were fearful to hear. Then
      Barbet took a heroic resolution. He stocked his copies in a corner of his
      shop, with the obstinacy of greed, and left his competitors to sell their
      wares at a loss. Two years afterwards, when d&rsquo;Arthez&rsquo;s fine preface, the
      merits of the book, and one or two articles by Leon Giraud had raised the
      value of the book, Barbet sold his copies, one by one, at ten francs each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien knew nothing of all this, but Berenice and Coralie could not refuse
      to allow Hector Merlin to see his dying comrade, and Hector Merlin made
      him drink, drop by drop, the whole of the bitter draught brewed by the
      failure of Fendant and Cavalier, made bankrupts by his first ill-fated
      book. Martainville, the one friend who stood by Lucien through thick and
      thin, had written a magnificent article on his work; but so great was the
      general exasperation against the editor of <i>L&rsquo;Aristarque</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Oriflamme</i>,
      and <i>Le Drapeau Blanc</i>, that his championship only injured Lucien. In
      vain did the athlete return the Liberal insults tenfold, not a newspaper
      took up the challenge in spite of all his attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coralie, Berenice, and Bianchon might shut the door on Lucien&rsquo;s so-called
      friends, who raised a great outcry, but it was impossible to keep out
      creditors and writs. After the failure of Fendant and Cavalier, their
      bills were taken into bankruptcy according to that provision of the Code
      of Commerce most inimical to the claims of third parties, who in this way
      lose the benefit of delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien discovered that Camusot was proceeding against him with great
      energy. When Coralie heard the name, and for the first time learned the
      dreadful and humiliating step which her poet had taken for her sake, the
      angelic creature loved him ten times more than before, and would not
      approach Camusot. The bailiff bringing the warrant of arrest shrank back
      from the idea of dragging his prisoner out of bed, and went back to
      Camusot before applying to the President of the Tribunal of Commerce for
      an order to remove the debtor to a private hospital. Camusot hurried at
      once to the Rue de la Lune, and Coralie went down to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came up again she held the warrants, in which Lucien was
      described as a tradesman, in her hand. How had she obtained those papers
      from Camusot? What promise had she given? Coralie kept a sad, gloomy
      silence, but when she returned she looked as if all the life had gone out
      of her. She played in Camille Maupin&rsquo;s play, and contributed not a little
      to the success of that illustrious literary hermaphrodite; but the
      creation of this character was the last flicker of a bright, dying lamp.
      On the twentieth night, when Lucien had so far recovered that he had
      regained his appetite and could walk abroad, and talked of getting to work
      again, Coralie broke down; a secret trouble was weighing upon her.
      Berenice always believed that she had promised to go back to Camusot to
      save Lucien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mortification followed. Coralie was obliged to see her part given
      to Florine. Nathan had threatened the Gymnase with war if the management
      refused to give the vacant place to Coralie&rsquo;s rival. Coralie had persisted
      till she could play no longer, knowing that Florine was waiting to step
      into her place. She had overtasked her strength. The Gymnase had advanced
      sums during Lucien&rsquo;s illness, she had no money to draw; Lucien, eager to
      work though he was, was not yet strong enough to write, and he helped
      besides to nurse Coralie and to relieve Berenice. From poverty they had
      come to utter distress; but in Bianchon they found a skilful and devoted
      doctor, who obtained credit for them of the druggist. The landlord of the
      house and the tradespeople knew by this time how matters stood. The
      furniture was attached. The tailor and dressmaker no longer stood in awe
      of the journalist, and proceeded to extremes; and at last no one, with the
      exception of the pork-butcher and the druggist, gave the two unlucky
      children credit. For a week or more all three of them&mdash;Lucien,
      Berenice, and the invalid&mdash;were obliged to live on the various
      ingenious preparations sold by the pork-butcher; the inflammatory diet was
      little suited to the sick girl, and Coralie grew worse. Sheer want
      compelled Lucien to ask Lousteau for a return of the loan of a thousand
      francs lost at play by the friend who had deserted him in his hour of
      need. Perhaps, amid all his troubles, this step cost him most cruel
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau was not to be found in the Rue de la Harpe. Hunted down like a
      hare, he was lodging now with this friend, now with that. Lucien found him
      at last at Flicoteaux&rsquo;s; he was sitting at the very table at which Lucien
      had found him that evening when, for his misfortune, he forsook d&rsquo;Arthez
      for journalism. Lousteau offered him dinner, and Lucien accepted the
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came out of Flicoteaux&rsquo;s with Claude Vignon (who happened to be
      dining there that day) and the great man in obscurity, who kept his
      wardrobe at Samanon&rsquo;s, the four among them could not produce enough specie
      to pay for a cup of coffee at the Cafe Voltaire. They lounged about the
      Luxembourg in the hope of meeting with a publisher; and, as it fell out,
      they met with one of the most famous printers of the day. Lousteau
      borrowed forty francs of him, and divided the money into four equal parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Misery had brought down Lucien&rsquo;s pride and extinguished sentiment; he shed
      tears as he told the story of his troubles, but each one of his comrades
      had a tale as cruel as his own; and when the three versions had been
      given, it seemed to the poet that he was the least unfortunate among the
      four. All of them craved a respite from remembrance and thoughts which
      made trouble doubly hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau hurried to the Palais Royal to gamble with his remaining nine
      francs. The great man unknown to fame, though he had a divine mistress,
      must needs hie him to a low haunt of vice to wallow in perilous pleasure.
      Vignon betook himself to the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i> to drown memory and
      thought in a couple of bottles of Bordeaux; Lucien parted company with him
      on the threshold, declining to share that supper. When he shook hands with
      the one journalist who had not been hostile to him, it was with a cruel
      pang in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; he asked aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must do as one can,&rdquo; the great critic said. &ldquo;Your book is good, but
      it excited jealousy, and your struggle will be hard and long. Genius is a
      cruel disease. Every writer carries a canker in his heart, a devouring
      monster, like the tapeworm in the stomach, which destroys all feeling as
      it arises in him. Which is the stronger? The man or the disease? One has
      need be a great man, truly, to keep the balance between genius and
      character. The talent grows, the heart withers. Unless a man is a giant,
      unless he has the thews of a Hercules, he must be content either to lose
      his gift or to live without a heart. You are slender and fragile, you will
      give way,&rdquo; he added, as he turned into the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien returned home, thinking over that terrible verdict. He beheld the
      life of literature by the light of the profound truths uttered by Vignon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money! money!&rdquo; a voice cried in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew three bills of a thousand francs each, due respectively in
      one, two, and three months, imitating the handwriting of his
      brother-in-law, David Sechard, with admirable skill. He endorsed the
      bills, and took them next morning to Metivier, the paper-dealer in the Rue
      Serpente, who made no difficulty about taking them. Lucien wrote a few
      lines to give his brother-in-law notice of this assault upon his cash-box,
      promising, as usual in such cases, to be ready to meet the bills as they
      fell due.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all debts, his own and Coralie&rsquo;s, were paid, he put the three hundred
      francs which remained into Berenice&rsquo;s hands, bidding her to refuse him
      money if he asked her for it. He was afraid of a return of the gambler&rsquo;s
      frenzy. Lucien worked away gloomily in a sort of cold, speechless fury,
      putting forth all his powers into witty articles, written by the light of
      the lamp at Coralie&rsquo;s bedside. Whenever he looked up in search of ideas,
      his eyes fell on that beloved face, white as porcelain, fair with the
      beauty that belongs to the dying, and he saw a smile on her pale lips, and
      her eyes, grown bright with a more consuming pain than physical suffering,
      always turned on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien sent in his work, but he could not leave the house to worry
      editors, and his articles did not appear. When he at last made up his mind
      to go to the office, he met with a cool reception from Theodore Gaillard,
      who had advanced him money, and turned his literary diamonds to good
      account afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my dear fellow, you are falling off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must not
      let yourself down, your work wants inspiration!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little Lucien has written himself out with his romance and his first
      articles,&rdquo; cried Felicien Vernou, Merlin, and the whole chorus of his
      enemies, whenever his name came up at Dauriat&rsquo;s or the Vaudeville. &ldquo;The
      work he is sending us is pitiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have written oneself out&rdquo; (in the slang of journalism), is a verdict
      very hard to live down. It passed everywhere from mouth to mouth, ruining
      Lucien, all unsuspicious as he was. And, indeed, his burdens were too
      heavy for his strength. In the midst of a heavy strain of work, he was
      sued for the bills which he had drawn in David Sechard&rsquo;s name. He had
      recourse to Camusot&rsquo;s experience, and Coralie&rsquo;s sometime adorer was
      generous enough to assist the man she loved. The intolerable situation
      lasted for two whole months; the days being diversified by stamped papers
      handed over to Desroches, a friend of Bixiou, Blondet, and des Lupeaulx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in August, Bianchon told them that Coralie&rsquo;s condition was hopeless&mdash;she
      had only a few days to live. Those days were spent in tears by Berenice
      and Lucien; they could not hide their grief from the dying girl, and she
      was broken-hearted for Lucien&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some strange change was working in Coralie. She would have Lucien bring a
      priest; she must be reconciled to the Church and die in peace. Coralie
      died as a Christian; her repentance was sincere. Her agony and death took
      all energy and heart out of Lucien. He sank into a low chair at the foot
      of the bed, and never took his eyes off her till Death brought the end of
      her suffering. It was five o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Some singing-bird
      lighting upon a flower-pot on the window-sill, twittered a few notes.
      Berenice, kneeling by the bedside, was covering a hand fast growing cold
      with kisses and tears. On the chimney-piece there lay eleven sous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien went out. Despair made him beg for money to lay Coralie in her
      grave. He had wild thoughts of flinging himself at the Marquise d&rsquo;Espard&rsquo;s
      feet, of entreating the Comte du Chatelet, Mme. de Bargeton, Mlle. des
      Touches, nay, that terrible dandy of a de Marsay. All his pride had gone
      with his strength. He would have enlisted as a common soldier at that
      moment for money. He walked on with a slouching, feverish gait known to
      all the unhappy, reached Camille Maupin&rsquo;s house, entered, careless of his
      disordered dress, and sent in a message. He entreated Mlle. des Touches to
      see him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle only went to bed at three o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; said the
      servant, &ldquo;and no one would dare to disturb her until she rings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does she ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lucien wrote one of those harrowing appeals in which the well-dressed
      beggar flings all pride and self-respect to the winds. One evening, not so
      very long ago, when Lousteau had told him of the abject begging letters
      which Finot received, Lucien had thought it impossible that any creature
      would sink so low; and now, carried away by his pen, he had gone further,
      it may be, than other unlucky wretches upon the same road. He did not
      suspect, in his fever and imbecility, that he had just written a
      masterpiece of pathos. On his way home along the Boulevards, he met
      Barbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbet!&rdquo; he begged, holding out his hand. &ldquo;Five hundred francs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Two hundred,&rdquo; returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you have a heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I am a man of business as well. I have lost a lot of money
      through you,&rdquo; he concluded, after giving the history of the failure of
      Fendant and Cavalier, &ldquo;will you put me in the way of making some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a poet. You ought to understand all kinds of poetry,&rdquo; continued
      the little publisher. &ldquo;I want a few rollicking songs at this moment to put
      along with some more by different authors, or they will be down upon me
      over the copyright. I want to have a good collection to sell on the
      streets at ten sous. If you care to let me have ten good drinking-songs by
      to-morrow morning, or something spicy,&mdash;you know the sort of thing,
      eh!&mdash;I will pay you two hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lucien returned home, he found Coralie stretched out straight and
      stiff on a pallet-bed; Berenice, with many tears, had wrapped her in a
      coarse linen sheet, and put lighted candles at the four corners of the
      bed. Coralie&rsquo;s face had taken that strange, delicate beauty of death which
      so vividly impresses the living with the idea of absolute calm; she looked
      like some white girl in a decline; it seemed as if those pale, crimson
      lips must open and murmur the name which had blended with the name of God
      in the last words that she uttered before she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien told Berenice to order a funeral which should not cost more than
      two hundred francs, including the service at the shabby little church of
      the Bonne-Nouvelle. As soon as she had gone out, he sat down to a table,
      and beside the dead body of his love he composed ten rollicking songs to
      fit popular airs. The effort cost him untold anguish, but at last the
      brain began to work at the bidding of Necessity, as if suffering were not;
      and already Lucien had learned to put Claude Vignon&rsquo;s terrible maxims in
      practice, and to raise a barrier between heart and brain. What a night the
      poor boy spent over those drinking songs, writing by the light of the tall
      wax candles while the priest recited the prayers for the dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning broke before the last song was finished. Lucien tried it over to a
      street-song of the day, to the consternation of Berenice and the priest,
      who thought that he was mad:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Lads, &lsquo;tis tedious waste of time
      To mingle song and reason;
    Folly calls for laughing rhyme,
      Sense is out of season.
  Let Apollo be forgot
    When Bacchus fills the drinking-cup;
  Any catch is good, I wot,
    If good fellows take it up.
      Let philosophers protest,
        Let us laugh,
          And quaff,
      And a fig for the rest!

    As Hippocrates has said,
      Every jolly fellow,
    When a century has sped,
      Still is fit and mellow.
  No more following of a lass
    With the palsy in your legs?
  &mdash;While your hand can hold a glass,
    You can drain it to the dregs,
      With an undiminished zest.
        Let us laugh,
          And quaff,
      And a fig for the rest!

    Whence we come we know full well.
      Whiter are we going?
    Ne&rsquo;er a one of us can tell,
      &lsquo;Tis a thing past knowing.
  Faith! what does it signify,
    Take the good that Heaven sends;
  It is certain that we die,
    Certain that we live, my friends.
      Life is nothing but a jest.
        Let us laugh,
          And quaff,
      And a fig for the rest!
</pre>
    <p>
      He was shouting the reckless refrain when d&rsquo;Arthez and Bianchon arrived,
      to find him in a paroxysm of despair and exhaustion, utterly unable to
      make a fair copy of his verses. A torrent of tears followed; and when,
      amid his sobs, he had told his story, he saw the tears standing in his
      friends&rsquo; eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This wipes out many sins,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Arthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy are they who suffer for their sins in this world,&rdquo; the priest said
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the fair, dead face smiling at Eternity, while Coralie&rsquo;s
      lover wrote tavern-catches to buy a grave for her, and Barbet paid for the
      coffin&mdash;of the four candles lighted about the dead body of her who
      had thrilled a great audience as she stood behind the footlights in her
      Spanish basquina and scarlet green-clocked stockings; while beyond in the
      doorway, stood the priest who had reconciled the dying actress with God,
      now about to return to the church to say a mass for the soul of her who
      had &ldquo;loved much,&rdquo;&mdash;all the grandeur and the sordid aspects of the
      scene, all that sorrow crushed under by Necessity, froze the blood of the
      great writer and the great doctor. They sat down; neither of them could
      utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment a servant in livery announced Mlle. des Touches. That
      beautiful and noble woman understood everything at once. She stepped
      quickly across the room to Lucien, and slipped two thousand-franc notes
      into his hand as she grasped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he said, looking up at her with dull, hopeless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three stayed with Lucien, trying to soothe his despair with comforting
      words; but every spring seemed to be broken. At noon all the brotherhood,
      with the exception of Michel Chrestien (who, however, had learned the
      truth as to Lucien&rsquo;s treachery), was assembled in the poor little church
      of the Bonne-Nouvelle; Mlle. de Touches was present, and Berenice and
      Coralie&rsquo;s dresser from the theatre, with a couple of supernumeraries and
      the disconsolate Camusot. All the men accompanied the actress to her last
      resting-place in Pere Lachaise. Camusot, shedding hot tears, had solemnly
      promised Lucien to buy the grave in perpetuity, and to put a headstone
      above it with the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                               CORALIE

                         AGED NINETEEN YEARS

                             August, 1822
</pre>
    <p>
      Lucien stayed there, on the sloping ground that looks out over Paris,
      until the sun had set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will love me now?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;My truest friends despise me.
      Whatever I might have done, she who lies here would have thought me wholly
      noble and good. I have no one left to me now but my sister and mother and
      David. And what do they think of me at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor distinguished provincial! He went back to the Rue de la Lune; but the
      sight of the rooms was so acutely painful, that he could not stay in them,
      and he took a cheap lodging elsewhere in the same street. Mlle. des
      Touches&rsquo; two thousand francs and the sale of the furniture paid the debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice had two hundred francs left, on which they lived for two months.
      Lucien was prostrate; he could neither write nor think; he gave way to
      morbid grief. Berenice took pity upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose that you were to go back to your own country, how are you to get
      there?&rdquo; she asked one day, by way of reply to an exclamation of Lucien&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even so, you must live and sleep on the way. Even if you walk twelve
      leagues a day, you will want twenty francs at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get them together,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his clothes and his best linen, keeping nothing but strict
      necessaries, and went to Samanon, who offered fifty francs for his entire
      wardrobe. In vain he begged the money-lender to let him have enough to pay
      his fare by the coach; Samanon was inexorable. In a paroxysm of fury,
      Lucien rushed to Frascati&rsquo;s, staked the proceeds of the sale, and lost
      every farthing. Back once more in the wretched room in the Rue de la Lune,
      he asked Berenice for Coralie&rsquo;s shawl. The good girl looked at him, and
      knew in a moment what he meant to do. He had confessed to his loss at the
      gaming-table; and now he was going to hang himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, sir? Go out for a walk, and come back again at midnight. I
      will get the money for you; but keep to the Boulevards, do not go towards
      the Quais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucien paced up and down the Boulevards. He was stupid with grief. He
      watched the passers-by and the stream of traffic, and felt that he was
      alone, and a very small atom in this seething whirlpool of Paris, churned
      by the strife of innumerable interests. His thoughts went back to the
      banks of his Charente; a craving for happiness and home awoke in him; and
      with the craving, came one of the sudden febrile bursts of energy which
      half-feminine natures like his mistake for strength. He would not give up
      until he had poured out his heart to David Sechard, and taken counsel of
      the three good angels still left to him on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lounged along, he caught sight of Berenice&mdash;Berenice in her
      Sunday clothes, speaking to a stranger at the corner of the Rue de la Lune
      and the filthy Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, where she had taken her stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked Lucien, dismayed by a sudden suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your twenty francs,&rdquo; said the girl, slipping four five-franc
      pieces into the poet&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;They may cost dear yet; but you can go,&rdquo; and
      she had fled before Lucien could see the way she went; for, in justice to
      him, it must be said that the money burned his hand, he wanted to return
      it, but he was forced to keep it as the final brand set upon him by life
      in Paris.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
