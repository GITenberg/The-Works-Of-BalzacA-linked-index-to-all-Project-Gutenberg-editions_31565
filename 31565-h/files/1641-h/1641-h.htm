                             DEDICATION

                         To Constance-Victoire.

  Here, madame, is one of those books which come into the mind,
  whence no one knows, giving pleasure to the author before he can
  foresee what reception the public, our great present judge, will
  accord to it. Feeling almost certain of your sympathy in my
  pleasure, I dedicate the book to you. Ought it not to belong to
  you as the tithe formerly belonged to the Church in memory of God,
  who makes all things bud and fruit in the fields and in the
  intellect?

  A few lumps of clay, left by Moliere at the feet of his colossal
  statue of Tartuffe, have here been kneaded by a hand more daring
  than able; but, at whatever distance I may be from the greatest of
  comic writers, I shall still be glad to have used these crumbs in
  showing the modern Hypocrite in action. The chief encouragement
  that I have had in this difficult undertaking was in finding it
  apart from all religious questions,&mdash;questions which ought to be
  kept out of it for the sake of one so pious as yourself; and also
  because of what a great writer has lately called our present
  &ldquo;indifference in matters of religion.&rdquo;
 
  May the double signification of your names be for my book a
  prophecy! Deign to find here the respectful gratitude of him who
  ventures to call himself the most devoted of your servants.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. DEPARTING PARIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tourniquet Saint-Jean, the narrow passage entered through a turnstile,
      a description of which was said to be so wearisome in the study entitled
      &ldquo;A Double Life&rdquo; (Scenes from Private Life), that naive relic of old Paris,
      has at the present moment no existence except in our said typography. The
      building of the Hotel-de-Ville, such as we now see it, swept away a whole
      section of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1830, passers along the street could still see the turnstile painted on
      the sign of a wine-merchant, but even that house, its last asylum, has
      been demolished. Alas! old Paris is disappearing with frightful rapidity.
      Here and there, in the course of this history of Parisian life, will be
      found preserved, sometimes the type of the dwellings of the middle ages,
      like that described in &ldquo;Fame and Sorrow&rdquo; (Scenes from Private Life), one
      or two specimens of which exist to the present day; sometimes a house like
      that of Judge Popinot, rue du Fouarre, a specimen of the former
      bourgeoisie; here, the remains of Fulbert&rsquo;s house; there, the old dock of
      the Seine as it was under Charles IX. Why should not the historian of
      French society, a new Old Mortality, endeavor to save these curious
      expressions of the past, as Walter Scott&rsquo;s old man rubbed up the
      tombstones? Certainly, for the last ten years the outcries of literature
      in this direction have not been superfluous; art is beginning to disguise
      beneath its floriated ornaments those ignoble facades of what are called
      in Paris &ldquo;houses of product,&rdquo; which one of our poets has jocosely compared
      to chests of drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us remark here, that the creation of the municipal commission &ldquo;del
      ornamento&rdquo; which superintends at Milan the architecture of street facades,
      and to which every house owner is compelled to subject his plan, dates
      from the seventeenth century. Consequently, we see in that charming
      capital the effects of this public spirit on the part of nobles and
      burghers, while we admire their buildings so full of character and
      originality. Hideous, unrestrained speculation which, year after year,
      changes the uniform level of storeys, compresses a whole apartment into
      the space of what used to be a salon, and wages war upon gardens, will
      infallibly react on Parisian manners and morals. We shall soon be forced
      to live more without than within. Our sacred private life, the freedom and
      liberty of home, where will they be?&mdash;reserved for those who can
      muster fifty thousand francs a year! In fact, few millionaires now allow
      themselves the luxury of a house to themselves, guarded by a courtyard on
      a street and protected from public curiosity by a shady garden at the
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      By levelling fortunes, that section of the Code which regulates
      testamentary bequests, has produced these huge stone phalansteries, in
      which thirty families are often lodged, returning a rental of a hundred
      thousand francs a year. Fifty years hence we shall be able to count on our
      fingers the few remaining houses which resemble that occupied, at the
      moment our narrative begins, by the Thuillier family,&mdash;a really
      curious house which deserves the honor of an exact description, if only to
      compare the life of the bourgeoisie of former times with that of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation and the aspect of this house, the frame of our present Scene
      of manners and morals, has, moreover, a flavor, a perfume of the lesser
      bourgeoisie, which may attract or repel attention according to the taste
      of each reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the Thuillier house did not belong to either Monsieur
      or Madame Thuillier, but to Mademoiselle Thuillier, the sister of Monsieur
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This house, bought during the first six months which followed the
      revolution of July by Mademoiselle Marie-Jeanne-Brigitte Thuillier, a
      spinster of full age, stands about the middle of the rue Saint-Dominique
      d&rsquo;Enfer, to the right as you enter by the rue d&rsquo;Enfer, so that the main
      building occupied by Monsieur Thuillier faces south.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progressive movement which is carrying the Parisian population to the
      heights along the right bank of the Seine had long injured the sale of
      property in what is called the &ldquo;Latin quarter,&rdquo; when reasons, which will
      be given when we come to treat of the character and habits of Monsieur
      Thuillier, determined his sister to the purchase of real estate. She
      obtained this property for the small sum of forty-six thousand francs;
      certain extras amounted to six thousand more; in all, the price paid was
      fifty-two thousand francs. A description of the property given in the
      style of an advertisement, and the results obtained by Monsieur
      Thuillier&rsquo;s exertions, will explain by what means so many fortunes
      increased enormously after July, 1830, while so many others sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the street the house presents a facade of rough stone covered with
      plaster, cracked by weather and lined by the mason&rsquo;s instrument into a
      semblance of blocks of cut stone. This frontage is so common in Paris and
      so ugly that the city ought to offer premiums to house-owners who would
      build their facades of cut-stone blocks. Seven windows lighted the gray
      front of this house which was raised three storeys, ending in a mansard
      roof covered with slate. The porte-cochere, heavy and solid, showed by its
      workmanship and style that the front building on the street had been
      erected in the days of the Empire, to utilize a part of the courtyard of
      the vast old mansion, built at an epoch when the quarter d&rsquo;Enfer enjoyed a
      certain vogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side was the porter&rsquo;s lodge; on the other the staircase of the
      front building. Two wings, built against the adjoining houses, had
      formerly served as stables, coach-house, kitchen and offices to the rear
      dwelling; but since 1830, they had been converted into warerooms. The one
      on the right was let to a certain M. Metivier, jr., wholesale dealer in
      paper; that on the left to a bookseller named Barbet. The offices of each
      were above the warerooms; the bookseller occupying the first storey, and
      the paper-dealer the second storey of the house on the street. Metivier,
      jr., who was more of a commission merchant in paper than a regular dealer,
      and Barbet, much more of a money lender and discounter than a bookseller,
      kept these vast warerooms for the purpose of storing,&mdash;one, his
      stacks of paper, bought of needy manufacturers, the other, editions of
      books given as security for loans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark of bookselling and the pike of paper-dealing lived on the best
      of terms, and their mutual operations, exempt from the turmoil of retail
      business, brought so few carriages into that tranquil courtyard that the
      concierge was obliged to pull up the grass between the paving stones.
      Messrs. Barbet and Metivier paid a few rare visits to their landlords, and
      the punctuality with which they paid their rent classed them as good
      tenants; in fact, they were looked upon as very honest men by the
      Thuillier circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the third floor on the street, it was made into two apartments; one
      of which was occupied by M. Dutocq, clerk of the justice of peace, a
      retired government employee, and a frequenter of the Thuillier salon; the
      other by the hero of this Scene, about whom we must content ourselves at
      the present moment by fixing the amount of his rent,&mdash;namely, seven
      hundred francs a year,&mdash;and the location he had chosen in the heart
      of this well-filled building, exactly three years before the curtain rises
      on the present domestic drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, a bachelor of fifty, occupied the larger of the two apartments
      on the third floor. He kept a cook, and the rent of the rooms was a
      thousand francs a year. Within two years of the time of her purchase,
      Mademoiselle Thuillier was receiving seven thousand two hundred francs in
      rentals, for a house which the late proprietor had supplied with outside
      blinds, renovated within, and adorned with mirrors, without being able to
      sell or let it. Moreover, the Thuilliers themselves, nobly lodged, as we
      shall see, enjoyed also a fine garden,&mdash;one of the finest in that
      quarter,&mdash;the trees of which shaded the lonely little street named
      the rue Neuve-Saint-Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing between the courtyard and the garden, the main building, which
      they inhabited, seems to have been the caprice of some enriched bourgeois
      in the reign of Louis XIV.; the dwelling, perhaps, of a president of the
      parliament, or that of a tranquil savant. Its noble free-stone blocks,
      damaged by time, have a certain air of Louis-the-Fourteenth grandeur; the
      courses of the facade define the storeys; panels of red brick recall the
      appearance of the stables at Versailles; the windows have masks carved as
      ornaments in the centre of their arches and below their sills. The door,
      of small panels in the upper half and plain below, through which, when
      open, the garden can be seen, is of that honest, unassuming style which
      was often employed in former days for the porter&rsquo;s lodges of the royal
      chateaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      This building, with five windows to each course, rises two storeys above
      the ground-floor, and is particularly noticeable for a roof of four sides
      ending in a weather-vane, and broken here and there by tall, handsome
      chimneys, and oval windows. Perhaps this structure is the remains of some
      great mansion; but after examining all the existing old maps of Paris, we
      find nothing which bears out this conjecture. Moreover, the title-deeds of
      property under Louis XIV. was Petitot, the celebrated painter in
      miniature, who obtained it originally from President Lecamus. We may
      therefore believe that Lecamus lived in this building while he was
      erecting his more famous mansion in the rue de Thorigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Art and the legal robe have passed this way in turn. How many
      instigations of needs and pleasures have led to the interior arrangement
      of the dwelling! To right, as we enter a square hall forming a closed
      vestibule, rises a stone staircase with two windows looking on the garden.
      Beneath the staircase opens a door to the cellar. From this vestibule we
      enter the dining-room, lighted from the courtyard, and the dining-room
      communicates at its side with the kitchen, which forms a continuation of
      the wing in which are the warerooms of Metivier and Barbet. Behind the
      staircase extends, on the garden side, a fine study or office with two
      large windows. The first and second floor form two complete apartments,
      and the servants&rsquo; quarters are shown by the oval windows in the four-sided
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large porcelain stove heats the square vestibule, the two glass doors of
      which, placed opposite to each other, light it. This room, paved in black
      and white marble, is especially noticeable for a ceiling of beams formerly
      painted and gilt, but which had since received, probably under the Empire,
      a coat of plain white paint. The three doors of the study, salon and
      dining-room, surmounted by oval panels, are awaiting a restoration that is
      more than needed. The wood-work is heavy, but the ornamentation is not
      without merit. The salon, panelled throughout, recalls the great century
      by its tall mantelpiece of Languedoc marble, its ceiling decorated at the
      corners, and by the style of its windows, which still retain their little
      panes. The dining-room, communicating with the salon by a double door, is
      floored with stone; the wood-work is oak, unpainted, and an atrocious
      modern wall-paper has been substituted for the tapestries of the olden
      time. The ceiling is of chestnut; and the study, modernized by Thuillier,
      adds its quota to these discordances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white and gold mouldings of the salon are so effaced that nothing
      remains of the gilding but reddish lines, while the white enamelling is
      yellow, cracked, and peeling off. Never did the Latin saying &ldquo;Otium cum
      dignitate&rdquo; have a greater commentary to the mind of a poet than in this
      noble building. The iron-work of the staircase baluster is worthy of the
      artist and the magistrate; but to find other traces of their taste to-day
      in this majestic relic, the eyes of an artistic observer are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thuilliers and their predecessors have frequently degraded this jewel
      of the upper bourgeoisie by the habits and inventions of the lesser
      bourgeoisie. Look at those walnut chairs covered with horse-hair, that
      mahogany table with its oilcloth cover, that sideboard, also of mahogany,
      that carpet, bought at a bargain, beneath the table, those metal lamps,
      that wretched paper with its red border, those execrable engravings, and
      the calico curtains with red fringes, in a dining-room, where the friends
      of Petitot once feasted! Do you notice the effect produced in the salon by
      those portraits of Monsieur and Madame and Mademoiselle Thuillier by
      Pierre Grassou, the artist par excellence of the modern bourgeoisie. Have
      you remarked the card-tables and the consoles of the Empire, the tea-table
      supported by a lyre, and that species of sofa, of gnarled mahogany,
      covered in painted velvet of a chocolate tone? On the chimney-piece, with
      the clock (representing the Bellona of the Empire), are candelabra with
      fluted columns. Curtains of woollen damask, with under-curtains of
      embroidered muslin held back by stamped brass holders, drape the windows.
      On the floor a cheap carpet. The handsome vestibule has wooden benches,
      covered with velvet, and the panelled walls with their fine carvings are
      mostly hidden by wardrobes, brought there from time to time from the
      bedrooms occupied by the Thuilliers. Fear, that hideous divinity, has
      caused the family to add sheet-iron doors on the garden side and on the
      courtyard side, which are folded back against the walls in the daytime,
      and are closed at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to explain the deplorable profanation practised on this
      monument of the private life of the bourgeoisie of the seventeenth
      century, by the private life of the bourgeoisie of the nineteenth. At the
      beginning of the Consulate, let us say, some master-mason having bought
      the ancient building, took the idea of turning to account the ground which
      lay between it and the street. He probably pulled down the fine
      porte-cochere or entrance gate, flanked by little lodges which guarded the
      charming &ldquo;sejour&rdquo; (to use a word of the olden time), and proceeded, with
      the industry of a Parisian proprietor, to impress his withering mark on
      the elegance of the old building. What a curious study might be made of
      the successive title-deeds of property in Paris! A private lunatic asylum
      performs its functions in the rue des Batailles in the former dwelling of
      the Chevalier Pierre Bayard du Terrail, once without fear and without
      reproach; a street has now been built by the present bourgeois
      administration through the site of the hotel Necker. Old Paris is
      departing, following its kings who abandoned it. For one masterpiece of
      architecture saved from destruction by a Polish princess (the hotel
      Lambert, Ile Saint-Louis, bought and occupied by the Princess Czartoriska)
      how many little palaces have fallen, like this dwelling of Petitot, into
      the hands of such as Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here follows the causes which made Mademoiselle Thuillier the owner of the
      house.

      CHAPTER II. THE HISTORY OF A TYRANNY
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the fall of the Villele ministry, Monsieur Louis-Jerome Thuillier, who
      had then seen twenty-six years&rsquo; service as a clerk in the ministry of
      finance, became sub-director of a department thereof; but scarcely had he
      enjoyed the subaltern authority of a position formerly his lowest hope,
      when the events of July, 1830, forced him to resign it. He calculated,
      shrewdly enough, that his pension would be honorably and readily given by
      the new-comers, glad to have another office at their disposal. He was
      right; for a pension of seventeen hundred francs was paid to him
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prudent sub-director first talked of resigning, his sister, who
      was far more the companion of his life than his wife, trembled for his
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of Thuillier?&rdquo; was a question which Madame and
      Mademoiselle Thuillier put to each other with mutual terror in their
      little lodging on a third floor of the rue d&rsquo;Argenteuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Securing his pension will occupy him for a time,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Thuillier
      said one day; &ldquo;but I am thinking of investing my savings in a way that
      will cut out work for him. Yes; it will be something like administrating
      the finances to manage a piece of property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! you will save his life,&rdquo; cried Madame Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always looked for a crisis of this kind in Jerome&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; replied
      the old maid, with a protecting air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Thuillier had too often heard her brother remark: &ldquo;Such a one
      is dead; he only survived his retirement two years&rdquo;; she had too often
      heard Colleville, her brother&rsquo;s intimate friend, a government employee
      like himself, say, jesting on this climacteric of bureaucrats, &ldquo;We shall
      all come to it, ourselves,&rdquo; not to appreciate the danger her brother was
      running. The change from activity to leisure is, in truth, the critical
      period for government employees of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of them who know not how to substitute, or perhaps cannot substitute
      other occupations for the work to which they have been accustomed, change
      in a singular manner; some die outright; others take to fishing, the
      vacancy of that amusement resembling that of their late employment under
      government; others, who are smarter men, dabble in stocks, lose their
      savings, and are thankful to obtain a place in some enterprise that is
      likely to succeed, after a first disaster and liquidation, in the hands of
      an abler management. The late clerk then rubs his hands, now empty, and
      says to himself, &ldquo;I always did foresee the success of the business.&rdquo; But
      nearly all these retired bureaucrats have to fight against their former
      habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Colleville used to say, &ldquo;are victims to a sort of &lsquo;spleen&rsquo; 
      peculiar to the government clerk; they die of a checked circulation; a
      red-tapeworm is in their vitals. That little Poiret couldn&rsquo;t see the
      well-known white carton without changing color at the beloved sight; he
      used to turn from green to yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Thuillier was considered the moving spirit of her brother&rsquo;s
      household; she was not without decision and force of character, as the
      following history will show. This superiority over those who immediately
      surrounded her enabled her to judge her brother, although she adored him.
      After witnessing the failure of the hopes she had set upon her idol, she
      had too much real maternity in her feeling for him to let herself be
      mistaken as to his social value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier and his sister were children of the head porter at the ministry
      of finance. Jerome had escaped, thanks to his near-sightedness, all drafts
      and conscriptions. The father&rsquo;s ambition was to make his son a government
      clerk. At the beginning of this century the army presented too many posts
      not to leave various vacancies in the government offices. A deficiency of
      minor officials enabled old Pere Thuillier to hoist his son upon the
      lowest step of the bureaucratic hierarchy. The old man died in 1814,
      leaving Jerome on the point of becoming sub-director, but with no other
      fortune than that prospect. The worthy Thuillier and his wife (who died in
      1810) had retired from active service in 1806, with a pension as their
      only means of support; having spent what property they had in giving
      Jerome the education required in these days, and in supporting both him
      and his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the Restoration on the bureaucracy is well known. From
      the forty and one suppressed departments a crowd of honorable employees
      returned to Paris with nothing to do, and clamorous for places inferior to
      those they had lately occupied. To these acquired rights were added those
      of exiled families ruined by the Revolution. Pressed between the two
      floods, Jerome thought himself lucky not to have been dismissed under some
      frivolous pretext. He trembled until the day when, becoming by mere chance
      sub-director, he saw himself secure of a retiring pension. This cursory
      view of matters will serve to explain Monsieur Thuillier&rsquo;s very limited
      scope and knowledge. He had learned the Latin, mathematics, history, and
      geography that are taught in schools, but he never got beyond what is
      called the second class; his father having preferred to take advantage of
      a sudden opportunity to place him at the ministry. So, while the young
      Thuillier was making his first records on the Grand-Livre, he ought to
      have been studying his rhetoric and philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While grinding the ministerial machine, he had no leisure to cultivate
      letters, still less the arts; but he acquired a routine knowledge of his
      business, and when he had an opportunity to rise, under the Empire, to the
      sphere of superior employees, he assumed a superficial air of competence
      which concealed the son of a porter, though none of it rubbed into his
      mind. His ignorance, however, taught him to keep silence, and silence
      served him well. He accustomed himself to practise, under the imperial
      regime, a passive obedience which pleased his superiors; and it was to
      this quality that he owed at a later period his promotion to the rank of
      sub-director. His routine habits then became great experience; his manners
      and his silence concealed his lack of education, and his absolute nullity
      was a recommendation, for a cipher was needed. The government was afraid
      of displeasing both parties in the Chamber by selecting a man from either
      side; it therefore got out of the difficulty by resorting to the rule of
      seniority. That is how Thuillier became sub-director. Mademoiselle
      Thuillier, knowing that her brother abhorred reading, and could substitute
      no business for the bustle of a public office, had wisely resolved to
      plunge him into the cares of property, into the culture of a garden, in
      short, into all the infinitely petty concerns and neighborhood intrigues
      which make up the life of the bourgeoisie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transplanting of the Thuillier household from the rue d&rsquo;Argenteuil to
      the rue Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer, the business of making the purchase, of
      finding a suitable porter, and then of obtaining tenants occupied
      Thuillier from 1831 to 1832. When the phenomenon of the change was
      accomplished, and the sister saw that Jerome had borne it fairly well, she
      found him other cares and occupations (about which we shall hear later),
      all based upon the character of the man himself, as to which it will now
      be useful to give information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the son of a ministerial porter, Thuillier was what is called a
      fine man, slender in figure, above middle height, and possessing a face
      that was rather agreeable if wearing his spectacles, but frightful without
      them; which is frequently the case with near-sighted persons; for the
      habit of looking through glasses has covered the pupils of his eyes with a
      sort of film.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the ages of eighteen and thirty, young Thuillier had much success
      among women, in a sphere which began with the lesser bourgeois and ended
      in that of the heads of departments. Under the Empire, war left Parisian
      society rather denuded of men of energy, who were mostly on the
      battlefield; and perhaps, as a great physician has suggested, this may
      account for the flabbiness of the generation which occupies the middle of
      the nineteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier, forced to make himself noticeable by other charms than those of
      mind, learned to dance and to waltz in a way to be cited; he was called
      &ldquo;that handsome Thuillier&rdquo;; he played billiards to perfection; he knew how
      to cut out likenesses in black paper, and his friend Colleville coached
      him so well that he was able to sing all the ballads of the day. These
      various small accomplishments resulted in that appearance of success which
      deceives youth and befogs it about the future. Mademoiselle Thuillier,
      from 1806 to 1814, believed in her brother as Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Orleans
      believed in Louis-Philippe. She was proud of Jerome; she expected to see
      him the director-general of his department of the ministry, thanks to his
      successes in certain salons, where, undoubtedly, he would never have been
      admitted but for the circumstances which made society under the Empire a
      medley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the successes of &ldquo;that handsome Thuillier&rdquo; were usually of short
      duration; women did not care to keep his devotion any more than he desired
      to make his devotion eternal. He was really an unwilling Don Juan; the
      career of a &ldquo;beau&rdquo; wearied him to the point of aging him; his face,
      covered with lines like that of an old coquette, looked a dozen years
      older than the registers made him. There remained to him of all his
      successes in gallantry, a habit of looking at himself in mirrors, of
      buttoning his coat to define his waist, and of posing in various dancing
      attitudes; all of which prolonged, beyond the period of enjoying his
      advantages, the sort of lease that he held on his cognomen, &ldquo;that handsome
      Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth of 1806 has, however, become a fable, in 1826. He retains a few
      vestiges of the former costume of the beaux of the Empire, which are not
      unbecoming to the dignity of a former sub-director. He still wears the
      white cravat with innumerable folds, wherein his chin is buried, and the
      coquettish bow, formerly tied by the hands of beauty, the two ends of
      which threaten danger to the passers to right and left. He follows the
      fashions of former days, adapting them to his present needs; he tips his
      hat on the back of his head, and wears shoes and thread stockings in
      summer; his long-tailed coats remind one of the well-known &ldquo;surtouts&rdquo; of
      the Empire; he has not yet abandoned his frilled shirts and his white
      waistcoats; he still plays with his Empire switch, and holds himself so
      erect that his back bends in. No one, seeing Thuillier promenading on the
      boulevards, would take him for the son of a man who cooked the breakfasts
      of the clerks at a ministry and wore the livery of Louis XVI.; he
      resembles an imperial diplomatist or a sub-prefect. Now, not only did
      Mademoiselle Thuillier very innocently work upon her brother&rsquo;s weak spot
      by encouraging in him an excessive care of his person, which, in her, was
      simply a continuation of her worship, but she also provided him with
      family joys, by transplanting to their midst a household which had
      hitherto been quasi-collateral to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that of Monsieur Colleville, an intimate friend of Thuillier. But
      before we proceed to describe Pylades let us finish with Orestes, and
      explain why Thuillier&mdash;that handsome Thuillier&mdash;was left without
      a family of his own&mdash;for the family, be it said, is non-existent
      without children. Herein appears one of those deep mysteries which lie
      buried in the arena of private life, a few shreds of which rise to the
      surface at moments when the pain of a concealed situation grows poignant.
      This concerns the life of Madame and Mademoiselle Thuillier; so far, we
      have seen only the life (and we may call it the public life) of Jerome
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie-Jeanne-Brigitte Thuillier, four years older than her brother, had
      been utterly sacrificed to him; it was easier to give a career to one than
      a &ldquo;dot&rdquo; to the other. Misfortune to some natures is a pharos, which
      illumines to their eyes the dark low corners of social existence. Superior
      to her brother both in mind and energy, Brigitte had one of those natures
      which, under the hammer of persecution, gather themselves together, become
      compact and powerfully resistant, not to say inflexible. Jealous of her
      independence, she kept aloof from the life of the household; choosing to
      make herself the sole arbiter of her own fate. At fourteen years of age,
      she went to live alone in a garret, not far from the ministry of finance,
      which was then in the rue Vivienne, and also not far from the Bank of
      France, then, and now, in the rue de la Vrilliere. There she bravely gave
      herself up to a form of industry little known and the perquisite of a few
      persons, which she obtained, thanks to the patrons of her father. It
      consisted in making bags to hold coin for the Bank, the Treasury, and the
      great financial houses. At the end of three years she employed two
      workwomen. By investing her savings on the Grand-Livre, she found herself,
      in 1814, the mistress of three thousand six hundred francs a year, earned
      in fifteen years. As she spent little, and dined with her father as long
      as he lived, and, as government securities were very low during the last
      convulsions of the Empire, this result, which seems at first sight
      exaggerated, explains itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the death of their father, Brigitte and Jerome, the former being
      twenty-seven, the latter twenty-three, united their existence. Brother and
      sister were bound together by an extreme affection. If Jerome, then at the
      height of his success, was pinched for money, his sister, clothed in
      serge, and her fingers roughened by the coarse thread with which she sewed
      her bags, would give him a few louis. In Brigitte&rsquo;s eyes Jerome was the
      handsomest and most charming man in the whole French Empire. To keep house
      for this cherished brother, to be initiated into the secrets of Lindor and
      Don Juan, to be his handmaiden, his spaniel, was Brigitte&rsquo;s dream. She
      immolated herself lovingly to an idol whose selfishness, always great, was
      enormously increased by her self-sacrifice. She sold her business to her
      fore-woman for fifteen thousand francs and came to live with Thuillier in
      the rue d&rsquo;Argenteuil, where she made herself the mother, protectress, and
      servant of this spoiled child of women. Brigitte, with the natural caution
      of a girl who owed everything to her own discretion and her own labor,
      concealed the amount of her savings from Jerome,&mdash;fearing, no doubt,
      the extravagance of a man of gallantry. She merely paid a quota of six
      hundred francs a year to the expenses of the household, and this, with her
      brother&rsquo;s eighteen hundred, enabled her to make both ends meet at the end
      of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first days of their coming together, Thuillier listened to his
      sister as to an oracle; he consulted her in his trifling affairs, kept
      none of his secrets from her, and thus made her taste the fruit of
      despotism which was, in truth, the one little sin of her nature. But the
      sister had sacrificed everything to the brother; she had staked her all
      upon his heart; she lived by him only. Brigitte&rsquo;s ascendancy over Jerome
      was singularly proved by the marriage which she procured for him about the
      year 1814.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the tendency to enforced reduction which the new-comers to power
      under the Restoration were beginning to bring about in the government
      offices, and particularly since the return of the old society which sought
      to ride over the bourgeoisie, Brigitte understood, far better than her
      brother could explain it to her, the social crisis which presently
      extinguished their common hopes. No more successes for that handsome
      Thuillier in the salons of the nobles who now succeeded the plebeians of
      the Empire!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was not enough of a person to take up a politic opinion and
      choose a party; he felt, as his sister did for him, the necessity of
      profiting by the remains of his youth to make a settlement. In such a
      situation, a sister as jealous of her power as Brigitte naturally would,
      and ought, to marry her brother, to suit herself as well as to suit him;
      for she alone could make him really happy, Madame Thuillier being only an
      indispensable accessory to the obtaining of two or three children. If
      Brigitte did not have an intellect quite the equal of her will, at least
      she had the instinct of her despotism; without, it is true, education, she
      marched straight before her, with the headstrong determination of a nature
      accustomed to succeed. She had the genius of housekeeping, a faculty for
      economy, a thorough understanding of how to live, and a love for work. She
      saw plainly that she could never succeed in marrying Jerome into a sphere
      above their own, where parents might inquire into their domestic life and
      feel uneasy at finding a mistress already reigning in the home. She
      therefore sought in a lower grade for persons to dazzle, and found, almost
      beside her, a suitable match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oldest usher at the Bank, a man named Lemprun, had an only daughter,
      called Celeste. Mademoiselle Celeste Lemprun would inherit the fortune of
      her mother, the only daughter of a rich farmer. This fortune consisted of
      some acres of land in the environs of Paris, which the old father still
      worked; besides this, she would have the property of Lemprun himself, a
      man who had left the firms of Thelusson and of Keller to enter the service
      of the Bank of France. Lemprun, now the head of that service, enjoyed the
      respect and consideration of the governors and auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank council, on hearing of the probable marriage of Celeste to an
      honorable employee at the ministry of finance, promised a wedding present
      of six thousand francs. This gift, added to twelve thousand given by Pere
      Lemprun, and twelve thousand more from the maternal grandfather, Sieur
      Galard, market-gardener at Auteuil, brought up the dowry to thirty
      thousand francs. Old Galard and Monsieur and Madame Lemprun were delighted
      with the marriage. Lemprun himself knew Mademoiselle Thuillier, and
      considered her one of the worthiest and most conscientious women in Paris.
      Brigitte then, for the first time, allowed her investments on the
      Grand-Livre to shine forth, assuring Lemprun that she should never marry;
      consequently, neither he nor his wife, persons devoted to the main chance,
      would ever allow themselves to find fault with Brigitte. Above all, they
      were greatly struck by the splendid prospects of the handsome Thuillier,
      and the marriage took place, as the conventional saying is, to the general
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor of the Bank and the secretary were the bride&rsquo;s witnesses;
      Monsieur de la Billardiere, director of Thuillier&rsquo;s department, and
      Monsieur Rabourdin, head of the office, being those of the groom. Six days
      after the marriage old Lemprun was the victim of a daring robbery which
      made a great noise in the newspapers of the day, though it was quickly
      forgotten during the events of 1815. The guilty parties having escaped
      detection, Lemprun wished to make up the loss; but the Bank agreed to
      carry the deficit to its profit and loss account; nevertheless, the poor
      old man actually died of the grief this affair had caused him. He regarded
      it as an attack upon his aged honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lemprun then resigned all her property to her daughter, Madame
      Thuillier, and went to live with her father at Auteuil until he died from
      an accident in 1817. Alarmed at the prospect of having to manage or lease
      the market-garden and the farm of her father, Madame Lemprun entreated
      Brigitte, whose honesty and capacity astonished her, to wind up old
      Galard&rsquo;s affairs, and to settle the property in such a way that her
      daughter should take possession of everything, securing to her mother
      fifteen hundred francs a year and the house at Auteuil. The landed
      property of the old farmer was sold in lots, and brought in thirty
      thousand francs. Lemprun&rsquo;s estate had given as much more, so that Madame
      Thuillier&rsquo;s fortune, including her &ldquo;dot,&rdquo; amounted in 1818 to ninety
      thousand francs. Joining the revenue of this property to that of the
      brother and sister, the Thuillier household had an income, in 1818,
      amounting to eleven thousand francs, managed by Brigitte alone on her sole
      responsibility. It is necessary to begin by stating this financial
      position, not only to prevent objections but to rid the drama of
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte began, from the first, by allowing her brother five hundred
      francs a month, and by sailing the household boat at the rate of five
      thousand francs a year. She granted to her sister-in-law fifty francs a
      month, explaining to her carefully that she herself was satisfied with
      forty. To strengthen her despotism by the power of money, Brigitte laid by
      the surplus of her own funds. She made, so it was said in business
      offices, usurious loans by means of her brother, who appeared as a
      money-lender. If, between the years 1813 and 1830, Brigitte had
      capitalized sixty thousand francs, that sum can be explained by the rise
      in the Funds, and there is no need to have recourse to accusations more or
      less well founded, which have nothing to do with our present history.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first days of the marriage, Brigitte subdued the unfortunate
      Madame Thuillier with a touch of the spur and a jerk of the bit, both of
      which she made her feel severely. A further display of tyranny was
      useless; the victim resigned herself at once. Celeste, thoroughly
      understood by Brigitte, a girl without mind or education, accustomed to a
      sedentary life and a tranquil atmosphere, was extremely gentle by nature;
      she was pious in the fullest acceptation of the word; she would willingly
      have expiated by the hardest punishments the involuntary wrong of giving
      pain to her neighbor. She was utterly ignorant of life; accustomed to be
      waited on by her mother, who did the whole service of the house, for
      Celeste was unable to make much exertion, owing to a lymphatic
      constitution which the least toil wearied. She was truly a daughter of the
      people of Paris, where children, seldom handsome, and of no vigor, the
      product of poverty and toil, of homes without fresh air, without freedom
      of action, without any of the conveniences of life, meet us at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the marriage, Celeste was seen to be a little woman, fair
      and faded almost to sickliness, fat, slow, and silly in the countenance.
      Her forehead, much too large and too prominent, suggested water on the
      brain, and beneath that waxen cupola her face, noticeably too small and
      ending in a point like the nose of a mouse, made some people fear she
      would become, sooner or later, imbecile. Her eyes, which were light blue,
      and her lips, always fixed in a smile, did not contradict that idea. On
      the solemn occasion of her marriage she had the manner, air, and attitude
      of a person condemned to death, whose only desire is that it might all be
      over speedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather round,&rdquo; said Colleville to Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte was just the knife to cut into such a nature, to which her own
      formed the strongest contrast. Mademoiselle Thuillier was remarkable for
      her regular and correct beauty, but a beauty injured by toil which, from
      her very childhood, had bent her down to painful, thankless tasks, and by
      the secret privations she imposed upon herself in order to amass her
      little property. Her complexion, early discolored, had something the tint
      of steel. Her brown eyes were framed in brown; on the upper lip was a
      brown floss like a sort of smoke. Her lips were thin, and her imperious
      forehead was surmounted by hair once black, now turning to chinchilla. She
      held herself as straight as the fairest beauty; but all things else about
      her showed the hardiness of her life, the deadening of her natural fire,
      the cost of what she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      To Brigitte, Celeste was simply a fortune to lay hold of, a future mother
      to rule, one more subject in her empire. She soon reproached her for being
      <i>weak</i>, a constant word in her vocabulary, and the jealous old maid,
      who would strongly have resented any signs of activity in her
      sister-in-law, now took a savage pleasure in prodding the languid
      inertness of the feeble creature. Celeste, ashamed to see her
      sister-in-law displaying such energy in household work, endeavored to help
      her, and fell ill in consequence. Instantly, Brigitte was devoted to her,
      nursed her like a beloved sister, and would say, in presence of Thuillier:
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any strength, my child; you must never do anything again.&rdquo;
       She showed up Celeste&rsquo;s incapacity by that display of sympathy with which
      strength, seeming to pity weakness, finds means to boast of its own
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as all despotic natures liking to exercise their strength are full of
      tenderness for physical sufferings, Brigitte took such real care of her
      sister-in-law as to satisfy Celeste&rsquo;s mother when she came to see her
      daughter. After Madame Thuillier recovered, however, she called her, in
      Celeste&rsquo;s hearing, &ldquo;a helpless creature, good for nothing!&rdquo; which sent the
      poor thing crying to her room. When Thuillier found her there, drying her
      eyes, he excused her sister, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an excellent woman, but rather hasty; she loves you in her own
      way; she behaves just so with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celeste, remembering the maternal care of her sister-in-law during her
      illness, forgave the wound. Brigitte always treated her brother as the
      king of the family; she exalted him to Celeste, and made him out an
      autocrat, a Ladislas, an infallible pope. Madame Thuillier having lost her
      father and grandfather, and being well-nigh deserted by her mother, who
      came to see her on Thursdays only (she herself spending Sundays at Auteuil
      in summer), had no one left to love except her husband, and she did love
      him,&mdash;in the first place, because he was her husband, and secondly,
      because he still remained to her &ldquo;that handsome Thuillier.&rdquo; Besides, he
      sometimes treated her like a wife, and all these reasons together made her
      adore him. He seemed to her all the more perfect because he often took up
      her defence and scolded his sister, not from any real interest in his
      wife, but for pure selfishness, and in order to have peace in the
      household during the very few moments that he stayed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, that handsome Thuillier was never at home except at dinner, after
      which meal he went out, returning very late at night. He went to balls and
      other social festivities by himself, precisely as if he were still a
      bachelor. Thus the two women were always alone together. Celeste
      insensibly fell into a passive attitude, and became what Brigitte wanted
      her,&mdash;a helot. The Queen Elizabeth of the household then passed from
      despotism to a sort of pity for the poor victim who was always sacrificed.
      She ended by softening her haughty ways, her cutting speech, her
      contemptuous tones, as soon as she was certain that her sister-in-law was
      completely under the yoke. When she saw the wounds it made on the neck of
      her victim, she took care of her as a thing of her own, and Celeste
      entered upon happier days. Comparing the end with the beginning, she even
      felt a sort of love for her torturer. To gain some power of self-defence,
      to become something less a cipher in the household, supported, unknown to
      herself, by her own means, the poor helot had but a single chance, and
      that chance never came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste had no child. This barrenness, which, from month to month, brought
      floods of tears from her eyes, was long the cause of Brigitte&rsquo;s scorn; she
      reproached the poor woman bitterly for being fit for nothing, not even to
      bear children. The old maid, who had longed to love her brother&rsquo;s child as
      if it were her own, was unable, for years, to reconcile herself to this
      irremediable sterility.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when our history begins, namely, in 1840, Celeste, then
      forty-six years old, had ceased to weep; she now had the certainty of
      never being a mother. And here is a strange thing. After twenty-five years
      of this life, in which victory had ended by first dulling and then
      breaking its own knife, Brigitte loved Celeste as much as Celeste loved
      Brigitte. Time, ease, and the perpetual rubbing of domestic life, had worn
      off the angles and smoothed the asperities; Celeste&rsquo;s resignation and
      lamb-like gentleness had brought, at last, a serene and peaceful autumn.
      The two women were still further united by the one sentiment that lay
      within them, namely, their adoration for the lucky and selfish Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, these two women, both childless, had each, like all women who
      have vainly desired children, fallen in love with a child. This fictitious
      motherhood, equal in strength to a real motherhood, needs an explanation
      which will carry us to the very heart of our drama, and will show the
      reason of the new occupation which Mademoiselle Thuillier provided for her
      brother.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. COLLEVILLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thuillier had entered the ministry of finance as supernumerary at the same
      time as Colleville, who has been mentioned already as his intimate friend.
      In opposition to the well-regulated, gloomy household of Thuillier, social
      nature had provided that of Colleville; and if it is impossible not to
      remark that this fortuitous contrast was scarcely moral, we must add that,
      before deciding that point, it would be well to wait for the end of this
      drama, unfortunately too true, for which the present historian is not
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colleville was the only son of a talented musician, formerly first violin
      at the Opera under Francoeur and Rebel, who related, at least six times a
      month during his lifetime, anecdotes concerning the representations of the
      &ldquo;Village Seer&rdquo;; and mimicked Jean-Jacques Rousseau, taking him off to
      perfection. Colleville and Thuillier were inseparable friends; they had no
      secrets from each other, and their friendship, begun at fifteen years of
      age, had never known a cloud up to the year 1839. The former was one of
      those employees who are called, in the government offices, pluralists.
      These clerks are remarkable for their industry. Colleville, a good
      musician, owed to the name and influence of his father a situation as
      first clarionet at the Opera-Comique, and so long as he was a bachelor,
      Colleville, who was rather richer than Thuillier, shared his means with
      his friend. But, unlike Thuillier, Colleville married for love a
      Mademoiselle Flavie, the natural daughter of a celebrated danseuse at the
      Opera; her reputed father being a certain du Bourguier, one of the richest
      contractors of the day. In style and origin, Flavie was apparently
      destined for a melancholy career, when Colleville, often sent to her
      mother&rsquo;s apartments, fell in love with her and married her. Prince
      Galathionne, who at that time was &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; the danseuse, then
      approaching the end of her brilliant career, gave Flavie a &ldquo;dot&rdquo; of twenty
      thousand francs, to which her mother added a magnificent trousseau. Other
      friends and opera-comrades sent jewels and silver-ware, so that the
      Colleville household was far richer in superfluities than in capital.
      Flavie, brought up in opulence, began her married life in a charming
      apartment, furnished by her mother&rsquo;s upholsterer, where the young wife,
      who was full of taste for art and for artists, and possessed a certain
      elegance, ruled, a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville was pretty and piquant, clever, gay, and graceful; to
      express her in one sentence,&mdash;a charming creature. Her mother, the
      danseuse, now forty-three years old, retired from the stage and went to
      live in the country,&mdash;thus depriving her daughter of the resources
      derived from her wasteful extravagance. Madame Colleville kept a very
      agreeable but extremely free and easy household. From 1816 to 1826 she had
      five children. Colleville, a musician in the evening, kept the books of a
      merchant from seven to nine in the morning, and by ten o&rsquo;clock he was at
      his ministry. Thus, by blowing into a bit of wood by night, and writing
      double-entry accounts in the early morning, he managed to eke out his
      earnings to seven or eight thousand francs a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville played the part of a &ldquo;comme il faut&rdquo; woman; she received
      on Wednesdays, gave a concert once a month and a dinner every fortnight.
      She never saw Colleville except at dinner and at night, when he returned
      about twelve o&rsquo;clock, at which hour she was frequently not at home
      herself. She went to the theatres, where boxes were sometimes given to
      her; and she would send word to Colleville to come and fetch her from such
      or such a house, where she was supping and dancing. At her own house,
      guests found excellent cheer, and her society, though rather mixed, was
      very amusing; she received and welcomed actresses, artists, men of
      letters, and a few rich men. Madame Colleville&rsquo;s elegance was on a par
      with that of Tullia, the leading prima-donna, with whom she was intimate;
      but though the Collevilles encroached on their capital and were often in
      difficulty by the end of the month, Flavie was never in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colleville was very happy; he still loved his wife, and he made himself
      her best friend. Always received by her with affectionate smiles and
      sympathetic pleasure, he yielded readily to the irresistible grace of her
      manners. The vehement activity with which he pursued his three avocations
      was a part of his natural character and temperament. He was a fine stout
      man, ruddy, jovial, extravagant, and full of ideas. In ten years there was
      never a quarrel in his household. Among business men he was looked upon,
      in common with all artists, as a scatter-brained fellow; and superficial
      persons thought that the constant hurry of this hard worker was only the
      restless coming and going of a busybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colleville had the sense to seem stupid; he boasted of his family
      happiness, and gave himself unheard-of trouble in making anagrams, in
      order at times to seem absorbed in that passion. The government clerks of
      his division at the ministry, the office directors, and even the heads of
      divisions came to his concerts; now and then he quietly bestowed upon them
      opera tickets, when he needed some extra indulgence on account of his
      frequent absence. Rehearsals took half the time that he ought to have been
      at his desk; but the musical knowledge his father had bequeathed to him
      was sufficiently genuine and well-grounded to excuse him from all but
      final rehearsals. Thanks to Madame Colleville&rsquo;s intimacies, both the
      theatre and the ministry lent themselves kindly to the needs of this
      industrious pluralist, who, moreover, was bringing up, with great care, a
      youth, warmly recommended to him by his wife, a future great musician, who
      sometimes took his place in the orchestra with a promise of eventually
      succeeding him. In fact, about the year 1827 this young man became the
      first clarionet when Colleville resigned his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual comment on Flavie was, &ldquo;That little slip of a coquette, Madame
      Colleville.&rdquo; The eldest of the Colleville children, born in 1816, was the
      living image of Colleville himself. In 1818, Madame Colleville held the
      cavalry in high estimation, above even art; and she distinguished more
      particularly a sub-lieutenant in the dragoons of Saint-Chamans, the young
      and rich Charles de Gondreville, who afterwards died in the Spanish
      campaign. By that time Flavie had had a second son, whom she henceforth
      dedicated to a military career. In 1820 she considered banking the nursing
      mother of trade, the supporter of Nations, and she made the great Keller,
      that famous banker and orator, her idol. She then had another son, whom
      she named Francois, resolving to make him a merchant,&mdash;feeling sure
      that Keller&rsquo;s influence would never fail him. About the close of the year
      1820, Thuillier, the intimate friend of Monsieur and Madame Colleville,
      felt the need of pouring his sorrows into the bosom of this excellent
      woman, and to her he related his conjugal miseries. For six years he had
      longed to have children, but God did not bless him; although that poor
      Madame Thuillier had made novenas, and had even gone, uselessly, to
      Notra-Dame de Liesse! He depicted Celeste in various lights, which brought
      the words &ldquo;Poor Thuillier!&rdquo; from Flavie&rsquo;s lips. She herself was rather
      sad, having at the moment no dominant opinion. She poured her own griefs
      into Thuillier&rsquo;s bosom. The great Keller, that hero of the Left, was, in
      reality, extremely petty; she had learned to know the other side of public
      fame, the follies of banking, the emptiness of eloquence! The orator only
      spoke for show; to her he had behaved extremely ill. Thuillier was
      indignant. &ldquo;None but stupid fellows know how to love,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;take me!&rdquo;
       That handsome Thuillier was henceforth supposed to be paying court to
      Madame Colleville, and was rated as one of her &ldquo;attentives,&rdquo;&mdash;a word
      in vogue during the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you are after my wife,&rdquo; said Colleville, laughing. &ldquo;Take care; she&rsquo;ll
      leave you in the lurch, like all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rather clever speech, by which Colleville saved his marital dignity.
      From 1820 to 1821, Thuillier, in virtue of his title as friend of the
      family, helped Colleville, who had formerly helped him; so much so, that
      in eighteen months he had lent nearly ten thousand francs to the
      Colleville establishment, with no intention of ever claiming them. In the
      spring of 1821, Madame Colleville gave birth to a charming little girl, to
      whom Monsieur and Madame Thuillier were godfather and godmother. The child
      was baptized Celeste-Louise-Caroline-Brigitte; Mademoiselle Thuillier
      wishing that her name should be given among others to the little angel.
      The name of Caroline was a graceful attention paid to Colleville. Old
      mother Lemprun assumed the care of putting the baby to nurse under her own
      eyes at Auteuil, where Celeste and her sister-in-law Brigitte, paid it
      regularly a semi-weekly visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Madame Colleville recovered she said to Thuillier, frankly, in
      a very serious tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, if we are all to remain good friends, you must be our
      friend only. Colleville is attached to you; well, that&rsquo;s enough for you in
      this household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to me,&rdquo; said the handsome Thuillier to Tullia after this remark,
      &ldquo;why women are never attached to me. I am not the Apollo Belvidere, but
      for all that I&rsquo;m not a Vulcan; I am passably good-looking, I have sense, I
      am faithful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to tell you the truth?&rdquo; replied Tullia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, though we can, sometimes, love a stupid fellow, we never love a
      silly one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words killed Thuillier; he never got over them; henceforth he was a
      prey to melancholy and accused all women of caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary-general of the ministry, des Lupeaulx, whose influence
      Madame Colleville thought greater than it was, and of whom she said,
      later, &ldquo;That was one of my mistakes,&rdquo; became for a time the great man of
      the Colleville salon; but as Flavie found he had no power to promote
      Colleville into the upper division, she had the good sense to resent des
      Lupeaulx&rsquo;s attentions to Madame Rabourdin (whom she called a minx), to
      whose house she had never been invited, and who had twice had the
      impertinence not to come to the Colleville concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville was deeply affected by the death of young Gondreville;
      she felt, she said, the finger of God. In 1824 she turned over a new leaf,
      talked of economy, stopped her receptions, busied herself with her
      children, determined to become a good mother of a family; no favorite
      friend was seen at her house. She went to church, reformed her dress, wore
      gray, and talked Catholicism, mysticism, and so forth. All this produced,
      in 1825, another little son, whom she named Theodore. Soon after, in 1826,
      Colleville was appointed sub-director of the Clergeot division, and later,
      in 1828, collector of taxes in a Paris arrondissement. He also received
      the cross of the Legion of honor, to enable him to put his daughter at the
      royal school of Saint-Denis. The half-scholarship obtained by Keller for
      the eldest boy, Charles, was transferred to the second in 1830, when
      Charles entered the school of Saint-Louis on a full scholarship. The third
      son, taken under the protection of Madame la Dauphine, was provided with a
      three-quarter scholarship in the Henri IV. school.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1830 Colleville, who had the good fortune not to lose a child, was
      obliged, owing to his well-known attachment to the fallen royal family, to
      send in his resignation; but he was clever enough to make a bargain for
      it,&mdash;obtaining in exchange a pension of two thousand four hundred
      francs, based on his period of service, and ten thousand francs indemnity
      paid by his successor; he also received the rank of officer of the Legion
      of honor. Nevertheless, he found himself in rather a cramped condition
      when Mademoiselle Thuillier, in 1832, advised him to come and live near
      them; pointing out to him the possibility of obtaining some position in
      the mayor&rsquo;s office, which, in fact, he did obtain a few weeks later, at a
      salary of three thousand francs. Thus Thuillier and Colleville were
      destined to end their days together. In 1833 Madame Colleville, then
      thirty-five years old, settled herself in the rue d&rsquo;Enfer, at the corner
      of the rue des Deux-Eglises with Celeste and little Theodore, the other
      boys being at their several schools. Colleville was equidistant between
      the mayor&rsquo;s office and the rue Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer. Thus the
      household, after a brilliant, gay, headlong, reformed, and calmed
      existence, subsided finally into bourgeois obscurity with five thousand
      four hundred francs a year for its sole dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste was by this time twelve years of age, and she promised to be
      pretty. She needed masters, and her education ought to cost not less than
      two thousand francs a year. The mother felt the necessity of keeping her
      under the eye of her godfather and godmother. She therefore very willingly
      adopted the proposal of Mademoiselle Thuillier, who, without committing
      herself to any engagement, allowed Madame Colleville to understand that
      the fortunes of her brother, his wife, and herself would go, ultimately,
      to the little Celeste. The child had been left at Auteuil until she was
      seven years of age, adored by the good old Madame Lemprun, who died in
      1829, leaving twenty thousand francs, and a house which was sold for the
      enormous sum of twenty-eight thousand. The lively little girl had seen
      very little of her mother, but very much of Mademoiselle and Madame
      Thuillier when she first returned to the paternal mansion in 1829; but in
      1833 she fell under the dominion of Flavie, who was then, as we have said,
      endeavoring to do her duty, which, like other women instigated by remorse,
      she exaggerated. Without being an unkind mother, Flavie was very stern
      with her daughter. She remembered her own bringing-up, and swore within
      herself to make Celeste a virtuous woman. She took her to mass, and had
      her prepared for her first communion by a rector who has since become a
      bishop. Celeste was all the more readily pious, because her godmother,
      Madame Thuillier, was a saint, and the child adored her; she felt that the
      poor neglected woman loved her better than her own mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1833 to 1840 she received a brilliant education according to the
      ideas of the bourgeoisie. The best music-masters made her a fair musician;
      she could paint a water-color properly; she danced extremely well; and she
      had studied the French language, history, geography, English, Italian,&mdash;in
      short, all that constitutes the education of a well-brought-up young lady.
      Of medium height, rather plump, unfortunately near-sighted, she was
      neither plain nor pretty; not without delicacy or even brilliancy of
      complexion, it is true, but totally devoid of all distinction of manner.
      She had a great fund of reserved sensibility, and her godfather and
      godmother, Mademoiselle Thuillier and Colleville, were unanimous on one
      point,&mdash;the great resource of mothers&mdash;namely, that Celeste was
      capable of attachment. One of her beauties was a magnificent head of very
      fine blond hair; but her hands and feet showed her bourgeois origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste endeared herself by precious qualities; she was kind, simple,
      without gall of any kind; she loved her father and mother, and would
      willingly sacrifice herself for their sake. Brought up to the deepest
      admiration for her godfather by Brigitte (who taught her to say &ldquo;Aunt
      Brigitte&rdquo;), and by Madame Thuillier and her own mother, Celeste imbibed
      the highest idea of the ex-beau of the Empire. The house in the rue
      Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer produced upon her very much the effect of the
      Chateau des Tuileries on a courtier of the new dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier had not escaped the action of the administrative rolling-pin
      which thins the mind as it spreads it out. Exhausted by irksome toil, as
      much as by his life of gallantry, the ex-sub-director had well-nigh lost
      all his faculties by the time he came to live in the rue Saint-Dominique.
      But his weary face, on which there still reigned an air of imperial
      haughtiness, mingled with a certain contentment, the conceit of an upper
      official, made a deep impression upon Celeste. She alone adored that
      haggard face. The girl, moreover, felt herself to be the happiness of the
      Thuillier household.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE CIRCLE OF MONSIEUR AND MADAME THUILLIER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Collevilles and their children became, naturally, the nucleus of the
      circle which Mademoiselle Thuillier had the ambition to group around her
      brother. A former clerk in the Billardiere division of the ministry, named
      Phellion, had lived for the last thirty years in their present quarter. He
      was promptly greeted by Colleville and Thuillier at the first review.
      Phellion proved to be one of the most respected men in the arrondissement.
      He had one daughter, now married to a school-teacher in the rue
      Saint-Hyacinthe, a Monsieur Barniol. Phellion&rsquo;s eldest son was a professor
      of mathematics in a royal college; he gave lectures and private lessons,
      being devoted, so his father was wont to say, to pure mathematics. A
      second son was in the government School of Engineering. Phellion had a
      pension of nine hundred francs, and he possessed a little property of nine
      thousand and a few odd hundred francs; the fruit of his economy and that
      of his wife during thirty years of toil and privation. He was, moreover,
      the owner of a little house and garden where he lived in the &ldquo;impasse&rdquo; des
      Feuillantines,&mdash;in thirty years he had never used the old-fashioned
      word &ldquo;cul-de-sac&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dutocq, the clerk of the justice of peace, was also a former employee at
      the ministry of finance. Sacrificed, in former days, to one of those
      necessities which are always met with in representative government, he had
      accepted the position of scapegoat, receiving, privately, a round sum of
      money and the opportunity to buy his present post of clerk in the
      arrondissement. This man, not very honorable, and known to be a spy in the
      government offices, was never welcomed as he thought he ought to be by the
      Thuilliers; but the coldness of his landlords only made him the more
      persistent in going to see them. He was a bachelor and had various vices;
      he therefore concealed his life carefully, knowing well how to maintain
      his position by flattering his superiors. The justice of peace was much
      attached to Dutocq. This man, base as he was, managed, in the end, to make
      himself tolerated by the Thuilliers, chiefly by coarse and cringing
      adulation. He knew the facts of Thuillier&rsquo;s whole life, his relations with
      Colleville, and, above all, with Madame Colleville. One and all they
      feared his tongue, and the Thuilliers, without admitting him to any
      intimacy, endured his visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family which became the flower of the Thuillier salon was that of a
      former ministerial clerk, once an object of pity in the government
      offices, who, driven by poverty, left the public service, in 1827, to
      fling himself into a business enterprise, having, as he thought, an idea.
      Minard (that was his name) foresaw a fortune in one of those wicked
      conceptions which reflect such discredit on French commerce, but which, in
      the year 1827, had not yet been exposed and blasted by publicity. Minard
      bought tea and mixed it with tea-leaves already used; also he adulterated
      the elements of chocolate in a manner which enabled him to sell the
      chocolate itself very cheaply. This trade in colonial products, begun in
      the quartier Saint-Marcel, made a merchant of Minard. He started a
      factory, and through these early connections he was able to reach the
      sources of raw material. He then did honorably, and on a large scale, a
      business begun in the first instance dishonorably. He became a distiller,
      worked upon untold quantities of products, and, by the year 1835, was
      considered the richest merchant in the region of the Place Maubert. By
      that time he had bought a handsome house in the rue des Macons-Sorbonne;
      he had been assistant mayor, and in 1839 became mayor of his
      arrondissement and judge in the Court of Commerce. He kept a carriage, had
      a country-place near Lagny; his wife wore diamonds at the court balls, and
      he prided himself on the rosette of an officer of the Legion of honor in
      his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minard and his wife were exceedingly benevolent. Perhaps he wished to
      return in retail to the poor the sums he had mulcted from the public by
      the wholesale. Phellion, Colleville, and Thuillier met their old comrade,
      Minard, at election, and an intimacy followed; all the closer with the
      Thuilliers and Collevilles because Madame Minard seemed enchanted to make
      an acquaintance for her daughter in Celeste Colleville. It was at a grand
      ball given by the Minards that Celeste made her first appearance in
      society (being at that time sixteen and a half years old), dressed as her
      Christian named demanded, which seemed to be prophetic of her coming life.
      Delighted to be friendly with Mademoiselle Minard, her elder by four
      years, she persuaded her father and godfather to cultivate the Minard
      establishment, with its gilded salons and great opulence, where many
      political celebrities of the &ldquo;juste milieu&rdquo; were wont to congregate, such
      as Monsieur Popinot, who became, after a time, minister of commerce;
      Cochin, since made Baron Cochin, a former employee at the ministry of
      finance, who, having a large interest in the drug business, was now the
      oracle of the Lombard and Bourdonnais quarters, conjointly with Monsieur
      Anselme Popinot. Minard&rsquo;s eldest son, a lawyer, aiming to succeed those
      barristers who were turned down from the Palais for political reasons in
      1830, was the genius of the household, and his mother, even more than his
      father, aspired to marry him well. Zelie Minard, formerly a flower-maker,
      felt an ardent passion for the upper social spheres, and desired to enter
      them through the marriages of her son and daughter; whereas Minard, wiser
      than she, and imbued with the vigor of the middle classes, which the
      revolution of July had infiltrated into the fibres of government, thought
      only of wealth and fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frequented the Thuillier salon to gain information as to Celeste&rsquo;s
      probable inheritance. He knew, like Dutocq and Phellion, the reports
      occasioned by Thuillier&rsquo;s former intimacy with Flavie, and he saw at a
      glance the idolatry of the Thuilliers for their godchild. Dutocq, to gain
      admittance to Minard&rsquo;s house, fawned upon him grossly. When Minard, the
      Rothschild of the arrondissement, appeared at the Thuilliers&rsquo;, he compared
      him cleverly to Napoleon, finding him stout, fat, and blooming, having
      left him at the ministry thin, pale, and puny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You looked, in the division Billardiere,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like Napoleon before
      the 18th Brumaire, and I behold you now the Napoleon of the Empire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding which flattery, Minard received Dutocq very coldly and did
      not invite him to his house; consequently, he made a mortal enemy of the
      former clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur and Madame Phellion, worthy as they were, could not keep
      themselves from making calculations and cherishing hopes; they thought
      that Celeste would be the very wife for their son the professor;
      therefore, to have, as it were, a watcher in the Thuillier salon, they
      introduced their son-in-law, Monsieur Barniol, a man much respected in the
      faubourg Saint-Jacques, and also an old employee at the mayor&rsquo;s office, an
      intimate friend of theirs, named Laudigeois. Thus the Phellions formed a
      phalanx of seven persons; the Collevilles were not less numerous; so that
      on Sundays it often appeared that thirty persons were assembled in the
      Thuillier salon. Thuillier renewed acquaintance with the Saillards,
      Baudoyers, and Falleixs,&mdash;all persons of respectability in the
      quarter of the Palais-Royal, whom they often invited to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville was, as a woman, the most distinguished member of this
      society, just as Minard junior and Professor Phellion were superior among
      the men. All the others, without ideas or education, and issuing from the
      lower ranks, presented the types and the absurdities of the lesser
      bourgeoisie. Though all success, especially if won from distant sources,
      seems to presuppose some genuine merit, Minard was really an inflated
      balloon. Expressing himself in empty phrases, mistaking sycophancy for
      politeness, and wordiness for wit, he uttered his commonplaces with a
      brisk assurance that passed for eloquence. Certain words which said
      nothing but answered all things,&mdash;progress, steam, bitumen, National
      guard, order, democratic element, spirit of association, legality,
      movement, resistance,&mdash;seemed, as each political phase developed, to
      have been actually made for Minard, whose talk was a paraphrase on the
      ideas of his newspaper. Julien Minard, the young lawyer, suffered from his
      father as much as his father suffered from his wife. Zelie had grown
      pretentious with wealth, without, at the same time, learning to speak
      French. She was now very fat, and gave the idea, in her rich surroundings,
      of a cook married to her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phellion, that type and model of the petty bourgeois, exhibited as many
      virtues as he did absurdities. Accustomed to subordination during his
      bureaucratic life, he respected all social superiority. He was therefore
      silent before Minard. During the critical period of retirement from
      office, he had held his own admirably, for the following reason. Never
      until now had that worthy and excellent man been able to indulge his own
      tastes. He loved the city of Paris; he was interested in its
      embellishment, in the laying out of its streets; he was capable of
      standing for hours to watch the demolition of houses. He might now have
      been observed, stolidly planted on his legs, his nose in the air, watching
      for the fall of a stone which some mason was loosening at the top of a
      wall, and never moving till the stone fell; when it had fallen he went
      away as happy as an academician at the fall of a romantic drama. Veritable
      supernumeraries of the social comedy, Phellion, Laudigeois, and their
      kind, fulfilled the functions of the antique chorus. They wept when
      weeping was in order, laughed when they should laugh, and sang in parts
      the public joys and sorrows; they triumphed in their corner with the
      triumphs of Algiers, of Constantine, of Lisbon, of Sainte-Jean d&rsquo;Ulloa;
      they deplored the death of Napoleon and the fatal catastrophes of the
      Saint-Merri and the rue Transnonnain, grieving over celebrated men who
      were utterly unknown to them. Phellion alone presents a double side: he
      divides himself conscientiously between the reasons of the opposition and
      those of the government. When fighting went on in the streets, Phellion
      had the courage to declare himself before his neighbors; he went to the
      Place Saint-Michel, the place where his battalion assembled; he felt for
      the government and did his duty. Before and during the riot, he supported
      the dynasty, the product of July; but, as soon as the political trials
      began, he stood by the accused. This innocent &ldquo;weather-cockism&rdquo; prevails
      in his political opinions; he produces, in reply to all arguments, the
      &ldquo;colossus of the North.&rdquo; England is, to his thinking, as to that of the
      old &ldquo;Constitutionnel,&rdquo; a crone with two faces,&mdash;Machiavellian Albion,
      and the model nation: Machiavellian, when the interests of France and of
      Napoleon are concerned; the model nation when the faults of the government
      are in question. He admits, with his chosen paper, the democratic element,
      but refuses in conversation all compact with the republican spirit. The
      republican spirit to him means 1793, rioting, the Terror, and agrarian
      law. The democratic element is the development of the lesser bourgeoisie,
      the reign of Phellions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy old man is always dignified; dignity serves to explain his
      life. He has brought up his children with dignity; he has kept himself a
      father in their eyes; he insists on being honored in his home, just as he
      himself honors power and his superiors. He has never made debts. As a
      juryman his conscience obliges him to sweat blood and water in the effort
      to follow the debates of a trial; he never laughs, not even if the judge,
      and audience, and all the officials laugh. Eminently useful, he gives his
      services, his time, everything&mdash;except his money. Felix Phellion, his
      son, the professor, is his idol; he thinks him capable of attaining to the
      Academy of Sciences. Thuillier, between the audacious nullity of Minard,
      and the solid silliness of Phellion, was a neutral substance, but
      connected with both through his dismal experience. He managed to conceal
      the emptiness of his brain by commonplace talk, just as he covered the
      yellow skin of his bald pate with thready locks of his gray hair, brought
      from the back of his head with infinite art by the comb of his
      hairdresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any other career,&rdquo; he was wont to say, speaking of the government
      employ, &ldquo;I should have made a very different fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seen the <i>right</i>, which is possible in theory and impossible
      in practice,&mdash;results proving contrary to premises,&mdash;and he
      related the intrigues and the injustices of the Rabourdin affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, one can believe all, and believe nothing,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;Ah!
      it is a queer thing, government! I&rsquo;m very glad not to have a son, and
      never to see him in the career of a place-hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colleville, ever gay, rotund, and good-humored, a sayer of &ldquo;quodlibets,&rdquo; a
      maker of anagrams, always busy, represented the capable and bantering
      bourgeois, with faculty without success, obstinate toil without result; he
      was also the embodiment of jovial resignation, mind without object, art
      with usefulness, for, excellent musician that he was, he never played now
      except for his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thuillier salon was in some sort a provincial salon, lighted, however,
      by continual flashes from the Parisian conflagration; its mediocrity and
      its platitudes followed the current of the times. The popular saying and
      thing (for in Paris the thing and its saying are like the horse and its
      rider) ricochetted, so to speak, to this company. Monsieur Minard was
      always impatiently expected, for he was certain to know the truth of
      important circumstances. The women of the Thuillier salon held by the
      Jesuits; the men defended the University; and, as a general thing, the
      women listened. A man of intelligence (could he have borne the dulness of
      these evenings) would have laughed, as he would at a comedy of Moliere, on
      hearing, amid endless discussion, such remarks as the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could the Revolution of 1789 have been avoided? The loans of Louis
      XIV. prepared the way for it. Louis XV., an egotist, a man of narrow mind
      (didn&rsquo;t he say, &lsquo;If I were lieutenant of police I would suppress
      cabriolets&rsquo;?), that dissolute king&mdash;you remember his Parc aux Cerfs?&mdash;did
      much to open the abyss of revolution. Monsieur de Necker, an evil-minded
      Genovese, set the thing a-going. Foreigners have always tried to injure
      France. The maximum did great harm to the Revolution. Legally Louis XVI.
      should never have been condemned; a jury would have acquitted him. Why did
      Charles X. fall? Napoleon was a great man, and the facts that prove his
      genius are anecdotal: he took five pinches of snuff a minute out of a
      pocket lined with leather made in his waistcoat. He looked into all his
      tradesmen&rsquo;s accounts; he went to Saint-Denis to judge for himself the
      prices of things. Talma was his friend; Talma taught him his gestures;
      nevertheless, he always refused to give Talma the Legion of honor! The
      emperor mounted guard for a sentinel who went to sleep, to save him from
      being shot. Those were the things that made his soldiers adore him. Louis
      XVIII., who certainly had some sense, was very unjust in calling him
      Monsieur de Buonaparte. The defect of the present government is in letting
      itself be led instead of leading. It holds itself too low. It is afraid of
      men of energy. It ought to have torn up all the treaties of 1815 and
      demanded the Rhine. They keep the same men too long in the ministry&rdquo;;
      etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;ve exerted your minds long enough,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle
      Thuillier, interrupting one of these luminous talks; &ldquo;the altar is
      dressed; begin your little game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If these anterior facts and all these generalities were not placed here as
      the frame of the present Scene, to give an idea of the spirit of this
      society, the following drama would certainly have suffered greatly.
      Moreover, this sketch is historically faithful; it shows a social stratum
      of importance in any portrayal of manners and morals, especially when we
      reflect that the political system of the Younger branch rests almost
      wholly upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter of the year 1839 was, it may be said, the period when the
      Thuillier salon was in its greatest glory. The Minards came nearly every
      Sunday, and began their evening by spending an hour there, if they had
      other engagements elsewhere. Often Minard would leave his wife at the
      Thuilliers and take his son and daughter to other houses. This assiduity
      on the part of the Minards was brought about by a somewhat tardy meeting
      between Messieurs Metivier, Barbet, and Minard on an evening when the two
      former, being tenants of Mademoiselle Thuillier, remained rather longer
      than usual in discussing business with her. From Barbet, Minard learned
      that the old maid had money transactions with himself and Metivier to the
      amount of sixty thousand francs, besides having a large deposit in the
      Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she an account at the Bank?&rdquo; asked Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; replied Barbet. &ldquo;I give her at least eighty thousand
      francs there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being on intimate terms with a governor of the Bank, Minard ascertained
      that Mademoiselle Thuillier had, in point of fact, an account of over two
      hundred thousand francs, the result of her quarterly deposits for many
      years. Besides this, she owned the house they lived in, which was not
      mortgaged, and was worth at least one hundred thousand francs, if not
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should Mademoiselle Thuillier work in this way?&rdquo; said Minard to
      Metivier. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be a good match for you,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? oh, no,&rdquo; replied Metivier. &ldquo;I shall do better by marrying a cousin; my
      uncle Metivier has given me the succession to his business; he has a
      hundred thousand francs a year and only two daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However secretive Mademoiselle Thuillier might be,&mdash;and she said
      nothing of her investments to any one, not even to her brother, although a
      large amount of Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s fortune went to swell the amount of her
      own savings,&mdash;it was difficult to prevent some ray of light from
      gliding under the bushel which covered her treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dutocq, who frequented Barbet, with whom he had some resemblance in
      character and countenance, had appraised, even more correctly than Minard,
      the Thuillier finances. He knew that their savings amounted, in 1838, to
      one hundred and fifty thousand francs, and he followed their progress
      secretly, calculating profits by the help of that all-wise money-lender,
      Barbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste will have from my brother and myself two hundred thousand francs
      in ready money,&rdquo; the old maid had said to Barbet in confidence, &ldquo;and
      Madame Thuillier wishes to secure to her by the marriage contract the
      ultimate possession of her own fortune. As for me, my will is made. My
      brother will have everything during his lifetime, and Celeste will be my
      heiress with that reservation. Monsieur Cardot, the notary, is my
      executor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Thuillier now instigated her brother to renew his former
      relations with the Saillards, Baudoyers, and others, who held a position
      similar to that of the Thuilliers in the quartier Saint-Antoine, of which
      Monsieur Saillard was mayor. Cardot, the notary, had produced his aspirant
      for Celeste&rsquo;s hand in the person of Monsieur Godeschal, attorney and
      successor to Derville; an able man, thirty-six years of age, who had paid
      one hundred thousand francs for his practice, which the two hundred
      thousand of the &ldquo;dot&rdquo; would doubly clear off. Minard, however, got rid of
      Godeschal by informing Mademoiselle Thuillier that Celeste&rsquo;s sister-in-law
      would be the famous Mariette of the Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came from the stage,&rdquo; said Colleville, alluding to his wife, &ldquo;and
      there&rsquo;s no need she should return to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Monsieur Godeschal is too old for Celeste,&rdquo; remarked Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ought we not,&rdquo; added Madame Thuillier, timidly, &ldquo;to let her marry
      according to her own taste, so as to be happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman had detected in Felix Phellion a true love for Celeste; the
      love that a woman crushed by Brigitte and wounded by her husband&rsquo;s
      indifference (for Thuillier cared less for his wife than he did for a
      servant) had dreamed that love might be,&mdash;bold in heart, timid
      externally, sure of itself, reserved, hidden from others, but expanding
      toward heaven. At twenty-three years of age, Felix Phellion was a gentle,
      pure-minded young man, like all true scholars who cultivate knowledge for
      knowledge&rsquo;s sake. He had been sacredly brought up by his father, who,
      viewing all things seriously, had given him none but good examples
      accompanied by trivial maxims. He was a young man of medium height, with
      light chestnut hair, gray eyes, and a skin full of freckles; gifted with a
      charming voice, a tranquil manner; making few gestures; thoughtful, saying
      little, and that little sensible; contradicting no one, and quite
      incapable of a sordid thought or a selfish calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; thought Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;is what I should have liked my husband
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening, in the month of February, 1840, the Thuillier salon contained
      the various personages whose silhouettes we have just traced out, together
      with some others. It was nearly the end of the month. Barbet and Metivier
      having business with mademoiselle Brigitte, were playing whist with Minard
      and Phellion. At another table were Julien the advocate (a nickname given
      by Colleville to young Minard), Madame Colleville, Monsieur Barniol, and
      Madame Phellion. &ldquo;Bouillotte,&rdquo; at five sous a stake, occupied Madame
      Minard, who knew no other game, Colleville, old Monsieur Saillard, and
      Bandoze, his son-in-law. The substitutes were Laudigeois and Dutocq.
      Mesdames Falleix, Baudoyer, Barniol, and Mademoiselle Minard were playing
      boston, and Celeste was sitting beside Prudence Minard. Young Phellion was
      listening to Madame Thuillier and looking at Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a corner of the fireplace sat enthroned on a sofa the Queen Elizabeth
      of the family, as simply dressed as she had been for the last thirty
      years; for no prosperity could have made her change her habits. She wore
      on her chinchilla hair a black gauze cap, adorned with the geranium called
      Charles X.; her gown, of plum-colored stuff, made with a yoke, cost
      fifteen francs, her embroidered collarette was worth six, and it ill
      disguised the deep wrinkle produced by the two muscles which fastened the
      head to the vertebral column. The actor, Monvel, playing Augustus Caesar
      in his old age, did not present a harder and sterner profile than that of
      this female autocrat, knitting socks for her brother. Before the fireplace
      stood Thuillier in an attitude, ready to go forward and meet the arriving
      guests; near him was a young man whose entrance had produced a great
      effect, when the porter (who on Sundays wore his best clothes and waited
      on the company) announced Monsieur Olivier Vinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A private communication made by Cardot to the celebrated
      &ldquo;procureur-general,&rdquo; father of this young man, was the cause of his visit.
      Olivier Vinet had just been promoted from the court of Arcis-sur-Aube to
      that of the Seine, where he now held the post of substitute
      &ldquo;procureur-de-roi.&rdquo; Cardot had already invited Thuillier and the elder
      Vinet, who was likely to become minister of justice, with his son, to dine
      with him. The notary estimated the fortunes which would eventually fall to
      Celeste at seven hundred thousand francs. Vinet junior appeared charmed to
      obtain the right to visit the Thuilliers on Sundays. Great dowries make
      men commit great and unbecoming follies without reserve or decency in
      these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later another young man, who had been talking with Thuillier
      before the arrival of Olivier Vinet, raised his voice eagerly, in a
      political discussion, and forced the young magistrate to follow his
      example in the vivacious argument which now ensued. The matter related to
      the vote by which the Chamber of Deputies had just overthrown the ministry
      of the 12th of May, refusing the allowance demanded for the Duc de
      Nemours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I am far from belonging to the dynastic
      party; I am very far from approving of the rise of the bourgeoisie to
      power. The bourgeoisie ought not, any more than the aristocracy of other
      days, to assume to be the whole nation. But the French bourgeoisie has now
      taken upon itself to create a new dynasty, a royalty of its own, and
      behold how it treats it! When the people allowed Napoleon to rise to
      power, it created with him a splendid and monumental state of things; it
      was proud of his grandeur; and it nobly gave its blood and sweat in
      building up the edifice of the Empire. Between the magnificence of the
      aristocratic throne and those of the imperial purple, between the great of
      the earth and the People, the bourgeoisie is proving itself petty; it
      degrades power to its own level instead of rising up to it. The saving of
      candle-ends it has so long practised behind its counters, it now seeks to
      impose on its princes. What may perhaps have been virtue in its shops is a
      blunder and a crime higher up. I myself have wanted many things for the
      people, but I never should have begun by lopping off ten millions of
      francs from the new civil list. In becoming, as it were, nearly the whole
      of France, the bourgeoisie owed to us the prosperity of the people,
      splendor without ostentation, grandeur without privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father of Olivier Vinet was just now sulking with the government. The
      robe of Keeper of the Seals, which had been his dream, was slow in coming
      to him. The young substitute did not, therefore, know exactly how to
      answer this speech; he thought it wise to enlarge on one of its side
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, monsieur,&rdquo; said Olivier Vinet. &ldquo;But, before manifesting
      itself magnificently, the bourgeoisie has other duties to fulfil towards
      France. The luxury you speak of should come after duty. That which seems
      to you so blameable is the necessity of the moment. The Chamber is far
      from having its full share in public affairs; the ministers are less for
      France than they are for the crown, and parliament has determined that the
      administration shall have, as in England, a strength and power of its own,
      and not a mere borrowed power. The day on which the administration can act
      for itself, and represent the Chamber as the Chamber represents the
      country, parliament will be found very liberal toward the crown. The whole
      question is there. I state it without expressing my own opinion, for the
      duties of my post demand, in politics, a certain fealty to the crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Setting aside the political question,&rdquo; replied the young man, whose voice
      and accent were those of a native of Provence, &ldquo;it is certainly true that
      the bourgeoisie has ill understood its mission. We can see, any day, the
      great law officers, attorney-generals, peers of France in omnibuses,
      judges who live on their salaries, prefects without fortunes, ministers in
      debt! Whereas the bourgeoisie, who have seized upon those offices, ought
      to dignify them, as in the olden time when aristocracy dignified them, and
      not occupy such posts solely for the purpose of making their fortune, as
      scandalous disclosures have proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this young man?&rdquo; thought Olivier Vinet. &ldquo;Is he a relative? Cardot
      ought to have come with me on this first visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that little monsieur?&rdquo; asked Minard of Barbet. &ldquo;I have seen him
      here several times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a tenant,&rdquo; replied Metivier, shuffling the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lawyer,&rdquo; added Barbet, in a low voice, &ldquo;who occupies a small apartment
      on the third floor front. Oh! <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t amount to much; he has
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of that young man?&rdquo; said Olivier Vinet to Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodose de la Peyrade; he is a barrister,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the women present, as well as the men, looked at the two
      young fellows, and Madame Minard remarked to Colleville:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rather good-looking, that stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made his anagram,&rdquo; replied Colleville, &ldquo;and his name,
      Charles-Marie-Theodose de la Peyrade, prophecies: &lsquo;Eh! monsieur payera, de
      la dot, des oies et le char.&rsquo; Therefore, my dear Mamma Minard, be sure you
      don&rsquo;t give him your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that young man is better-looking than my son,&rdquo; said Madame
      Phellion to Madame Colleville. &ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in the matter of physical beauty a woman might hesitate before
      choosing,&rdquo; replied Madame Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment it occurred to young Vinet as he looked round the salon, so
      full of the lesser bourgeoisie, that it might be a shrewd thing to magnify
      that particular class; and he thereupon enlarged upon the meaning of the
      young Provencal barrister, declaring that men so honored by the confidence
      of the government should imitate royalty and encourage a magnificence
      surpassing that of the former court. It was folly, he said, to lay by the
      emoluments of an office. Besides, could it be done, in Paris especially,
      where costs of living had trebled,&mdash;the apartment of a magistrate,
      for instance, costing three thousand francs a year?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;allows me three thousand francs a
      year, and that, with my salary, barely allows me to maintain my rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the young substitute rode boldly into this bog-hole, the Provencal,
      who had slyly enticed him there, exchanged, without being observed, a wink
      with Dutocq, who was just then waiting for the place of a player at
      bouillotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a demand for offices,&rdquo; remarked the latter, &ldquo;that they talk
      of creating two justices of the peace to each arrondissement in order to
      make a dozen new clerkships. As if they could interfere with our rights
      and our salaries, which already require an exhorbitant tax!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet had the pleasure of hearing you at the Palais,&rdquo; said Vinet
      to Monsieur de la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am advocate for the poor, and I plead only before the justice of
      peace,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Thuillier, as she listened to young Vinet&rsquo;s theory of the
      necessity of spending an income, assumed a distant air and manner, the
      significance of which was well understood by Dutocq and the young
      Provencal. Vinet left the house in company with Minard and Julien the
      advocate, so that the battle-field before the fire-place was abandoned to
      la Peyrade and Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The upper bourgeoisie,&rdquo; said Dutocq to Thuillier, &ldquo;will behave, in
      future, exactly like the old aristocracy. The nobility wanted girls with
      money to manure their lands, and the parvenus of to-day want the same to
      feather their nests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what Monsieur Thuillier was saying to me this morning,&rdquo;
       remarked la Peyrade, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vinet&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;married a Demoiselle de Chargeboeuf and
      has caught the opinions of the nobility; he wants a fortune at any price;
      his wife spends money regally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Thuillier, in whom the jealousy between the two classes of the
      bourgeoisie was fully roused, &ldquo;take offices away from those fellows and
      they&rsquo;d fall back where they came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was knitting with such precipitous haste that she seemed to
      be propelled by a steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my place, Monsieur Dutocq,&rdquo; said Madame Minard, rising. &ldquo;My feet are
      cold,&rdquo; she added, going to the fire, where the golden ornaments of her
      turban made fireworks in the light of the Saint-Aurora wax-candles that
      were struggling vainly to light the vast salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very small fry, that young substitute,&rdquo; said Madame Minard,
      glancing at Mademoiselle Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small fry!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade. &ldquo;Ah, madame! how witty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But madame has so long accustomed us to that sort of thing,&rdquo; said the
      handsome Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville was examining la Peyrade and comparing him with young
      Phellion, who was just then talking to Celeste, neither of them paying any
      heed to what was going on around them. This is, certainly, the right
      moment to depict the singular personage who was destined to play a signal
      part in the Thuillier household, and who fully deserves the appellation of
      a great artist.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. A PRINCIPAL PERSONAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There exists in Provence, especially about Avignon, a race of men with
      blond or chestnut hair, fair skin, and eyes that are almost tender, their
      pupils calm, feeble, or languishing, rather than keen, ardent, or
      profound, as they usually are in the eyes of Southerners. Let us remark,
      in passing, that among Corsicans, a race subject to fits of anger and
      dangerous irascibility, we often meet with fair skins and physical natures
      of the same apparent tranquillity. These pale men, rather stout, with
      somewhat dim and hazy eyes either green or blue, are the worst species of
      humanity in Provence; and Charles-Marie-Theodose de la Peyrade presents a
      fine type of that race, the constitution of which deserves careful
      examination on the part of medical science and philosophical physiology.
      There rises, at times, within such men, a species of bile,&mdash;a bitter
      gall, which flies to their head and makes them capable of ferocious
      actions, done, apparently, in cold blood. Being the result of an inward
      intoxication, this sort of dumb violence seems to be irreconcilable with
      their quasi-lymphatic outward man, and the tranquillity of their benignant
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born in the neighborhood of Avignon, the young Provencal whose name we
      have just mentioned was of middle height, well-proportioned, and rather
      stout; the tone of his skin had no brilliancy; it was neither livid nor
      dead-white, nor colored, but gelatinous,&mdash;that word can alone give a
      true idea of the flabby, hueless envelope, beneath which were concealed
      nerves that were less vigorous than capable of enormous resistance at
      certain given moments. His eyes, of a pale cold blue, expressed in their
      ordinary condition a species of deceptive sadness, which must have had
      great charms for women. The forehead, finely cut, was not without dignity,
      and it harmonized well with the soft, light chestnut hair curling
      naturally, but slightly, at its tips. The nose, precisely like that of a
      hunting dog, flat and furrowed at the tip, inquisitive, intelligent,
      searching, always on the scent, instead of expressing good-humor, was
      ironical and mocking; but this particular aspect of his nature never
      showed itself openly; the young man must have ceased to watch himself, he
      must have flown into fury before the power came to him to flash out the
      sarcasm and the wit which embittered, tenfold, his infernal humor. The
      mouth, the curving lines and pomegranate-colored lips of which were very
      pleasing, seemed the admirable instrument of an organ that was almost
      sweet in its middle tones, where its owner usually kept it, but which, in
      its higher key, vibrated on the ear like the sound of a gong. This
      falsetto was the voice of his nerves and his anger. His face, kept
      expressionless by an inward command, was oval in form. His manners, in
      harmony with the sacerdotal calmness of the face, were reserved and
      conventional; but he had supple, pliant ways which, though they never
      descended to wheedling, were not lacking in seduction; although as soon as
      his back was turned their charm seemed inexplicable. Charm, when it takes
      its rise in the heart, leaves deep and lasting traces; that which is
      merely a product of art, or of eloquence, has only a passing power; it
      produces its immediate effect, and that is all. But how many philosophers
      are there in life who are able to distinguish the difference? Almost
      always the trick is played (to use a popular expression) before the
      ordinary run of men have perceived its methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything about this young man of twenty-seven was in harmony with his
      character; he obeyed his vocation by cultivating philanthropy,&mdash;the
      only expression which explains the philanthropist. Theodose loved the
      People, for he limited his love for humanity. Like the horticulturist who
      devotes himself to roses, or dahlias, or heart&rsquo;s-ease, or geraniums, and
      pays no attention to the plants his fancy has not selected, so this young
      La Rochefoucault-Liancourt gave himself to the workingmen, the proletariat
      and the paupers of the faubourgs Saint-Jacques and Saint-Marceau. The
      strong man, the man of genius at bay, the worthy poor of the bourgeois
      class, he cut them off from the bosom of his charity. The heart of all
      persons with a mania is like those boxes with compartments, in which
      sugarplums are kept in sorts: &ldquo;suum cuique tribuere&rdquo; is their motto; they
      measure to each duty its dose. There are some philanthropists who pity
      nothing but the man condemned to death. Vanity is certainly the basis of
      philanthropy; but in the case of this Provencal it was calculation, a
      predetermined course, a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; and democratic hypocrisy, played with a
      perfection that no other actor will ever attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodose did not attack the rich; he contented himself with not
      understanding them; he endured them; every one, in his opinion, ought to
      enjoy the fruits of his labor. He had been, he said, a fervent disciple of
      Saint-Simon, but that mistake must be attributed to his youth: modern
      society could have no other basis than heredity. An ardent Catholic, like
      all men from the Comtat, he went to the earliest morning masses, and thus
      concealed his piety. Like other philanthropists, he practised a sordid
      economy, and gave to the poor his time, his legal advice, his eloquence,
      and such money as he extracted for them from the rich. His clothes, always
      of black cloth, were worn until the seams became white. Nature had done a
      great deal for Theodose in not giving him that fine manly Southern beauty
      which creates in others an imaginary expectation, to which it is more than
      difficult for a man to respond. As it was, he could be what suited him at
      the moment,&mdash;an agreeable man or a very ordinary one. Never, since
      his admission to the Thuilliers&rsquo;, had he ventured, till this evening, to
      raise his voice and speak as dogmatically as he had risked doing to
      Olivier Vinet; but perhaps Theodose de la Peyrade was not sorry to seize
      the opportunity to come out from the shade in which he had hitherto kept
      himself. Besides, it was necessary to get rid of the young substitute,
      just as the Minards had previously ruined the hopes of Monsieur Godeschal.
      Like all superior men (for he certainly had some superiority), Vinet had
      never lowered himself to the point where the threads of these bourgeois
      spider-webs became visible to him, and he had therefore plunged, like a
      fly, headforemost, into the almost invisible trap to which Theodose
      inveigled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete this portrait of the poor man&rsquo;s lawyer we must here relate the
      circumstances of his first arrival at the Thuilliers&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodose came to lodge in Mademoiselle Thuillier&rsquo;s house toward the close
      of the year 1837. He had taken his degree about five years earlier, and
      had kept the proper number of terms to become a barrister. Circumstances,
      however, about which he said nothing, had interfered to prevent his being
      called to the bar; he was, therefore, still a licentiate. But soon after
      he was installed in the little apartment on the third floor, with the
      furniture rigorously required by all members of his noble profession,&mdash;for
      the guild of barristers admits no brother unless he has a suitable study,
      a legal library, and can thus, as it were, verify his claims,&mdash;Theodose
      de la Peyrade began to practise as a barrister before the Royal Court of
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the year 1838 was employed in making this change in his
      condition, and he led a most regular life. He studied at home in the
      mornings till dinner-time, going sometimes to the Palais for important
      cases. Having become very intimate with Dutocq (so Dutocq said), he did
      certain services to the poor of the faubourg Saint-Jacques who were
      brought to his notice by that official. He pleaded their cases before the
      court, after bringing them to the notice of the attorneys, who, according
      to the statutes of their order, are obliged to take turns in doing
      business for the poor. As Theodose was careful to plead only safe cases,
      he won them all. Those persons whom he thus obliged expressed their
      gratitude and their admiration, in spite of the young lawyer&rsquo;s
      admonitions, among their own class, and to the porters of private houses,
      through whom many anecdotes rose to the ears of the proprietors. Delighted
      to have in their house a tenant so worthy and so charitable, the
      Thuilliers wished to attract him to their salon, and they questioned
      Dutocq about him. The mayor&rsquo;s clerk replied as the envious reply; while
      doing justice to the young man he dwelt on his remarkable avarice, which
      might, however, be the effect of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had other information about him. He belongs to the Peyrades, an
      old family of the &lsquo;comtat&rsquo; of Avignon; he came here toward the end of
      1829, to inquire about an uncle whose fortune was said to be considerable;
      he discovered the address of the old man only three days before his death;
      and the furniture of the deceased merely sufficed to bury him and pay his
      debts. A friend of this useless uncle gave a couple of hundred louis to
      the poor fortune-hunter, advising him to finish his legal studies and
      enter the judiciary career. Those two hundred louis supported him for
      three years in Paris, where he lived like an anchorite. But being unable
      to discover his unknown friend and benefactor, the poor student was in
      abject distress in 1833. He worked then, like so many other licentiates,
      in politics and literature, by which he kept himself for a time above want&mdash;for
      he had nothing to expect from his family. His father, the youngest brother
      of the dead uncle, has eleven other children, who live on a small estate
      called Les Canquoelles. He finally obtained a place on a ministerial
      newspaper, the manager of which was the famous Cerizet, so celebrated for
      the persecutions he met with, under the Restoration, on account of his
      attachment to the liberals,&mdash;a man whom the new Left will never
      forgive for having made his paper ministerial. As the government of these
      days does very little to protect even its most devoted servants (witness
      the Gisquet affair), the republicans have ended by ruining Cerizet. I tell
      you this to explain how it is that Cerizet is now a copying clerk in my
      office. Well, in the days when he flourished as managing editor of a paper
      directed by the Perier ministry against the incendiary journals, the
      &lsquo;Tribune&rsquo; and others, Cerizet, who is a worthy fellow after all, though he
      is too fond of women, pleasure, and good living, was very useful to
      Theodose, who edited the political department of the paper; and if it
      hadn&rsquo;t been for the death of Casimir Perier that young man would certainly
      have received an appointment as substitute judge in Paris. As it was, he
      dropped back in 1834-35, in spite of his talent; for his connection with a
      ministerial journal of course did him harm. &lsquo;If it had not been for my
      religious principles,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;I should have thrown myself into
      the Seine.&rsquo; However, it seems that the friend of his uncle must have heard
      of his distress, for again he sent him a sum of money; enough to complete
      his terms for the bar; but, strange to say, he has never known the name or
      the address of this mysterious benefactor. After all, perhaps, under such
      circumstances, his economy is excusable, and he must have great strength
      of mind to refuse what the poor devils whose cases he wins by his devotion
      offer him. He is indignant at the way other lawyers speculate on the
      possibility or impossibility of poor creatures, unjustly sued, paying for
      the costs of their defence. Oh! he&rsquo;ll succeed in the end. I shouldn&rsquo;t be
      surprised to see that fellow in some very brilliant position; he has
      tenacity, honesty, and courage. He studies, he delves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the favor with which he was greeted, la Peyrade went
      discreetly to the Thuilliers&rsquo;. When reproached for this reserve he went
      oftener, and ended by appearing every Sunday; he was invited to all
      dinner-parties, and became at last so familiar in the house that whenever
      he came to see Thuillier about four o&rsquo;clock he was always requested to
      take &ldquo;pot-luck&rdquo; without ceremony. Mademoiselle Thuillier used to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we know that he will get a good dinner, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A social phenomenon which has certainly been observed, but never, as yet,
      formulated, or, if you like it better, published, though it fully deserves
      to be recorded, is the return of habits, mind, and manners to primitive
      conditions in certain persons who, between youth and old age, have raised
      themselves above their first estate. Thus Thuillier had become, once more,
      morally speaking, the son of a concierge. He now made use of many of his
      father&rsquo;s jokes, and a little of the slime of early days was beginning to
      appear on the surface of his declining life. About five or six times a
      month, when the soup was rich and good he would deposit his spoon in his
      empty plate and say, as if the proposition were entirely novel:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than a kick on the shin-bone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing that witticism for the first time Theodose, to whom it was
      really new, laughed so heartily that the handsome Thuillier was tickled in
      his vanity as he had never been before. After that, Theodose greeted the
      same speech with a knowing little smile. This slight detail will explain
      how it was that on the morning of the day when Theodose had his passage at
      arms with Vinet he had said to Thuillier, as they were walking in the
      garden to see the effect of a frost:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have much more wit than you give yourself credit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which he received this answer:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any other career, my dear Theodose, I should have made my way nobly;
      but the fall of the Emperor broke my neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still time,&rdquo; said the young lawyer. &ldquo;In the first place, what
      did that mountebank, Colleville, ever do to get the cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There la Peyrade laid his finger on a sore wound which Thuillier hid from
      every eye so carefully that even his sister did not know of it; but the
      young man, interested in studying these bourgeois, had divined the secret
      envy that gnawed at the heart of the ex-official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you, experienced as you are, will do the honor to follow my advice,&rdquo;
       added the philanthropist, &ldquo;and, above all, not mention our compact to any
      one, I will undertake to have you decorated with the Legion of honor, to
      the applause of the whole quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if we succeed in that,&rdquo; cried Thuillier, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what I would
      do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explains why Thuillier carried his head high when Theodose had the
      audacity that evening to put opinions into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In art&mdash;and perhaps Moliere had placed hypocrisy in the rank of art
      by classing Tartuffe forever among comedians&mdash;there exists a point of
      perfection to which genius alone attains; mere talent falls below it.
      There is so little difference between a work of genius and a work of
      talent, that only men of genius can appreciate the distance that separates
      Raffaelle from Correggio, Titian from Rubens. More than that; common minds
      are easily deceived on this point. The sign of genius is a certain
      appearance of facility. In fact, its work must appear, at first sight,
      ordinary, so natural is it, even on the highest subjects. Many
      peasant-women hold their children as the famous Madonna in the Dresden
      gallery holds hers. Well, the height of art in a man of la Peyrade&rsquo;s force
      was to oblige others to say of him later: &ldquo;Everybody would have been taken
      in by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the salon Thuillier, he noted a dawning opposition; he perceived
      in Colleville the somewhat clear-sighted and criticising nature of an
      artist who has missed his vocation. The barrister felt himself displeasing
      to Colleville, who (as the result of circumstances not necessary to here
      report) considered himself justified in believing in the science of
      anagrams. None of this anagrams had ever failed. The clerks in the
      government office had laughed at him when, demanding an anagram on the
      name of the poor helpless Auguste-Jean-Francois Minard, he had produced,
      &ldquo;J&rsquo;amassai une si grande fortune&rdquo;; and the event had justified him after
      the lapse of ten years! Theodose, on several occasions, had made advances
      to the jovial secretary of the mayor&rsquo;s office, and had felt himself
      rebuffed by a coldness which was not natural in so sociable a man. When
      the game of bouillotte came to an end, Colleville seized the moment to
      draw Thuillier into the recess of a window and say to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are letting that lawyer get too much foothold in your house; he kept
      the ball in his own hands all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my friend; forewarned is forearmed,&rdquo; replied Thuillier,
      inwardly scoffing at Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodose, who was talking at the moment to Madame Colleville, had his eye
      on the two men, and, with the same prescience by which women know when and
      how they are spoken of, he perceived that Colleville was trying to injure
      him in the mind of the weak and silly Thuillier. &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said in
      Flavie&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;if any one here is capable of appreciating you it is
      certainly I. You seem to me a pearl dropped into the mire. You say you are
      forty-two, but a woman is no older than she looks, and many women of
      thirty would be thankful to have your figure and that noble countenance,
      where love has passed without ever filling the void in your heart. You
      have given yourself to God, I know, and I have too much religion myself to
      regret it, but I also know that you have done so because no human being
      has proved worthy of you. You have been loved, but you have never been
      adored&mdash;I have divined that. There is your husband, who has not known
      how to please you in a position in keeping with your deserts. He dislikes
      me, as if he thought I loved you; and he prevents me from telling you of a
      way that I think I have found to place you in the sphere for which you
      were destined. No, madame,&rdquo; he continued, rising, &ldquo;the Abbe Gondrin will
      not preach this year through Lent at our humble Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas;
      the preacher will be Monsieur d&rsquo;Estival, a compatriot of mine, and you
      will hear in him one of the most impressive speakers that I have ever
      known,&mdash;a priest whose outward appearance is not agreeable, but, oh!
      what a soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my desire will be gratified,&rdquo; said poor Madame Thuillier. &ldquo;I have
      never yet been able to understand a famous preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile flickered on the lips of Mademoiselle Thuillier and several others
      who heard the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They devote themselves too much to theological demonstration,&rdquo; said
      Theodose. &ldquo;I have long thought so myself&mdash;but I never talk religion;
      if it had not been for Madame <i>de</i> Colleville, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there demonstrations in theology?&rdquo; asked the professor of
      mathematics, naively, plunging headlong into the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Theodose, looking straight at Felix Phellion,
      &ldquo;that you cannot be serious in asking me such a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix,&rdquo; said old Phellion, coming heavily to the rescue of his son, and
      catching a distressed look on the pale face of Madame Thuillier,&mdash;&ldquo;Felix
      separates religion into two categories; he considers it from the human
      point of view and the divine point of view,&mdash;tradition and reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is heresy, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;Religion is one; it
      requires, above all things, faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Phellion, nonplussed by that remark, nodded to his wife:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is getting late, my dear,&rdquo; and he pointed to the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Monsieur Felix,&rdquo; said Celeste in a whisper to the candid
      mathematician, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you be, like Pascal and Bossuet, learned and
      pious both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Phellions, on departing, carried the Collevilles with them. Soon no
      one remained in the salon but Dutocq, Theodose, and the Thuilliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flattery administered by Theodose to Flavie seems at the first sight
      coarsely commonplace, but we must here remark, in the interests of this
      history, that the barrister was keeping himself as close as possible to
      these vulgar minds; he was navigating their waters; he spoke their
      language. His painter was Pierre Grassou, and not Joseph Bridau; his book
      was &ldquo;Paul and Virginia.&rdquo; The greatest living poet for him was Casimire de
      la Vigne; to his eyes the mission of art was, above all things, utility.
      Parmentier, the discoverer of the potato, was greater to him that thirty
      Raffaelles; the man in the blue cloak seemed to him a sister of charity.
      These were Thuillier&rsquo;s expressions, and Theodose remembered them all&mdash;on
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young Felix Phellion,&rdquo; he now remarked, &ldquo;is precisely the academical
      man of our day; the product of knowledge which sends God to the rear.
      Heavens, what are we coming to? Religion alone can save France; nothing
      but the fear of hell will preserve us from domestic robbery, which is
      going on at all hours in the bosom of families, and eating into the surest
      fortunes. All of you have a secret warfare in your homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this shrewd tirade, which made a great impression upon Brigitte, he
      retired, followed by Dutocq, after wishing good evening to the three
      Thuilliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man has great capacity,&rdquo; said Thuillier, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that he has,&rdquo; replied Brigitte, extinguishing the lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has religion,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier, as she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; Phellion was saying to Colleville as they came abreast of the
      Ecole de Mines, looking about him to see that no one was near, &ldquo;it is
      usually my custom to submit my insight to that of others, but it is
      impossible for me not to think that that young lawyer plays the master at
      our friend Thuillier&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own opinion,&rdquo; said Colleville, who was walking with Phellion behind
      his wife, Madame Phellion, and Celeste, &ldquo;is that he&rsquo;s a Jesuit; and I
      don&rsquo;t like Jesuits; the best of them are no good. To my mind a Jesuit
      means knavery, and knavery for knavery&rsquo;s sake; they deceive for the
      pleasure of deceiving, and, as the saying is, to keep their hand in.
      That&rsquo;s my opinion, and I don&rsquo;t mince it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, monsieur,&rdquo; said Phellion, who was arm-in-arm with
      Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur Phellion,&rdquo; remarked Flavie in a shrill voice, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      understand Colleville; but I know what he means, and I think he had better
      stop saying it. Such subjects are not to be talked of in the street, at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, and before a young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, wife,&rdquo; said Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the rue des Deux-Eglises, which Phellion was to take,
      they all stopped to say good-night, and Felix Phellion, who was bring up
      the rear, said to Colleville:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, your son Francois could enter the Ecole Polytechnique if he
      were well-coached; I propose to you to fit him to pass the examinations
      this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an offer not to be refused! Thank you, my friend,&rdquo; said
      Colleville. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Phellion to his son, as they walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad stroke!&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very cleverly paying court to Celeste&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I never find the solution of my problem if I even thought of it!&rdquo;
       cried the young professor. &ldquo;I discovered, when talking with the little
      Collevilles, that Francois has a strong turn for mathematics, and I
      thought I ought to enlighten his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, my son!&rdquo; repeated Phellion. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you otherwise. My
      prayers are granted! I have a son whose honor, probity, and private and
      civic virtues are all that I could wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Colleville, as soon as Celeste had gone to bed, said to her
      husband:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colleville, don&rsquo;t utter those blunt opinions about people without knowing
      something about them. When you talk of Jesuits I know you mean priests;
      and I wish you would do me the kindness to keep your opinions on religion
      to yourself when you are in company with your daughter. We may sacrifice
      our own souls, but not the souls of our children. You don&rsquo;t want Celeste
      to be a creature without religion? And remember, my dear, that we are at
      the mercy of others; we have four children to provide for; and how do you
      know that, some day or other, you may not need the services of this one or
      that one? Therefore don&rsquo;t make enemies. You haven&rsquo;t any now, for you are a
      good-natured fellow; and, thanks to that quality, which amounts in you to
      a charm, we have got along pretty well in life, so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said Colleville, flinging his coat on a chair and pulling
      off his cravat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong, and you are right, my beautiful Flavie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on the next occasion, my dear old sheep,&rdquo; said the sly creature,
      tapping her husband&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;you must try to be polite to that young
      lawyer; he is a schemer and we had better have him on our side. He is
      playing comedy&mdash;well! play comedy with him; be his dupe apparently;
      if he proves to have talent, if he has a future before him, make a friend
      of him. Do you think I want to see you forever in the mayor&rsquo;s office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, wife Colleville,&rdquo; said the former clarionet, tapping his knee to
      indicate the place he wished his wife to take. &ldquo;Let us warm our toes and
      talk.&mdash;When I look at you I am more than ever convinced that the
      youth of women is in their figure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in their heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, both,&rdquo; assented Colleville; &ldquo;waist slender, heart solid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you old stupid, deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is good about you is that you have kept your fairness without
      growing fat. But the fact is, you have such tiny bones. Flavie, it is a
      fact that if I had life to live over again I shouldn&rsquo;t wish for any other
      wife than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well I have always preferred you to <i>others</i>. How
      unlucky that monseigneur is dead! Do you know what I covet for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some office at the Hotel de Ville,&mdash;an office worth twelve thousand
      francs a year; cashier, or something of that kind; either there, or at
      Poissy, in the municipal department; or else as manufacturer of musical
      instruments&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one of them would suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! if that queer barrister has power, and he certainly has
      plenty of intrigue, let us manage him. I&rsquo;ll sound him; leave me to do the
      thing&mdash;and, above all, don&rsquo;t thwart his game at the Thuilliers&rsquo;.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Theodose had laid a finger on a sore sport in Flavie Colleville&rsquo;s heart;
      and this requires an explanation, which may, perhaps, have the value of a
      synthetic glance at women&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At forty years of age a woman, above all, if she has tasted the poisoned
      apple of passion, undergoes a solemn shock; she sees two deaths before
      her: that of the body and that of the heart. Dividing women into two great
      categories which respond to the common ideas, and calling them either
      virtuous or guilty, it is allowable to say that after that fatal period
      they both suffer pangs of terrible intensity. If virtuous, and
      disappointed in the deepest hopes of their nature&mdash;whether they have
      had the courage to submit, whether they have buried their revolt in their
      hearts or at the foot of the altar&mdash;they never admit to themselves
      that all is over for them without horror. That thought has such strange
      and diabolical depths that in it lies the reason of some of those
      apostasies which have, at times, amazed the world and horrified it. If
      guilty, women of that age fall into one of several delirious conditions
      which often turn, alas! to madness, or end in suicide, or terminate in
      some with passion greater than the situation itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the &ldquo;dilemmatic&rdquo; meaning of this crisis. Either they have
      known happiness, known it in a virtuous life, and are unable to breathe in
      any air but that surcharged with incense, or act in any but a balmy
      atmosphere of flattery and worship,&mdash;if so, how is it possible to
      renounce it?&mdash;or, by a phenomenon less rare than singular, they have
      found only wearying pleasures while seeking for the happiness that escaped
      them&mdash;sustained in that eager chase by the irritating satisfactions
      of vanity, clinging to the game like a gambler to his double or quits; for
      to them these last days of beauty are their last stake against despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been loved, but never adored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That speech of Theodose, accompanied by a look which read, not into her
      heart, but into her life, was the key-note to her enigma, and Flavie felt
      herself divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer had merely repeated ideas which literature has rendered
      trivial; but what matter where the whip comes from, or how it is made, if
      it touches the sensitive spot of a horse&rsquo;s hide? The emotion was in
      Flavie, not in the speech, just as the noise is not in the avalanche,
      though it produces it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young officer, two fops, a banker, a clumsy youth, and Colleville, were
      poor attempts at happiness. Once in her life Madame Colleville had dreamed
      of it, but never attained it. Death had hastened to put an end to the only
      passion in which she had found a charm. For the last two years she had
      listened to the voice of religion, which told her that neither the Church,
      nor its votaries, should talk of love or happiness, but of duty and
      resignation; that the only happiness lay in the satisfaction of fulfilling
      painful and costly duties, the rewards for which were not in this world.
      All the same, however, she was conscious of another clamoring voice; but,
      inasmuch as her religion was only a mask which it suited her to wear, and
      not a conversion, she did not lay it aside, thinking it a resource.
      Believing also that piety, false or true, was a becoming manner in which
      to meet her future, she continued in the Church, as though it were the
      cross-roads of a forest, where, seated on a bench, she read the
      sign-posts, and waited for some lucky chance; feeling all the while that
      night was coming on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that her interest was keenly excited when Theodose put
      her secret condition of mind into words, seeming to promise her the
      realization of her castle in the air, already built and overthrown some
      six or eight times.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning of the winter she had noticed that Theodose was
      examining and studying her, though cautiously and secretly. More than
      once, she had put on her gray moire silk with its black lace, and her
      headdress of Mechlin with a few flowers, in order to appear to her best
      advantage; and men know very well when a toilet has been made to please
      them. The old beau of the Empire, that handsome Thuillier, overwhelmed her
      with compliments, assuring her she was queen of the salon, but la Peyrade
      said infinitely more to the purpose by a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavie had expected, Sunday after Sunday, a declaration, saying to herself
      at times:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows I am ruined and haven&rsquo;t a sou. Perhaps he is really pious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose did nothing rashly; like a wise musician, he had marked the place
      in his symphony where he intended to tap his drum. When he saw Colleville
      attempting to warn Thuillier against him, he fired his broadside, cleverly
      prepared during the three or four months in which he had been studying
      Flavie; he now succeeded with her as he had, earlier in the day, succeeded
      with Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      While getting into bed, Theodose said to himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife is on my side; the husband can&rsquo;t endure me; they are now
      quarrelling; and I shall get the better of it, for she does what she likes
      with that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was mistaken in one thing: there was no dispute whatever, and
      Colleville was sleeping peacefully beside his dear little Flavie, while
      she was saying to herself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly Theodose must be a superior man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many men, like la Peyrade, derive their superiority from the audacity, or
      the difficulty, of an enterprise; the strength they display increases
      their muscular power, and they spend it freely. Then when success is won,
      or defeat is met, the public is astonished to find how small, exhausted,
      and puny those men really are. After casting into the minds of the two
      persons on whom Celeste&rsquo;s fate chiefly depended, an interest and curiosity
      that were almost feverish, Theodose pretended to be a very busy man; for
      five or six days he was out of the house from morning till night, in order
      not to meet Flavie until the time when her interest should increase to the
      point of overstepping conventionality, and also in order to force the
      handsome Thuillier to come and fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Sunday he felt certain he should find Madame Colleville at
      church; he was not mistaken, for they came out, each of them, at the same
      moment, and met at the corner of the rue des Deux-Eglises. Theodose
      offered his arm, which Flavie accepted, leaving her daughter to walk in
      front with her brother Anatole. This youngest child, then about twelve
      years old, being destined for the seminary, was now at the Barniol
      institute, where he obtained an elementary education; Barniol, the
      son-in-law of the Phellions, was naturally making the tuition fees light,
      with a view to the hoped-for alliance between Felix and Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done me the honor and favor of thinking over what I said to you
      so badly the other day?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, in a caressing tone, pressing
      the lady&rsquo;s arm to his heart with a movement both soft and strong; for he
      seemed to wish to restrain himself and appear respectful, in spite of his
      evident eagerness. &ldquo;Do not misunderstand my intentions,&rdquo; he continued,
      after receiving from Madame Colleville one of those looks which women
      trained to the management of passion know how to give,&mdash;a look that,
      by mere expression, can convey both severe rebuke and secret community of
      sentiment. &ldquo;I love you as we love a noble nature struggling against
      misfortune; Christian charity enfolds both the strong and the weak; its
      treasure belongs to both. Refined, graceful, elegant as you are, made to
      be an ornament of the highest society, what man could see you without
      feeling an immense compassion in his heart&mdash;buried here among these
      odious bourgeois, who know nothing of you, not even the aristocratic value
      of a single one of your attitudes, or those enchanting inflections of your
      voice! Ah! if I were only rich! if I had power! your husband, who is
      certainly a good fellow, should be made receiver-general, and you yourself
      could get him elected deputy. But, alas! poor ambitious man, my first duty
      is to silence my ambition. Knowing myself at the bottom of the bag like
      the last number in a family lottery, I can only offer you my arm and not
      my heart. I hope all from a good marriage, and, believe me, I shall make
      my wife not only happy, but I shall make her one of the first in the land,
      receiving from her the means of success. It is so fine a day, will you not
      take a turn in the Luxembourg?&rdquo; he added, as they reached the rue d&rsquo;Enfer
      at the corner of Colleville&rsquo;s house, opposite to which was a passage
      leading to the gardens by the stairway of a little building, the last
      remains of the famous convent of the Chartreux.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft yielding of the arm within his own, indicated a tacit consent to
      this proposal, and as Flavie deserved the honor of a sort of enthusiasm,
      he drew her vehemently along, exclaiming:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! we may never have so good a moment&mdash;But see!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there
      is your husband at the window looking at us; let us walk slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing to fear from Monsieur Colleville,&rdquo; said Flavie, smiling;
      &ldquo;he leaves me mistress of my own actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here, indeed, is the woman I have dreamed of,&rdquo; cried the Provencal,
      with that ecstasy that inflames the soul only, and in tones that issue
      only from Southern lips. &ldquo;Pardon me, madame,&rdquo; he said, recovering himself,
      and returning from an upper sphere to the exiled angel whom he looked at
      piously,&mdash;&ldquo;pardon me, I abandon what I was saying; but how can a man
      help feeling for the sorrows he has known himself when he sees them the
      lot of a being to whom life should bring only joy and happiness? Your
      sufferings are mine; I am no more in my right place than you are in yours;
      the same misfortune has made us brother and sister. Ah! dear Flavie, the
      first day it was granted to me to see you&mdash;the last Sunday in
      September, 1838&mdash;you were very beautiful; I shall often recall you to
      memory in that pretty little gown of mousseline-de-laine of the color of
      some Scottish tartan! That day I said to myself: &lsquo;Why is that woman so
      often at the Thuilliers&rsquo;; above all, why did she ever have intimate
      relations with Thuillier himself?&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said Flavie, alarmed at the singular course la Peyrade was
      giving to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! I know all,&rdquo; he cried, accompanying the words with a shrug of his
      shoulders. &ldquo;I explain it all to my own mind, and I do not respect you
      less. You now have to gather the fruits of your sin, and I will help you.
      Celeste will be very rich, and in that lies your own future. You can have
      only one son-in-law; chose him wisely. An ambitious man might become a
      minister, but you would humble your daughter and make her miserable; and
      if such a man lost his place and fortune he could never recover it. Yes, I
      love you,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I love you with an unlimited affection; you are
      far above the mass of petty considerations in which silly women entangle
      themselves. Let us understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flavie was bewildered; she was, however, awake to the extreme frankness of
      such language, and she said to herself, &ldquo;He is not a secret manoeuvrer,
      certainly.&rdquo; Moreover, she admitted to her own mind that no one had ever so
      deeply stirred and excited her as this young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not know who could have put into your mind so
      great an error as to my life, nor by what right you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! pardon me, madame,&rdquo; interrupted the Provencal with a coolness that
      smacked of contempt. &ldquo;I must have dreamed it. I said to myself, &lsquo;She is
      all that!&rsquo; But I see I was judging from the outside. I know now why you
      are living and will always live on a fourth floor in the rue d&rsquo;Enfer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed his speech with an energetic gesture toward the Colleville
      windows, which could be seen through the passage from the alley of the
      Luxembourg, where they were walking alone, in that immense tract trodden
      by so many and various young ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been frank, and I expected reciprocity,&rdquo; resumed Theodose. &ldquo;I
      myself have had days without food, madame; I have managed to live, pursue
      my studies, obtain my degree, with two thousand francs for my sole
      dependence; and I entered Paris through the Barriere d&rsquo;Italie, with five
      hundred francs in my pocket, firmly resolved, like one of my compatriots,
      to become, some day, one of the foremost men of our country. The man who
      has often picked his food from baskets of scraps where the restaurateurs
      put their refuse, which are emptied at six o&rsquo;clock every morning&mdash;that
      man is not likely to recoil before any means,&mdash;avowable, of course.
      Well, do you think me the friend of the people?&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;One
      has to have a speaking-trumpet to reach the ear of Fame; she doesn&rsquo;t
      listen if you speak with your lips; and without fame of what use is
      talent? The poor man&rsquo;s advocate means to be some day the advocate of the
      rich. Is that plain speaking? Don&rsquo;t I open my inmost being to you? Then
      open your heart to me. Say to me, &lsquo;Let us be friends,&rsquo; and the day will
      come when we shall both be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! why did I ever come here? Why did I ever take your arm?&rdquo;
       cried Flavie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is in your destiny,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Ah! my dear, beloved
      Flavie,&rdquo; he added, again pressing her arm upon his heart, &ldquo;did you expect
      to hear the vulgarities of love from me? We are brother and sister; that
      is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led her towards the passage to return to the rue d&rsquo;Enfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavie felt a sort of terror in the depths of the contentment which all
      women find in violent emotions; and she took that terror for the sort of
      fear which a new passion always excites; but for all that, she felt she
      was fascinated, and she walked along in absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; asked Theodose, when they reached the middle
      of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what you have just said to me,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At our age,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is best to suppress preliminaries; we are not
      children; we both belong to a sphere in which we should understand each
      other. Remember this,&rdquo; he added, as they reached the rue d&rsquo;Enfer.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am wholly yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he bowed low to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The iron&rsquo;s in the fire now!&rdquo; he thought to himself as he watched his
      giddy prey on her way home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A KEYNOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Theodose reached home he found, waiting for him on the landing, a
      personage who is, as it were, the submarine current of this history; he
      will be found within it like some buried church on which has risen the
      facade of a palace. The sight of this man, who, after vainly ringing at la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s door, was now trying that of Dutocq, made the Provencal
      barrister tremble&mdash;but secretly, within himself, not betraying
      externally his inward emotion. This man was Cerizet, whom Dutocq had
      mentioned to Thuillier as his copying-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet was only thirty-eight years old, but he looked a man of fifty, so
      aged had he become from causes which age all men. His hairless head had a
      yellow skull, ill-covered by a rusty, discolored wig; the mask of his
      face, pale, flabby, and unnaturally rough, seemed the more horrible
      because the nose was eaten away, though not sufficiently to admit of its
      being replaced by a false one. From the spring of this nose at the
      forehead, down to the nostrils, it remained as nature had made it; but
      disease, after gnawing away the sides near the extremities, had left two
      holes of fantastic shape, which vitiated pronunciation and hampered
      speech. The eyes, originally handsome, but weakened by misery of all kinds
      and by sleepless nights, were red around the edges, and deeply sunken; the
      glance of those eyes, when the soul sent into them an expression of
      malignancy, would have frightened both judges and criminals, or any others
      whom nothing usually affrights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouth, toothless except for a few black fangs, was threatening; the
      saliva made a foam within it, which did not, however, pass the pale thin
      lips. Cerizet, a short man, less spare than shrunken, endeavored to remedy
      the defects of his person by his clothes, and although his garments were
      not those of opulence, he kept them in a condition of neatness which may
      even have increased his forlorn appearance. Everything about him seemed
      dubious; his age, his nose, his glance inspired doubt. It was impossible
      to know if he were thirty-eight or sixty; if his faded blue trousers,
      which fitted him well, were of a coming or a past fashion. His boots, worn
      at the heels, but scrupulously blacked, resoled for the third time, and
      very choice, originally, may have trodden in their day a ministerial
      carpet. The frock coat, soaked by many a down-pour, with its brandebourgs,
      the frogs of which were indiscreet enough to show their skeletons,
      testified by its cut to departed elegance. The satin stock-cravat
      fortunately concealed the shirt, but the tongue of the buckle behind the
      neck had frayed the satin, which was re-satined, that is, re-polished, by
      a species of oil distilled from the wig. In the days of its youth the
      waistcoat was not, of course, without freshness, but it was one of those
      waistcoats, bought for four francs, which come from the hooks of the
      ready-made clothing dealer. All these things were carefully brushed, and
      so was the shiny and misshapen hat. They harmonized with each other, even
      to the black gloves which covered the hands of this subaltern
      Mephistopheles, whose whole anterior life may be summed up in a single
      phrase:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an artist in evil, with whom, from the first, evil had succeeded; a
      man misled by these early successes to continue the plotting of infamous
      deeds within the lines of strict legality. Becoming the head of a
      printing-office by betraying his master [see &ldquo;Lost Illusions&rdquo;], he had
      afterwards been condemned to imprisonment as editor of a liberal
      newspaper. In the provinces, under the Restoration, he became the bete
      noire of the government, and was called &ldquo;that unfortunate Cerizet&rdquo; by
      some, as people spoke of &ldquo;the unfortunate Chauvet&rdquo; and &ldquo;the heroic
      Mercier.&rdquo; He owed to this reputation of persecuted patriotism a place as
      sub-prefect in 1830. Six months later he was dismissed; but he insisted
      that he was judged without being heard; and he made so much talk about it
      that, under the ministry of Casimir Perier, he became the editor of an
      anti-republican newspaper in the pay of the government. He left that
      position to go into business, one phase of which was the most nefarious
      stock-company that ever fell into the hands of the correctional police.
      Cerizet proudly accepted the severe sentence he received; declaring it to
      be a revengeful plot on the part of the republicans, who, he said, would
      never forgive him for the hard blows he had dealt them in his journal. He
      spent the time of his imprisonment in a hospital. The government by this
      time were ashamed of a man whose almost infamous habits and shameful
      business transactions, carried on in company with a former banker, named
      Claparon, led him at last into well-deserved public contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet, thus fallen, step by step, to the lowest rung of the social
      ladder, had recourse to pity in order to obtain the place of copying clerk
      in Dutocq&rsquo;s office. In the depths of his wretchedness the man still
      dreamed of revenge, and, as he had nothing to lose, he employed all means
      to that end. Dutocq and himself were bound together in depravity. Cerizet
      was to Dutocq what the hound is the huntsman. Knowing himself the
      necessities of poverty and wretchedness, he set up that business of gutter
      usury called, in popular parlance, &ldquo;the loan by the little week.&rdquo; He began
      this at first by help of Dutocq, who shared the profits; but, at the
      present moment this man of many legal crimes, now the banker of fishwives,
      the money-lender of costermongers, was the gnawing rodent of the whole
      faubourg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet as Dutocq opened his door, &ldquo;Theodose has just come
      in; let us go to his room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advocate of the poor was fain to allow the two men to pass before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three crossed a little room, the tiled floor of which, covered with a
      coating of red encaustic, shone in the light; thence into a little salon
      with crimson curtains and mahogany furniture, covered with red Utrecht
      velvet; the wall opposite the window being occupied by book-shelves
      containing a legal library. The chimney-piece was covered with vulgar
      ornaments, a clock with four columns in mahogany, and candelabra under
      glass shades. The study, where the three men seated themselves before a
      soft-coal fire, was the study of a lawyer just beginning to practise. The
      furniture consisted of a desk, an armchair, little curtains of green silk
      at the windows, a green carpet, shelves for lawyer&rsquo;s boxes, and a couch,
      above which hung an ivory Christ on a velvet background. The bedroom,
      kitchen, and rest of the apartment looked out upon the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;how are things going? Are we getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit,&rdquo; cried Dutocq, &ldquo;that my idea was a famous one, in laying
      hold of that imbecile of a Thuillier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m not behindhand either,&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet. &ldquo;I have come now
      to show you a way to put the thumbscrews on the old maid and make her spin
      like a teetotum. We mustn&rsquo;t deceive ourselves; Mademoiselle Thuillier is
      the head and front of everything in this affair; if we get her on our side
      the town is won. Let us say little, but that little to the point, as
      becomes strong men with each other. Claparon, you know, is a fool; he&rsquo;ll
      be all his life what he always was,&mdash;a cat&rsquo;s-paw. Just now he is
      lending his name to a notary in Paris, who is concerned with a lot of
      contractors, and they are all&mdash;notary and masons&mdash;on the point
      of ruin. Claparon is going headlong into it. He never yet was bankrupt;
      but there&rsquo;s a first time for everything. He is hidden now in my hovel in
      the rue des Poules, where no one will ever find him. He is desperate, and
      he hasn&rsquo;t a penny. Now, among the five or six houses built by these
      contractors, which have to be sold, there&rsquo;s a jewel of a house, built of
      freestone, in the neighborhood of the Madeleine,&mdash;a frontage laced
      like a melon, with beautiful carvings,&mdash;but not being finished, it
      will have to be sold for what it will bring; certainly not more than a
      hundred thousand francs. By spending twenty-five thousand francs upon it
      it could be let, undoubtedly, for ten thousand. Make Mademoiselle
      Thuillier the proprietor of that house and you&rsquo;ll win her love; she&rsquo;ll
      believe that you can put such chances in her way every year. There are two
      ways of getting hold of vain people: flatter their vanity, <i>or</i>
      threaten them; and there are also two ways of managing misers: fill their
      purse, or else attack it. Now, this stroke of business, while it does good
      to Mademoiselle Thuillier, does good to us as well, and it would be a pity
      not to profit by the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why does the notary let it slip through his fingers?&rdquo; asked Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notary, my dear fellow! Why, he&rsquo;s the very one who saves us. Forced
      to sell his practice, and utterly ruined besides, he reserved for himself
      this crumb of the cake. Believing in the honesty of that idiot Claparon,
      he has asked him to find a dummy purchaser. We&rsquo;ll let him suppose that
      Mademoiselle Thuillier is a worthy soul who allows Claparon to use her
      name; they&rsquo;ll both be fooled, Claparon and the notary too. I owe this
      little trick to my friend Claparon, who left me to bear the whole weight
      of the trouble about his stock-company, in which we were tricked by
      Conture, and I hope you may never be in that man&rsquo;s skin!&rdquo; he added,
      infernal hatred flashing from his worn and withered eyes. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ve said
      my say, gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, sending out his voice through his nasal
      holes, and taking a dramatic attitude; for once, at a moment of extreme
      penury, he had gone upon the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he finished making his proposition some one rang at the outer door, and
      la Peyrade rose to go and open it. As soon as his back was turned, Cerizet
      said, hastily, to Dutocq:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of him? I see a sort of air about him&mdash;And I&rsquo;m a good
      judge of treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so completely in our power,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t trouble
      myself to watch; but, between ourselves, I didn&rsquo;t think him as strong as
      he proves to be. The fact is, we thought we were putting a barb between
      the legs of a man who didn&rsquo;t know how to ride, and the rogue is an old
      jockey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him take care,&rdquo; growled Cerizet. &ldquo;I can blow him down like a house of
      cards any day. As for you, papa Dutocq, you are able to see him at work
      all the time; watch him carefully. Besides, I&rsquo;ll feel his pulse by getting
      Claparon to propose to him to get rid of us; that will help us to judge
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good, that!&rdquo; said Dutocq. &ldquo;You are daring, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my hand in, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were exchanged in a low voice during the time that it took
      Theodose to go to the outer door and return. Cerizet was looking at the
      books when the lawyer re-entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Thuillier,&rdquo; said Theodose. &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d come; he is in the
      salon. He mustn&rsquo;t see Cerizet&rsquo;s frock-coat; those frogs would frighten
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! you receive the poor in your office, don&rsquo;t you? That&rsquo;s in your
      role. Do you want any money?&rdquo; added Cerizet, pulling a hundred francs out
      of his trousers&rsquo; pocket. &ldquo;There it is; it won&rsquo;t look amiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he laid the pile on the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;we had better get out through the bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; said Theodose, opening a hidden door which communicated
      from the study to the bedroom. &ldquo;Come in, Monsieur Thuillier,&rdquo; he called
      out to the beau of the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw him safely in the study he went to let out his two associates
      through the bedroom and kitchen into the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In six months,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have married Celeste and got your
      foot into the stirrup. You are lucky, you are, not to have sat, like me,
      in the prisoners&rsquo; dock. I&rsquo;ve been there twice: once in 1825, for
      &lsquo;subversive articles&rsquo; which I never wrote, and the second time for
      receiving the profits of a joint-stock company which had slipped through
      my fingers! Come, let&rsquo;s warm this thing up! Sac-a-papier! Dutocq and I are
      sorely in need of that twenty-five thousand francs. Good courage, old
      fellow!&rdquo; he added, holding out his hand to Theodose, and making the grasp
      a test of faithfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Provencal gave Cerizet his right hand, pressing the other&rsquo;s hand
      warmly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be very sure that in whatever position I may
      find myself I shall never forget that from which you have drawn me by
      putting me in the saddle here. I&rsquo;m simply your bait; but you are giving me
      the best part of the catch, and I should be more infamous than a
      galley-slave who turns policeman if I didn&rsquo;t play fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the door was closed, Cerizet peeped through the key-hole,
      trying to catch sight of la Peyrade&rsquo;s face. But the Provencal had turned
      back to meet Thuillier, and his distrustful associate could not detect the
      expression of his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That expression was neither disgust nor annoyance, it was simply joy,
      appearing on a face that now seemed freed. Theodose saw the means of
      success approaching him, and he flattered himself that the day would come
      when he might get rid of his ignoble associates, to whom he owed
      everything. Poverty has unfathomable depths, especially in Paris, slimy
      bottoms, from which, when a drowned man rises to the surface of the water,
      he brings with him filth and impurity clinging to his clothes, or to his
      person. Cerizet, the once opulent friend and protector of Theodose, was
      the muddy mire still clinging to the Provencal, and the former manager of
      the joint-stock company saw very plainly that his tool wanted to brush
      himself on entering a sphere where decent clothing was a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Theodose,&rdquo; began Thuillier, &ldquo;we have hoped to see you every
      day this week, and every evening we find our hopes deceived. As this is
      our Sunday for a dinner, my sister and my wife have sent me here to beg
      you to come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so busy,&rdquo; said Theodose, &ldquo;that I have not had two minutes to
      give to any one, not even to you, whom I count among my friends, and with
      whom I have wished to talk about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? have you really been thinking seriously over what you said to me?&rdquo;
       cried Thuillier, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not come here now for a full understanding, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      respect you as I do,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, smiling. &ldquo;You have been a
      sub-director, and therefore you must have the remains of ambition&mdash;which
      is deucedly legitimate in your case! Come, now, between ourselves, when
      one sees a Minard, that gilded pot, displaying himself at the Tuileries,
      and complimenting the king, and a Popinot about to become a minister of
      State, and then look at you! a man trained to administrative work, a man
      with thirty years&rsquo; experience, who has seen six governments, left to plant
      balsams in a little garden! Heavens and earth!&mdash;I am frank, my dear
      Thuillier, and I&rsquo;ll say, honestly, that I want to advance you, because
      you&rsquo;ll draw me after you. Well, here&rsquo;s my plan. We are soon to elect a
      member of the council-general from this arrondissement; and that member
      must be you. And,&rdquo; he added, dwelling on the word, &ldquo;it <i>will</i> be you!
      After that, you will certainly be deputy from the arrondissement when the
      Chamber is re-elected, which must surely be before long. The votes that
      elect you to the municipal council will stand by you in the election for
      deputy, trust me for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how will you manage all this?&rdquo; cried Thuillier, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know in good time; but you must let me conduct this long and
      difficult affair; if you commit the slightest indiscretion as to what is
      said, or planned, or agreed between us, I shall have to drop the whole
      matter, and good-bye to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you can rely on the absolute dumbness of a former sub-director; I&rsquo;ve
      had secrets to keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well; but these are secrets to keep from your wife and
      sister, and from Monsieur and Madame Colleville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a muscle of my face shall reveal them,&rdquo; said Thuillier, assuming a
      stolid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; continued Theodose. &ldquo;I shall test you. In order to make
      yourself eligible, you must pay taxes on a certain amount of property, and
      you are not paying them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I&rsquo;m all right for the municipal council at any rate; I
      pay two francs ninety-six centimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the tax on property necessary for election to the chamber is
      five hundred francs, and there is no time to lose in acquiring that
      property, because you must prove possession for one year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Thuillier; &ldquo;between now and a year hence to be taxed
      five hundred francs on property which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between now and the end of July, at the latest, you must pay that tax.
      Well, I feel enough interest in you to tell you the secret of an affair by
      which you might make from thirty to forty thousand francs a year, by
      employing a capital of one hundred and fifty thousand at most. I know that
      in your family it is your sister who does your business; I am far from
      thinking that a mistake; she has, they tell me, excellent judgment; and
      you must let me begin by obtaining her good-will and friendship, and
      proposing this investment to her. And this is why: If Mademoiselle
      Thuillier is not induced to put faith in my plan, we shall certainly have
      difficulty with her. Besides, it won&rsquo;t do for YOU to propose to her that
      she should put the investment of her money in your name. The idea had
      better come from me. As to my means of getting you elected to the
      municipal council, they are these: Phellion controls one quarter of the
      arrondissement; he and Laudigeois have lived in it these thirty years, and
      they are listened to like oracles. I have a friend who controls another
      quarter; and the rector of Saint-Jacques, who is not without influence,
      thanks to his virtues, disposes of certain votes. Dutocq, in his close
      relation to the people, and also the justice of peace, will help me, above
      all, as I&rsquo;m not acting for myself; and Colleville, as secretary of the
      mayor&rsquo;s office, can certainly manage to obtain another fourth of the
      votes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; cried Thuillier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m elected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, in a voice of the deepest sarcasm.
      &ldquo;Very good! then go and ask your friend Colleville to help you, and see
      what he&rsquo;ll say. No triumph in election cases is ever brought about by the
      candidate himself, but by his friends. He should never ask anything
      himself for himself; he must be invited to accept, and appear to be
      without ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Peyrade!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, rising, and taking the hand of the young
      lawyer, &ldquo;you are a very capable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as capable as you, but I have my merits,&rdquo; said the Provencal,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we succeed how shall I ever repay you?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that, indeed! I am afraid you will think me impertinent, but
      remember, there is a true feeling in my heart which offers some excuse for
      me; in fact, it has given me the spirit to undertake this affair. I love&mdash;and
      I take you for my confidant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is it?&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dear little Celeste,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade. &ldquo;My love for her will be a
      pledge to you of my devotion. What would I not do for a <i>father-in-law</i>!
      This is pure selfishness; I shall be working for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, my friend!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, catching Thuillier round the body; &ldquo;if I
      hadn&rsquo;t Flavie on my side, and if I didn&rsquo;t know <i>all</i> should I venture
      to be talking to you thus? But please say nothing to Flavie about this;
      wait till she speaks to you. Listen to me; I&rsquo;m of the metal that makes
      ministers; I do not seek to obtain Celeste until I deserve her. You shall
      not be asked to give her to me until the day when your election as a
      deputy of Paris is assured. In order to be deputy of Paris, we must get
      the better of Minard; and in order to crush Minard you must keep in your
      own hands all your means of influence; for that reason use Celeste as a
      hope; we&rsquo;ll play them off, these people, against each other and fool them
      all&mdash;Madame Colleville and you and I will be persons of importance
      one of these days. Don&rsquo;t think me mercenary. I want Celeste without a
      &lsquo;dot,&rsquo; with nothing more than her future expectations. To live in your
      family with you, to keep my wife in your midst, that is my desire. You see
      now that I have no hidden thoughts. As for you, my dear friend, six months
      after your election to the municipal council, you will have the cross of
      the Legion of honor, and when you are deputy you will be made an officer
      of it. As for your speeches in the Chamber&mdash;well! we&rsquo;ll write them
      together. Perhaps it would be desirable for you to write a book,&mdash;a
      serious book on matters half moral and philanthropic, half political;
      such, for instance, as charitable institutions considered from the highest
      stand-point; or reforms in the pawning system, the abuses of which are
      really frightful. Let us fasten some slight distinction to your name; it
      will help you,&mdash;especially in the arrondissement. Now, I say again,
      trust me, believe in me; do not think of taking me into your family until
      you have the ribbon in your buttonhole on the morrow of the day when you
      take your seat in the Chamber. I&rsquo;ll do more than that, however; I&rsquo;ll put
      you in the way of making forty thousand francs a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For any one of those three things you shall have our Celeste,&rdquo; said
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what a pearl she is!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade, raising his eyes to
      heaven. &ldquo;I have the weakness to pray to God for her every day. She is
      charming; she is exactly like you&mdash;oh! nonsense; surely you needn&rsquo;t
      caution me! Dutocq told me all. Well, I&rsquo;ll be with you to-night. I must go
      to the Phellions&rsquo; now, and begin to work our plan. You don&rsquo;t need me to
      caution you not to let it be known that you are thinking of me for
      Celeste; if you do, you&rsquo;ll cut off my arms and legs. Therefore, silence!
      even to Flavie. Wait till she speaks to you herself. Phellion shall
      to-night broach the matter of proposing you as candidate for the council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-night,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;unless I don&rsquo;t find him at home
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier departed, saying to himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very superior man; we shall always understand each other. Faith!
      it might be hard to do better for Celeste. They will live with us, as in
      our own family, and that&rsquo;s a good deal! Yes, he&rsquo;s a fine fellow, a sound
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To minds of Thuillier&rsquo;s calibre, a secondary consideration often assumes
      the importance of a principal reason. Theodose had behaved to him with
      charming bonhomie.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE WORTHY PHELLIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The house to which Theodose de la Peyrade now bent his steps had been the
      &ldquo;hoc erat in votis&rdquo; of Monsieur Phellion for twenty years; it was the
      house of the Phellions, just as much as Cerizet&rsquo;s frogged coat was the
      necessary complement of his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dwelling was stuck against the side of a large house, but only to the
      depth of one room (about twenty feet or so), and terminated at each end in
      a sort of pavilion with one window. Its chief charm was a garden, one
      hundred and eighty feet square, longer than the facade of the house by the
      width of a courtyard which opened on the street, and a little clump of
      lindens. Beyond the second pavilion, the courtyard had, between itself and
      the street, an iron railing, in the centre of which was a little gate
      opening in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This building, of rouge stone covered with stucco, and two storeys in
      height, had received a coat of yellow-wash; the blinds were painted green,
      and so were the shutters on the lower storey. The kitchen occupied the
      ground-floor of the pavilion on the courtyard, and the cook, a stout,
      strong girl, protected by two enormous dogs, performed the functions of
      portress. The facade, composed of five windows, and the two pavilions,
      which projected nine feet, were in the style Phellion. Above the door the
      master of the house had inserted a tablet of white marble, on which, in
      letters of gold, were read the words, &ldquo;Aurea mediocritas.&rdquo; Above the
      sun-dial, affixed to one panel of the facade, he had also caused to be
      inscribed this sapient maxim: &ldquo;Umbra mea vita, sic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The former window-sills had recently been superceded by sills of red
      Languedoc marble, found in a marble shop. At the bottom of the garden
      could be seen a colored statue, intended to lead casual observers to
      imagine that a nurse was carrying a child. The ground-floor of the house
      contained only the salon and the dining-room, separated from each other by
      the well of the staircase and the landing, which formed a sort of
      antechamber. At the end of the salon, in the other pavilion, was a little
      study occupied by Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first upper floor were the rooms of the father and mother and that
      of the young professor. Above were the chambers of the children and the
      servants; for Phellion, on consideration of his own age and that of his
      wife, had set up a male domestic, aged fifteen, his son having by that
      time entered upon his duties of tuition. To right, on entering the
      courtyard, were little offices where wood was stored, and where the former
      proprietor had lodged a porter. The Phellions were no doubt awaiting the
      marriage of their son to allow themselves that additional luxury.

      This property, on which the Phellions had long had their eye, cost them
      eighteen thousand francs in 1831. The house was separated from the
      courtyard by a balustrade with a base of freestone and a coping of tiles;
      this little wall, which was breast-high, was lined with a hedge of Bengal
      roses, in the middle of which opened a wooden gate opposite and leading to
      the large gates on the street. Those who know the cul-de-sac of the
      Feuillantines, will understand that the Phellion house, standing at right
      angles to the street, had a southern exposure, and was protected on the
      north by the immense wall of the adjoining house, against which the
      smaller structure was built. The cupola of the Pantheon and that of the
      Val-de-Grace looked from there like two giants, and so diminished the sky
      space that, walking in the garden, one felt cramped and oppressed. No
      place could be more silent than this blind street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the retreat of the great unknown citizen who was now tasting the
      sweets of repose, after discharging his duty to the nation in the ministry
      of finance, from which he had retired as registration clerk after a
      service of thirty-six years. In 1832 he had led his battalion of the
      National Guard to the attack on Saint-Merri, but his neighbors had
      previously seen tears in his eyes at the thought of being obliged to fire
      on misguided Frenchmen. The affair was already decided by the time his
      legion crossed the pont Notre-Dame at a quick step, after debouching by
      the flower-market. This noble hesitation won him the respect of his whole
      quarter, but he lost the decoration of the Legion of honor; his colonel
      told him in a loud voice that, under arms, there was no such thing as
      deliberation,&mdash;a saying of Louis-Philippe to the National Guard of
      Metz. Nevertheless, the bourgeois virtues of Phellion, and the great
      respect in which he was held in his own quarter had kept him major of the
      battalion for eight years. He was now nearly sixty, and seeing the moment
      coming when he must lay off the sword and stock, he hoped that the king
      would deign to reward his services by granting him at last the Legion of
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth compels us to say, in spite of the stain this pettiness will put
      upon so fine a character, that Commander Phellion rose upon the tips of
      his toes at the receptions in the Tuileries, and did all that he could to
      put himself forward, even eyeing the citizen-king perpetually when he
      dined at his table. In short, he intrigued in a dumb sort of way; but had
      never yet obtained a look in return from the king of his choice. The
      worthy man had more than once thought, but was not yet decided, to beg
      Monsieur Minard to assist him in obtaining his secret desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phellion, a man of passive obedience, was stoical in the matter of duty,
      and iron in all that touched his conscience. To complete this picture by a
      sketch of his person, we must add that at fifty-nine years of age Phellion
      had &ldquo;thickened,&rdquo; to use a term of the bourgeois vocabulary. His face, of
      one monotonous tone and pitted with the small-pox, had grown to resemble a
      full moon; so that his lips, formerly large, now seemed of ordinary size.
      His eyes, much weakened, and protected by glasses, no longer showed the
      innocence of their light-blue orbs, which in former days had often excited
      a smile; his white hair now gave gravity to much that twelve years earlier
      had looked like silliness, and lent itself to ridicule. Time, which does
      such damage to faces with refined and delicate features, only improves
      those which, in their youth, have been course and massive. This was the
      case with Phellion. He occupied the leisure of his old age in making an
      abridgment of the History of France; for Phellion was the author of
      several works adopted by the University.
    </p>
    <p>
      When la Peyrade presented himself, the family were all together. Madame
      Barniol was just telling her mother about one of her babies, which was
      slightly indisposed. They were dressed in their Sunday clothes, and were
      sitting before the fireplace of the wainscoted salon on chairs bought at a
      bargain; and they all felt an emotion when Genevieve, the cook and
      portress, announced the personage of whom they were just then speaking in
      connection with Celeste, whom, we must here state, Felix Phellion loved,
      to the extent of going to mass to behold her. The learned mathematician
      had made that effort in the morning, and the family were joking him about
      it in a pleasant way, hoping in their hearts that Celeste and her parents
      might understand the treasure that was thus offered to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! the Thuilliers seem to me infatuated with a very dangerous man,&rdquo;
       said Madame Phellion. &ldquo;He took Madame Colleville by the arm this morning
      after church, and they went together to the Luxembourg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something about that lawyer,&rdquo; remarked Felix Phellion, &ldquo;that
      strikes me as sinister. He might be found to have committed some crime and
      I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going too far,&rdquo; said old Phellion. &ldquo;He is cousin-germain to
      Tartuffe, that immortal figure cast in bronze by our honest Moliere; for
      Moliere, my children, had honesty and patriotism for the basis of his
      genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at that instant that Genevieve came in to say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Monsieur
      de la Peyrade out there, who wants to see monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see me!&rdquo; exclaimed Phellion. &ldquo;Ask him to come in,&rdquo; he added, with that
      solemnity in little things which gave him even now a touch of absurdity,
      though it always impressed his family, which accepted him as king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phellion, his two sons, and his wife and daughter, rose and received the
      circular bow made by the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what do we owe the honor of your visit, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Phellion,
      stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your importance in this arrondissement, my dear Monsieur Phellion, and
      to public interests,&rdquo; replied Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us go into my study,&rdquo; said Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my friend,&rdquo; said the rigid Madame Phellion, a small woman, flat
      as a flounder, who retained upon her features the grim severity with which
      she taught music in boarding-schools for young ladies; &ldquo;we will leave
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An upright Erard piano, placed between the two windows and opposite to the
      fireplace, showed the constant occupation of a proficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so unfortunate as to put you to flight?&rdquo; said Theodose, smiling in a
      kindly way at the mother and daughter. &ldquo;You have a delightful retreat
      here,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You only lack a pretty daughter-in-law to pass the
      rest of your days in this &lsquo;aurea mediocritas,&rsquo; the wish of the Latin poet,
      surrounded by family joys. Your antecedents, my dear Monsieur Phellion,
      ought surely to win you such rewards, for I am told that you are not only
      a patriot but a good citizen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Phellion, embarrassed, &ldquo;monsieur, I have only done my
      duty.&rdquo; At the word &ldquo;daughter-in-law,&rdquo; uttered by Theodose, Madame Barniol,
      who resembled her mother as much as one drop of water is like another,
      looked at Madame Phellion and at Felix as if she would say, &ldquo;Were we
      mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desire to talk this incident over carried all four personages into the
      garden, for, in March, 1840, the weather was spring-like, at least in
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commander,&rdquo; said Theodose, as soon as he was alone with Phellion, who was
      always flattered by that title, &ldquo;I have come to speak to you about the
      election&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, true; we are about to nominate a municipal councillor,&rdquo; said
      Phellion, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is apropos of that candidacy that I have come to disturb your
      Sunday joys; but perhaps in so doing we shall not go beyond the limits of
      the family circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible for Phellion to be more Phellion than Theodose was
      Phellion at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not let you say another word,&rdquo; replied the commander, profiting
      by the pause made by Theodose, who watched for the effect of his speech.
      &ldquo;My choice is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had the same idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Theodose; &ldquo;men of the same
      character agree as well as men of the same mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this case I do not believe in that phenomenon,&rdquo; replied Phellion.
      &ldquo;This arrondissement had for its representative in the municipal council
      the most virtuous of men, as he was the noblest of magistrates. I allude
      to the late Monsieur Popinot, the deceased judge of the Royal courts. When
      the question of replacing him came up, his nephew, the heir to his
      benevolence, did not reside in this quarter. He has since, however,
      purchased, and now occupies, the house where his uncle lived in the rue de
      la Montagne-Sainte-Genevieve; he is the physician of the Ecole
      Polytechnique and that of our hospitals; he does honor to this quarter;
      for these reasons, and to pay homage in the person of the nephew to the
      memory of the uncle, we have decided to nominate Doctor Horace Bianchon,
      member of the Academy of Sciences, as you are aware, and one of the most
      distinguished young men in the illustrious faculty of Paris. A man is not
      great in our eyes solely because he is celebrated; to my mind the late
      Councillor Popinot was almost another Saint Vincent de Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a doctor is not an administrator,&rdquo; replied Theodose; &ldquo;and, besides, I
      have come to ask your vote for a man to whom your dearest interests
      require that you should sacrifice a predilection, which, after all, is
      quite unimportant to the public welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; cried Phellion, rising and striking an attitude like that of
      Lafon in &ldquo;Le Glorieux,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you despise me sufficiently to suppose that my
      personal interests could ever influence my political conscience? When a
      matter concerns the public welfare, I am a citizen&mdash;nothing more, and
      nothing less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose smiled to himself at the thought of the battle which was now to
      take place between the father and the citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not bind yourself to your present ideas, I entreat you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
      this matter concerns the happiness of your dear Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by those words?&rdquo; asked Phellion, stopping short in the
      middle of the salon and posing, with his hand thrust through the bosom of
      his waistcoat from right to left, in the well-known attitude of Odilon
      Barrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come in behalf of our mutual friend, the worthy and excellent
      Monsieur Thuillier, whose influence on the destiny of that beautiful
      Celeste Colleville must be well known to you. If, as I think, your son,
      whose merits are incontestable, and of whom both families may well be
      proud, if, I say, he is courting Celeste with a view to a marriage in
      which all expediencies may be combined, you cannot do more to promote that
      end than to obtain Thuillier&rsquo;s eternal gratitude by proposing your worthy
      friend to the suffrages of your fellow-citizens. As for me, though I have
      lately come into the quarter, I can, thanks to the influence I enjoy
      through certain legal benefits done to the poor, materially advance his
      interests. I might, perhaps, have put myself forward for this position;
      but serving the poor brings in but little money; and, besides, the modesty
      of my life is out of keeping with such distinctions. I have devoted
      myself, monsieur, to the service of the weak, like the late Councillor
      Popinot,&mdash;a sublime man, as you justly remarked. If I had not already
      chosen a career which is in some sort monastic, and precludes all idea of
      marriage and public office, my taste, my second vocation, would lead me to
      the service of God, to the Church. I do not trumpet what I do, like the
      philanthropists; I do not write about it; I simply act; I am pledged to
      Christian charity. The ambition of our friend Thuillier becoming known to
      me, I have wished to contribute to the happiness of two young people who
      seem to me made for each other, by suggesting to you the means of winning
      the rather cold heart of Monsieur Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phellion was bewildered by this tirade, admirably delivered; he was
      dazzled, attracted; but he remained Phellion; he walked up to the lawyer
      and held out his hand, which la Peyrade took.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the commander, with emotion, &ldquo;I have misjudged you. What
      you have done me the honor to confide to me will die <i>there</i>,&rdquo; laying
      his hand on his heart. &ldquo;You are one of the men of whom we have too few,&mdash;men
      who console us for many evils inherent in our social state. Righteousness
      is seen so seldom that our too feeble natures distrust appearances. You
      have in me a friend, if you will allow me the honor of assuming that
      title. But you must learn to know me, monsieur. I should lose my own
      esteem if I nominated Thuillier. No, my son shall never own his happiness
      to an evil action on his father&rsquo;s part. I shall not change my candidate
      because my son&rsquo;s interests demand it. That is civic virtue, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade pulled out his handkerchief and rubbed it in his eye so that it
      drew a tear, as he said, holding out his hand to Phellion, and turning
      aside his head:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, how sublime a struggle between public and private duty! Had
      I come here only to see this sight, my visit would not have been wasted.
      You cannot do otherwise! In your place, I should do the same. You are that
      noblest thing that God has made&mdash;a righteous man! a citizen of the
      Jean-Jacques type! With many such citizens, oh France! my country! what
      mightest thou become! It is I, monsieur, who solicit, humbly, the honor to
      be your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be happening?&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, watching the scene through
      the window. &ldquo;Do see your father and that horrid man embracing each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phellion and la Peyrade now came out and joined the family in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Felix,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing to la Peyrade, who was bowing
      to Madame Phellion, &ldquo;be very grateful to that admirable young man; he will
      prove most useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer walked for about five minutes with Madame Barniol and Madame
      Phellion beneath the leafless lindens, and gave them (in consequence of
      the embarrassing circumstances created by Phellion&rsquo;s political obstinacy)
      a piece of advice, the effects of which were to bear fruit that evening,
      while its first result was to make both ladies admire his talents, his
      frankness, and his inappreciable good qualities. When the lawyer departed
      the whole family conducted him to the street gate, and all eyes followed
      him until he had turned the corner of the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques.
      Madame Phellion then took the arm of her husband to return to the salon,
      saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! my friend! what does this mean? You, such a good father, how can
      you, from excessive delicacy, stand in the way of such a fine marriage for
      our Felix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Phellion, &ldquo;the great men of antiquity, Brutus and
      others, were never fathers when called upon to be citizens. The
      bourgeoisie has, even more than the aristocracy whose place it has been
      called upon to take, the obligations of the highest virtues. Monsieur de
      Saint-Hilaire did not think of his lost arm in presence of the dead
      Turenne. We must give proof of our worthiness; let us give it at every
      state of the social hierarchy. Shall I instruct my family in the highest
      civic principles only to ignore them myself at the moment for applying
      them? No, my dear; weep, if you must, to-day, but to-morrow you will
      respect me,&rdquo; he added, seeing tears in the eyes of his starched better
      half.
    </p>
    <p>
      These noble words were said on the sill of the door, above which was
      written, &ldquo;Aurea mediocritas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have put, &lsquo;et digna,&rsquo;&rdquo; added Phellion, pointing to the tablet,
      &ldquo;but those two words would imply self-praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Marie-Theodore Phellion, the future engineer of &ldquo;ponts et
      chaussees,&rdquo; when the family were once more seated in the salon, &ldquo;it seems
      to me that there is nothing dishonorable in changing one&rsquo;s determination
      about a choice which is of no real consequence to public welfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No consequence, my son!&rdquo; cried Phellion. &ldquo;Between ourselves I will say,
      and Felix shares my opinion, Monsieur Thuillier is absolutely without
      capacity; he knows nothing. Monsieur Horace Bianchon is an able man; he
      will obtain a thousand things for our arrondissement, and Thuillier will
      obtain none! Remember this, my son; to change a good determination for a
      bad one from motives of self-interest is one of those infamous actions
      which escape the control of men but are punished by God. I am, or I think
      I am, void of all blame before my conscience, and I owe it to you, my
      children, to leave my memory unstained among you. Nothing, therefore, can
      make me change my determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good father!&rdquo; cried the little Barniol woman, flinging herself on
      a cushion at Phellion&rsquo;s knees, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ride your high horse! There are many
      fools and idiots in the municipal council, and France gets along all the
      same. That old Thuillier will adopt the opinions of those about him. Do
      reflect that Celeste will probably have five hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might have millions,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;and I might see them there at
      my feet before I would propose Thuillier, when I owe to the memory of the
      best of men to nominate, if possible, Horace Bianchon, his nephew. From
      the heaven above us Popinot is contemplating and applauding me!&rdquo; cried
      Phellion, with exaltation. &ldquo;It is by such considerations as you suggest
      that France is being lowered, and the bourgeoisie are bringing themselves
      into contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is right,&rdquo; said Felix, coming out of a deep reverie. &ldquo;He
      deserves our respect and love; as he has throughout the whole course of
      his modest and honored life. I would not owe my happiness either to
      remorse in his noble soul, or to a low political bargain. I love Celeste
      as I love my own family; but, above all that, I place my father&rsquo;s honor,
      and since this question is a matter of conscience with him it must not be
      spoken of again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phellion, with his eyes full of tears, went up to his eldest son and took
      him in his arms, saying, &ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; in a choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is nonsense,&rdquo; whispered Madame Phellion in Madame Barniol&rsquo;s ear.
      &ldquo;Come and dress me; I shall make an end of this; I know your father; he
      has put his foot down now. To carry out the plan that pious young man,
      Theodose, suggested, I want your help; hold yourself ready to give it, my
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Genevieve came in and gave a letter to Monsieur Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An invitation for dinner to-day, for Madame Phellion and Felix and
      myself, at the Thuilliers&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent and surprising idea of Thuillier&rsquo;s municipal advancement,
      put forth by the &ldquo;advocate of the poor&rdquo; was not less upsetting in the
      Thuillier household than it was in the Phellion salon. Jerome Thuillier,
      without actually confiding anything to his sister, for he made it a point
      of honor to obey his Mephistopheles, had rushed to her in great excitement
      to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest girl&rdquo; (he always touched her heart with those caressing
      words), &ldquo;we shall have some big-wigs at dinner to-day. I&rsquo;m going to ask
      the Minards; therefore take pains about your dinner. I have written to
      Monsieur and Madame Phellion; it is rather late; but there&rsquo;s no need of
      ceremony with them. As for the Minards, I must throw a little dust in
      their eyes; I have a particular need of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four Minards, three Phellions, four Collevilles, and ourselves; that
      makes thirteen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Peyrade, fourteen; and it is worth while to invite Dutocq; he may be
      useful to us. I&rsquo;ll go up and see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you scheming?&rdquo; cried his sister. &ldquo;Fifteen to dinner! There&rsquo;s
      forty francs, at the very least, waltzing off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t regret them, my dearest. I want you to be particularly
      agreeable to our young friend, la Peyrade. There&rsquo;s a friend, indeed!
      you&rsquo;ll soon have proofs of that! If you love me, cosset him well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he departed, leaving Brigitte bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proofs, indeed! yes, I&rsquo;ll look out for proofs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to be
      caught with fine words, not I! He is an amiable fellow; but before I take
      him into my heart I shall study him a little closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After inviting Dutocq, Thuillier, having bedizened himself, went to the
      hotel Minard, rue des Macons-Sorbonne, to capture the stout Zelie, and
      gloss over the shortness of the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minard had purchased one of those large and sumptuous habitations which
      the old religious orders built about the Sorbonne, and as Thuillier
      mounted the broad stone steps with an iron balustrade, that proved how
      arts of the second class flourished under Louis XIII., he envied both the
      mansion and its occupant,&mdash;the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vast building, standing between a courtyard and garden, is noticeable
      as a specimen of the style, both noble and elegant, of the reign of Louis
      XIII., coming singularly, as it did, between the bad taste of the expiring
      renaissance and the heavy grandeur of Louis XIV., at its dawn. This
      transition period is shown in many public buildings. The massive
      scroll-work of several facades&mdash;that of the Sorbonne, for instance,&mdash;and
      columns rectified according to the rules of Grecian art, were beginning to
      appear in this architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grocer, a lucky adulterator, now took the place of the former
      ecclesiastical governor of an institution called in former times
      L&rsquo;Economat; an establishment connected with the general agency of the old
      French clergy, and founded by the long-sighted genius of Richelieu.
      Thuillier&rsquo;s name opened for him the doors of the salon, where sat
      enthroned in velvet and gold, amid the most magnificent &ldquo;Chineseries,&rdquo; the
      poor woman who weighed with all her avoirdupois on the hearts and minds of
      princes and princesses at the &ldquo;popular balls&rdquo; of the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a good subject for &lsquo;La Caricature&rsquo;?&rdquo; said a so-called lady of
      the bedchamber to a duchess, who could hardly help laughing at the aspect
      of Zelie, glittering with diamonds, red as a poppy, squeezed into a gold
      brocade, and rolling along like the casts of her former shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you pardon me, fair lady,&rdquo; began Thuillier, twisting his body, and
      pausing in pose number two of his imperial repertory, &ldquo;for having allowed
      this invitation to remain in my desk, thinking, all the while, that it was
      sent? It is for to-day, but perhaps I am too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zelie examined her husband&rsquo;s face as he approached them to receive
      Thuillier; then she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We intended to drive into the country and dine at some chance restaurant;
      but we&rsquo;ll give up that idea and all the more readily because, in my
      opinion, it is getting devilishly vulgar to drive out of Paris on
      Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have a little dance to the piano for the young people, if enough
      come, as I hope they will. I have sent a line to Phellion, whose wife is
      intimate with Madame Pron, the successor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Successor<i>ess</i>,&rdquo; interrupted Madame Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;it ought to be success&rsquo;ress; just as we say
      may&rsquo;ress, dropping the O, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it full dress?&rdquo; asked Madame Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! no,&rdquo; replied Thuillier; &ldquo;you would get me finely scolded by my
      sister. No, it is only a family party. Under the Empire, madame, we all
      devoted ourselves to dancing. At that great epoch of our national life
      they thought as much of a fine dancer as they did of a good soldier.
      Nowadays the country is so matter-of-fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t talk politics,&rdquo; said the mayor, smiling. &ldquo;The King is
      grand; he is very able. I have a deep admiration for my own time, and for
      the institutions which we have given to ourselves. The King, you may be
      sure, knows very well what he is doing by the development of industries.
      He is struggling hand to hand against England; and we are doing him more
      harm during this fruitful peace than all the wars of the Empire would have
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a deputy Minard would make!&rdquo; cried Zelie, naively. &ldquo;He practises
      speechifying at home. You&rsquo;ll help us to get him elected, won&rsquo;t you,
      Thuillier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t talk politics now,&rdquo; replied Thuillier. &ldquo;Come at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that little Vinet be there?&rdquo; asked Minard; &ldquo;he comes, no doubt, for
      Celeste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he may go into mourning,&rdquo; replied Thuillier. &ldquo;Brigitte won&rsquo;t hear of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zelie and Minard exchanged a smile of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that we must hob-nob with such common people, all for the sake
      of our son!&rdquo; cried Zelie, when Thuillier was safely down the staircase, to
      which the mayor had accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! he thinks to be deputy!&rdquo; thought Thuillier, as he walked away. &ldquo;These
      grocers! nothing satisfies them. Heavens! what would Napoleon say if he
      could see the government in the hands of such people! I&rsquo;m a trained
      administrator, at any rate. What a competitor, to be sure! I wonder what
      la Peyrade will say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambitious ex-beau now went to invite the whole Laudigeois family for
      the evening, after which he went to the Collevilles&rsquo;, to make sure that
      Celeste should wear a becoming gown. He found Flavie rather pensive. She
      hesitated about coming, but Thuillier overcame her indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My old and ever young friend,&rdquo; he said, taking her round the waist, for
      she was alone in her little salon, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have any secret from you. A
      great affair is in the wind for me. I can&rsquo;t tell you more than that, but I
      can ask you to be particularly charming to a certain young man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He holds my future in his hands. Besides, he&rsquo;s a man of genius. I know
      what that is. He&rsquo;s got this sort of thing,&rdquo;&mdash;and Thuillier made the
      gesture of a dentist pulling out a back tooth. &ldquo;We must bind him to us,
      Flavie. But, above all, don&rsquo;t let him see his power. As for me, I shall
      just give and take with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to be coquettish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much so, my angel,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, with a foppish air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he departed, not observing the stupor which overcame Flavie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man is a power,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Well, we shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For these reasons she dressed her hair with marabouts, put on her
      prettiest gown of gray and pink, which allowed her fine shoulders to be
      seen beneath a pelerine of black lace, and took care to keep Celeste in a
      little silk frock made with a yoke and a large plaited collarette, telling
      her to dress her hair plainly, a la Berthe.

      CHAPTER VIII. AD MAJOREM THEODOSIS GLORIAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      At half-past four o&rsquo;clock Theodose was at his post. He had put on his
      vacant, half-servile manner and soft voice, and he drew Thuillier at once
      into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt your triumph, but I feel the
      necessity of again warning you to be absolutely silent. If you are
      questioned about anything, especially about Celeste, make evasive answers
      which will keep your questioners in suspense. You must have learned how to
      do that in a government office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;But what certainty have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see what a fine dessert I have prepared for you. But please be
      modest. There come the Minards; let me pipe to them. Bring them out here,
      and then disappear yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the first salutations, la Peyrade was careful to keep close to the
      mayor, and presently at an opportune moment he drew him aside to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le maire, a man of your political importance doesn&rsquo;t come to
      bore himself in a house of this kind without an object. I don&rsquo;t want to
      fathom your motives&mdash;which, indeed, I have no right to do&mdash;and
      my part in this world is certainly not to mingle with earthly powers; but
      please pardon my apparent presumption, and deign to listen to a piece of
      advice which I shall venture to give you. If I do you a service to-day you
      are in a position to return it to me to-morrow; therefore, in case I
      should be so fortunate as to do you a good turn, I am really only obeying
      the law of self-interest. Our friend Thuillier is in despair at being a
      nobody; he has taken it into his head that he wants to become a personage
      in this arrondissement&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing very exalted; he wants to be elected to the municipal
      council. Now, I know that Phellion, seeing the influence such a service
      would have on his family interests, intends to propose your poor friend as
      candidate. Well, perhaps you might think it wise, in your own interests,
      to be beforehand with him. Thuillier&rsquo;s nomination could only be favorable
      for you&mdash;I mean agreeable; and he&rsquo;ll fill his place in the council
      very well; there are some there who are not as strong as he. Besides,
      owing to his place to your support, he will see with your eyes; he already
      looks to you as one of the lights of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I thank you very much,&rdquo; replied Minard. &ldquo;You are doing me
      a service I cannot sufficiently acknowledge, and which proves to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t like those Phellions,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, taking advantage of
      a slight hesitation on the part of the mayor, who feared to express an
      idea in which the lawyer might see contempt. &ldquo;I hate people who make
      capital out of their honesty and coin money from fine sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know them well,&rdquo; said Minard; &ldquo;they are sycophants. That man&rsquo;s whole
      life for the last ten years is explained by this bit of red ribbon,&rdquo; added
      the mayor, pointing to his own buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;his son is in love with Celeste, and he&rsquo;s
      fairly in the heart of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but my son has twelve thousand a year in his own right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Theodose, with a start, &ldquo;Mademoiselle Brigitte was saying the
      other day that she wanted at least as much as that in Celeste&rsquo;s suitor.
      Moreover, six months hence you&rsquo;ll probably hear that Thuillier has a
      property worth forty thousand francs a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil! well, I thought as much. Yes, certainly, he shall be made a
      member of the municipal council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, don&rsquo;t say anything about me to him,&rdquo; said the advocate of
      the poor, who now hastened away to speak to Madame Phellion. &ldquo;Well, my
      fair lady,&rdquo; he said, when he reached her, &ldquo;have you succeeded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited till four o&rsquo;clock, and then that worthy and excellent man would
      not let me finish what I had to say. He is much to busy to accept such an
      office, and he sent a letter which Monsieur Phellion has read, saying that
      he, Doctor Bianchon, thanked him for his good intentions, and assured him
      that his own candidate was Monsieur Thuillier. He said that he should use
      all his influence in his favor, and begged my husband to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did your excellent husband say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have done my duty,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have not been false to my conscience,
      and now I am all for Thuillier.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the thing is settled,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;Ignore my visit, and
      take all the credit of the idea to yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to Madame Colleville, composing himself in the attitude and
      manner of the deepest respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have the goodness to send out to me here that kindly
      papa Colleville. A surprise is to be given to Monsieur Thuillier, and I
      want Monsieur Colleville to be in the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While la Peyrade played the part of man of the world with Colleville, and
      allowed himself various witty sarcasms when explaining to him Thuillier&rsquo;s
      candidacy, telling him he ought to support it, if only to exhibit his
      incapacity, Flavie was listening in the salon to the following
      conversation, which bewildered her for the moment and made her ears ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know what Monsieur Colleville and Monsieur de la Peyrade
      can be saying to each other to make them laugh like that,&rdquo; said Madame
      Thuillier, foolishly, looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of improper things, as men always do when they talk together,&rdquo;
       replied Mademoiselle Thuillier, who often attacked men with the sort of
      instinct natural to old maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are incapable of that,&rdquo; said Phellion, gravely. &ldquo;Monsieur de la
      Peyrade is one of the most virtuous young men I have ever met. People know
      what I think of Felix; well, I put the two on the same line; indeed, I
      wish my son had a little more of Monsieur de la Peyrade&rsquo;s beautiful
      piety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; he is a man of great merit, who is sure to succeed,&rdquo; said
      Minard. &ldquo;As for me, my suffrages&mdash;for I really ought not to say
      protection&mdash;are his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pays more for oil than for bread,&rdquo; said Dutocq. &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother, if he has the happiness to still possess her, must be proud
      of him,&rdquo; remarked Madame Thuillier, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a real treasure for us,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;If you only knew how
      modest he is! He doesn&rsquo;t do himself justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer for one thing,&rdquo; added Dutocq; &ldquo;no young man ever maintained
      a nobler attitude in poverty; he triumphed over it; but he suffered&mdash;it
      is easy to see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo; cried Zelie. &ldquo;Such things make my heart ache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one could safely trust both secrets and fortune to him,&rdquo; said
      Thuillier; &ldquo;and in these days that is the finest thing that can be said of
      a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Colleville who is making him laugh,&rdquo; cried Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Colleville and la Peyrade returned from the garden the very best
      friends in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;the soup and the King must never be kept
      waiting; give your hand to the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after this little pleasantry (issuing from the lodge of her
      father the porter) Brigitte had the satisfaction of seeing her table
      surrounded by the principal personages of this drama; the rest, with the
      one exception of the odious Cerizet, arrived later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait of the former maker of canvas money-bags would be incomplete
      if we omitted to give a description of one of her best dinners. The
      physiognomy of the bourgeois cook of 1840 is, moreover, one of those
      details essentially necessary to a history of manners and customs, and
      clever housewives may find some lessons in it. A woman doesn&rsquo;t make empty
      bags for twenty years without looking out for the means to fill a few of
      them. Now Brigitte had one peculiar characteristic. She united the economy
      to which she owed her fortune with a full understanding of necessary
      expenses. Her relative prodigality, when it concerned her brother or
      Celeste, was the antipodes of avarice. In fact, she often bemoaned herself
      that she couldn&rsquo;t be miserly. At her last dinner she had related how,
      after struggling ten minute and enduring martyrdom, she had ended by
      giving ten francs to a poor workwoman whom she knew, positively, had been
      without food for two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; she said naively, &ldquo;is stronger than reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soup was a rather pale bouillon; for, even on an occasion like this,
      the cook had been enjoined to make a great deal of bouillon out of the
      beef supplied. Then, as the said beef was to feed the family on the next
      day and the day after that, the less juice it expended in the bouillon,
      the more substantial were the subsequent dinners. The beef, little cooked,
      was always taken away at the following speech from Brigitte, uttered as
      soon as Thuillier put his knife into it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is rather tough; send it away, Thuillier, nobody will eat it;
      we have other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soup was, in fact, flanked by four viands mounted on old hot-water
      chafing-dishes, with the plating worn off. At this particular dinner
      (afterwards called that of the candidacy) the first course consisted of a
      pair of ducks with olives, opposite to which was a large pie with
      forcemeat balls, while a dish of eels &ldquo;a la tartare&rdquo; corresponded in like
      manner with a fricandeau on chicory. The second course had for its central
      dish a most dignified goose stuffed with chestnuts, a salad of vegetables
      garnished with rounds of beetroot opposite to custards in cups, while
      lower down a dish of turnips &ldquo;au sucre&rdquo; faced a timbale of macaroni. This
      gala dinner of the concierge type cost, at the utmost, twenty francs, and
      the remains of the feast provided the household for a couple of days;
      nevertheless, Brigitte would say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pest! when one has to have company how the money goes! It is fearful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The table was lighted by two hideous candlesticks of plated silver with
      four branches each, in which shone eight of those thrifty wax-candles that
      go by the name of Aurora. The linen was dazzling in whiteness, and the
      silver, with beaded edges, was the fruit, evidently, of some purchase made
      during the Revolution by Thuillier&rsquo;s father. Thus the fare and the service
      were in keeping with the house, the dining-room, and the Thuilliers
      themselves, who could never, under any circumstances, get themselves above
      this style of living. The Minards, Collevilles, and la Peyrade exchanged
      now and then a smile which betrayed their mutually satirical but repressed
      thoughts. La Peyrade, seated beside Flavie, whispered in her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit that they ought to be taught how to live. But those
      Minards are no better in their way. What cupidity! they&rsquo;ve come here
      solely after Celeste. Your daughter will be lost to you if you let them
      have her. These parvenus have all the vices of the great lords of other
      days without their elegance. Minard&rsquo;s son, who has twelve thousand francs
      a year of his own, could very well find a wife elsewhere, instead of
      pushing his speculating rake in here. What fun it would be to play upon
      those people as one would on a bass-viol or a clarionet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the dishes of the second course were being removed, Minard, afraid
      that Phellion would precede him, said to Thuillier with a grave air:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Thuillier, in accepting your dinner, I did so for the purpose of
      making an important communication, which does you so much honor that all
      here present ought to be made participants in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you obtained the cross for me?&rdquo; he cried, on receiving a glance from
      Theodose, and wishing to prove that he was not without craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will doubtless receive it ere long,&rdquo; replied the mayor. &ldquo;But the
      matter now relates to something better than that. The cross is a favor due
      to the good opinion of a minister, whereas the present question concerns
      an election due to the consent of your fellow citizens. In a word, a
      sufficiently large number of electors in your arrondissement have cast
      their eyes upon you, and wish to honor you with their confidence by making
      you the representative of this arrondissement in the municipal council of
      Paris; which, as everybody knows, is the Council-general of the Seine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phellion rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le maire has forestalled me,&rdquo; he said in an agitated voice, &ldquo;but
      it is so flattering for our friend to be the object of eagerness on the
      part of all good citizens, and to obtain the public vote of high and low,
      that I cannot complain of being obliged to come second only; therefore,
      all honor to the initiatory authority!&rdquo; (Here he bowed respectfully to
      Minard.) &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Thuillier, many electors think of giving you their
      votes in that portion of the arrondissement where I keep my humble
      penates; and you have the special advantage of being suggested to their
      minds by a distinguished man.&rdquo; (Sensation.) &ldquo;By a man in whose person we
      desired to honor one of the most virtuous inhabitants of the
      arrondissement, who for twenty years, I may say, was the father of it. I
      allude to the late Monsieur Popinot, counsellor, during his lifetime, to
      the Royal court, and our delegate in the municipal council of Paris. But
      his nephew, of whom I speak, Doctor Bianchon, one of our glories, has, in
      view of his absorbing duties, declined the responsibility with which we
      sought to invest him. While thanking us for our compliment he has&mdash;take
      note of this&mdash;indicated for our suffrages the candidate of Monsieur
      le maire as being, in his opinion, capable, owing to the position he
      formerly occupied, of exercising the magisterial functions of the
      aedileship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Phellion sat down amid approving murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier, you can count on me, your old friend,&rdquo; said Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the guests were sincerely touched by the sight presented of
      old Mademoiselle Brigitte and Madame Thuillier. Brigitte, pale as though
      she were fainting, was letting the slow tears run, unheeded, down her
      cheeks, tears of deepest joy; while Madame Thuillier sat, as if struck by
      lightning, with her eyes fixed. Suddenly the old maid darted into the
      kitchen, crying out to Josephine the cook:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the cellar my girl, we must get out the wine behind the wood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Thuillier, in a shaking voice, &ldquo;this is the finest
      moment of my life, finer than even the day of my election, should I
      consent to allow myself to be presented to the suffrages of my
      fellow-citizens&rdquo; (&ldquo;You must! you must!&rdquo;); &ldquo;for I feel myself much worn
      down by thirty years of public service, and, as you may well believe, a
      man of honor has need to consult his strength and his capacities before he
      takes upon himself the functions of the aedileship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected nothing less of you, Monsieur Thuillier,&rdquo; cried Phellion.
      &ldquo;Pardon me; this is the first time in my life that I have ever interrupted
      a superior; but there are circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept! accept!&rdquo; cried Zelie. &ldquo;Bless my soul! what we want are men like
      you to govern us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resign yourself, my chief!&rdquo; cried Dutocq, and, &ldquo;Long live the future
      municipal councillor! but we haven&rsquo;t anything to drink&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the thing is settled,&rdquo; said Minard; &ldquo;you are to be our candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think too much of me,&rdquo; replied Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; cried Colleville. &ldquo;A man who has done thirty years in the
      galleys of the ministry of finance is a treasure to the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much too modest,&rdquo; said the younger Minard; &ldquo;your capacity is well
      known to us; it remains a tradition at the ministry of finance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you all insist&mdash;&rdquo; began Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King will be pleased with our choice; I can assure you of that,&rdquo; said
      Minard, pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;will you permit a recent dweller in the
      faubourg Saint-Jacques to make one little remark, which is not without
      importance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consciousness that everybody had of the sterling merits of the
      advocate of the poor produced the deepest silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The influence of Monsieur le maire of an adjoining arrondissement, which
      is immense in ours where he has left such excellent memories; that of
      Monsieur Phellion, the oracle&mdash;yes, let the truth be spoken,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, noticing a gesture made by Phellion&mdash;&ldquo;the <i>oracle</i> of
      his battalion; the influence, no less powerful, which Monsieur Colleville
      owes to the frank heartiness of his manner, and to his urbanity; that of
      Monsieur Dutocq, the clerk of the justice court, which will not be less
      efficacious, I am sure; and the poor efforts which I can offer in my
      humble sphere of activity,&mdash;are pledges of success, but they are not
      success itself. To obtain a rapid triumph we should pledge ourselves, now
      and here, to keep the deepest secrecy on the manifestation of sentiments
      which has just taken place. Otherwise, we should excite, without knowing
      or willing it, envy and all the other secondary passions, which would
      create for us later various obstacles to overcome. The political meaning
      of the new social organization, its very basis, its token, and the
      guarantee for its continuance, are in a certain sharing of the governing
      power with the middle classes, classes who are the true strength of modern
      societies, the centre of morality, of all good sentiments and intelligent
      work. But we cannot conceal from ourselves that the principle of election,
      extended now to almost every function, has brought the interests of
      ambition, and the passion for being <i>something</i>, excuse the word,
      into social depths where they ought never to have penetrated. Some see
      good in this; others see evil; it is not my place to judge between them in
      presence of minds before whose eminence I bow. I content myself by simply
      suggesting this question in order to show the dangers which the banner of
      our friend must meet. See for yourselves! the decease of our late
      honorable representative in the municipal council dates back scarcely one
      week, and already the arrondissement is being canvassed by inferior
      ambitions. Such men put themselves forward to be seen at any price. The
      writ of convocation will, probably, not take effect for a month to come.
      Between now and then, imagine the intrigues! I entreat you not to expose
      our friend Thuillier to the blows of his competitors; let us not deliver
      him over to public discussion, that modern harpy which is but the trumpet
      of envy and calumny, the pretext seized by malevolence to belittle all
      that is great, soil all that is immaculate and dishonor whatever is
      sacred. Let us, rather, do as the Third Party is now doing in the Chamber,&mdash;keep
      silence and vote!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks well,&rdquo; said Phellion to his neighbor Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how strong the statement is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Envy had turned Minard and his son green and yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well said and very true,&rdquo; remarked Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unanimously adopted!&rdquo; cried Colleville. &ldquo;Messieurs, we are men of honor;
      it suffices to understand each other on this point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoso desires the end accepts the means,&rdquo; said Phellion, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Mademoiselle Thuillier reappeared, followed by her two
      servants; the key of the cellar was hanging from her belt, and three
      bottles of champagne, three of hermitage, and one bottle of malaga were
      placed upon the table. She herself was carrying, with almost respectful
      care, a smaller bottle, like a fairy Carabosse, which she placed before
      her. In the midst of the hilarity caused by this abundance of excellent
      things&mdash;a fruit of gratitude, which the poor spinster in the delirium
      of her joy poured out with a profusion which put to shame the sparing
      hospitality of her usual fortnightly dinners&mdash;numerous dessert dishes
      made their appearance: mounds of almonds, raisins, figs, and nuts
      (popularly known as the &ldquo;four beggars&rdquo;), pyramids of oranges, confections,
      crystallized fruits, brought from the hidden depths of her cupboards,
      which would never have figured on the table-cloth had it not been for the
      &ldquo;candidacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste, they will bring you a bottle of brandy which my father obtained
      in 1802; make an orange-salad!&rdquo; cried Brigitte to her sister-in-law.
      &ldquo;Monsieur Phellion, open the champagne; that bottle is for you three.
      Monsieur Dutocq, take this one. Monsieur Colleville, you know how to pop
      corks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two maids distributed champagne glasses, also claret glasses, and wine
      glasses. Josephine also brought three more bottles of Bordeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The year of the comet!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, laughing, &ldquo;Messieurs, you have
      turned my sister&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this evening you shall have punch and cakes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have sent
      to the chemists for some tea. Heavens! if I had only known the affair
      concerned an election,&rdquo; she cried, looking at her sister-in-law, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have
      served the turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh welcomed this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a goose!&rdquo; said Minard junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carts are unloading!&rdquo; cried Madame Thuillier, as &ldquo;marrons glaces&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;meringues&rdquo; were placed upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Thuillier&rsquo;s face was blazing. She was really superb to
      behold. Never did sisterly love assume such a frenzied expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those who know her, it is really touching,&rdquo; remarked Madame
      Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glasses were filled. The guests all looked at one another, evidently
      expecting a toast, whereupon la Peyrade said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, let us drink to something sublime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Mademoiselle Brigitte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all rose, clinked glasses, and cried with one voice, &ldquo;Mademoiselle
      Brigitte!&rdquo; so much enthusiasm did the exhibition of a true feeling excite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said Phellion, reading from a paper written in pencil, &ldquo;To
      work and its splendors, in the person of our former comrade, now become
      one of the mayors of Paris,&mdash;to Monsieur Minard and his wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After five minutes&rsquo; general conversation Thuillier rose and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, To the King and the royal family! I add nothing; the toast
      says all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the election of my brother!&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Thuillier a moment
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll make you laugh,&rdquo; whispered la Peyrade in Flavie&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Woman!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that enchanting sex to whom we owe our happiness,&mdash;not
      to speak of our mothers, our sisters, and our wives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This toast excited general hilarity, and Colleville, already somewhat gay,
      exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rascal! you have stolen my speech!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mayor then rose; profound silence reigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, our institutions! from which come the strength and grandeur of
      dynastic France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottles disappeared amid a chorus of admiration as to the marvellous
      goodness and delicacy of their contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste Colleville here said timidly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, will you permit me to give a toast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good girl had noticed the dull, bewildered look of her godmother,
      neglected and forgotten,&mdash;she, the mistress of that house, wearing
      almost the expression of a dog that is doubtful which master to obey,
      looking from the face of her terrible sister-in-law to that of Thuillier,
      consulting each countenance, and oblivious of herself; but joy on the face
      of that poor helot, accustomed to be nothing, to repress her ideas, her
      feelings, had the effect of a pale wintry sun behind a mist; it barely
      lighted her faded, flabby flesh. The gauze cap trimmed with dingy flowers,
      the hair ill-dressed, the gloomy brown gown, with no ornament but a thick
      gold chain&mdash;all, combined with the expression of her countenance,
      stimulated the affection of the young Celeste, who&mdash;alone in the
      world&mdash;knew the value of that woman condemned to silence but aware of
      all about her, suffering from all yet consoling herself in God and in the
      girl who now was watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let the dear child give us her little toast,&rdquo; said la Peyrade to
      Madame Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my daughter,&rdquo; cried Colleville; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the hermitage still to be
      drunk&mdash;and it&rsquo;s hoary with age,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my kind godmother!&rdquo; said the girl, lowering her glass respectfully
      before Madame Thuillier, and holding it towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman, startled, looked through a veil of tears first at her
      husband, and then at Brigitte; but her position in the family was so well
      known, and the homage paid by innocence to weakness had something so
      beautiful about it, that the emotion was general; the men all rose and
      bowed to Madame Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Celeste, I would I had a kingdom to lay at your feet,&rdquo; murmured Felix
      Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Phellion wiped away a tear. Dutocq himself was moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the charming child!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle Thuillier, rising, and going
      round to kiss her sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My turn now!&rdquo; said Colleville, posing like an athlete. &ldquo;Now listen: To
      friendship! Empty your glasses; refill your glasses. Good! To the fine
      arts,&mdash;the flower of social life! Empty your glasses; refill your
      glasses. To another such festival on the day after election!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that little bottle you have there?&rdquo; said Dutocq to Mademoiselle
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is one of my three bottles of Madame Amphoux&rsquo; liqueur;
      the second is for the day of Celeste&rsquo;s marriage; the third for the day on
      which her first child is baptized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is losing her head,&rdquo; remarked Thuillier to Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner ended with a toast, offered by Thuillier, but suggested to him
      by Theodose at the moment when the malaga sparkled in the little glasses
      like so many rubies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colleville, messieurs, has drunk to <i>friendship</i>. I now drink, in
      this most generous wine, To my friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hurrah, full of heartiness, greeted that fine sentiment, but Dutocq
      remarked aside to Theodose:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame to pour such wine down the throats of such people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if we could only make such wine as that!&rdquo; cried Zelie, making her
      glass ring by the way in which she sucked down the Spanish liquid. &ldquo;What
      fortunes we could get!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zelie had now reached her highest point of incandescence, and was really
      alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Minard, &ldquo;but ours is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, sister,&rdquo; said Brigitte to Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;that we had
      better take coffee in the salon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Thuillier obediently assumed the air of mistress of the house, and
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are a great wizard,&rdquo; said Flavie Colleville, accepting la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s arm to return to the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I care only to bewitch you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I think you more
      enchanting than ever this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier,&rdquo; she said, to evade the subject, &ldquo;Thuillier made to think
      himself a political character! oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Flavie, half the absurdities of life are the result of such
      conspiracies; and men are not alone in these deceptions. In how many
      families one sees the husband, children, and friends persuading a silly
      mother that she is a woman of sense, or an old woman of fifty that she is
      young and beautiful. Hence, inconceivable contrarieties for those who go
      about the world with their eyes shut. One man owes his ill-savored conceit
      to the flattery of a mistress; another owes his versifying vanity to those
      who are paid to call him a great poet. Every family has its great man; and
      the result is, as we see it in the Chamber, general obscurity of the
      lights of France. Well, men of real mind are laughing to themselves about
      it, that&rsquo;s all. You are the mind and the beauty of this little circle of
      the petty bourgeoisie; it is this superiority which led me in the first
      instance to worship you. I have since longed to drag you out of it; for I
      love you sincerely&mdash;more in friendship than in love; though a great
      deal of love is gliding into it,&rdquo; he added, pressing her to his heart
      under cover of the recess of a window to which he had taken her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Phellion will play the piano,&rdquo; cried Colleville. &ldquo;We must all
      dance to-night&mdash;bottles and Brigitte&rsquo;s francs and all the little
      girls! I&rsquo;ll go and fetch my clarionet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave his empty coffee-cup to his wife, smiling to see her so friendly
      with la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you said and done to my husband?&rdquo; asked Flavie, when Colleville
      had left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I tell you all our secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t love me,&rdquo; she replied, looking at him with the coquettish
      slyness of a woman who is not quite decided in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you tell me yours,&rdquo; he said, letting himself go to the lively
      impulse of Provencal gaiety, always so charming and apparently so natural,
      &ldquo;I will not conceal from you an anxiety in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her back to the same window and said, smiling:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colleville, poor man, has seen in me the artist repressed by all these
      bourgeois; silent before them because I feel misjudged, misunderstood, and
      repelled by them. He has felt the heat of the sacred fire that consumes
      me. Yes I am,&rdquo; he continued, in a tone of conviction, &ldquo;an artist in words
      after the manner of Berryer; I could make juries weep, by weeping myself,
      for I&rsquo;m as nervous as a woman. Your husband, who detests the bourgeoisie,
      began to tease me about them. At first we laughed; then, in becoming
      serious, he found out that I was as strong as he. I told him of the plan
      concocted to make <i>something</i> of Thuillier, and I showed him all the
      good he could get himself out of a political puppet. &lsquo;If it were only,&rsquo; I
      said to him, &lsquo;to make yourself Monsieur <i>de</i> Colleville, and to put
      your charming wife where I should like to see her, as the wife of a
      receiver-general, or deputy. To make yourself all that you and she ought
      to be, you have only to go and live a few years in the Upper or Lower
      Alps, in some hole of a town where everybody will like you, and your wife
      will seduce everybody; and this,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;you cannot fail to obtain,
      especially if you give your dear Celeste to some man who can influence the
      Chamber.&rsquo; Good reasons, stated in jest, have the merit of penetrating
      deeper into some minds than if they were given soberly. So Colleville and
      I became the best friends in the world. Didn&rsquo;t you hear him say to me at
      table, &lsquo;Rascal! you have stolen my speech&rsquo;? To-night we shall be theeing
      and thouing each other. I intend to have a choice little supper-party
      soon, where artists, tied to the proprieties at home, always compromise
      themselves. I&rsquo;ll invite him, and that will make us as solidly good friends
      as he is with Thuillier. There, my dear adorned one, is what a profound
      sentiment gives a man the courage to produce. Colleville must adopt me; so
      that I may visit your house by his invitation. But what couldn&rsquo;t you make
      me do? lick lepers, swallow live toads, seduce Brigitte&mdash;yes, if you
      say so, I&rsquo;ll impale my own heart on that great picket-rail to please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frightened me this morning,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this evening you are reassured. Yes,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;no harm will ever
      happen to you through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, I must acknowledge, a most extraordinary man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no! the smallest as well as the greatest of my efforts are merely
      the reflections of the flame which you have kindled. I intend to be your
      son-in-law that we may never part. My wife, heavens! what could she be to
      me but a machine for child-bearing? whereas the divinity, the sublime
      being will be&mdash;you,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Satan!&rdquo; she said, in a sort of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am something of a poet, like all the men of my region. Come, be my
      Josephine! I&rsquo;ll go and see you to-morrow. I have the most ardent desire to
      see where you live and how you live, the furniture you use, the color of
      your stuffs, the arrangement of all things about you. I long to see the
      pearl in its shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped away cleverly after these words, without waiting for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavie, to whom in all her life love had never taken the language of
      romance, sat still, but happy, her heart palpitating, and saying to
      herself that it was very difficult to escape such influence. For the first
      time Theodose had appeared in a pair of new trousers, with gray silk
      stockings and pumps, a waistcoat of black silk, and a cravat of black
      satin on the knot of which shone a plain gold pin selected with taste. He
      wore also a new coat in the last fashion, and yellow gloves, relieved by
      white shirt-cuffs; he was the only man who had manners, or deportment in
      that salon, which was now filling up for the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Pron, nee Barniol, arrived with two school-girls, aged seventeen,
      confided to her maternal care by families residing in Martinique. Monsieur
      Pron, professor of rhetoric in a college presided over by priests,
      belonged to the Phellion class; but, instead of expanding on the surface
      in phrases and demonstrations, and posing as an example, he was dry and
      sententious. Monsieur and Madame Pron, the flowers of the Phellion salon,
      received every Monday. Though a professor, the little man danced. He
      enjoyed great influence in the quarter enclosed by the boulevard du
      Mont-Parnasse, the Luxembourg, and the rue de Sevres. Therefore, as soon
      as Phellion saw his friend, he took him by the arm into a corner to inform
      him of the Thuillier candidacy. After ten minutes&rsquo; consultation they both
      went to find Thuillier, and the recess of a window, opposite to that where
      Flavie still sat absorbed in her reflections, no doubt, heard a &ldquo;trio&rdquo;
       worthy, in its way, of that of the Swiss in &ldquo;Guillaume Tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see,&rdquo; said Theodose, returning to Flavie, &ldquo;the pure and honest
      Phellion intriguing over there? Give a personal reason to a virtuous man
      and he&rsquo;ll paddle in the slimiest puddle; he is hooking that little Pron,
      and Pron is taking it all in, solely to get your little Celeste for Felix
      Phellion. Separate them, and in ten minutes they&rsquo;ll get together again,
      and that young Minard will be growling round them like an angry bulldog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, still under the strong emotion imparted to him by Celeste&rsquo;s
      generous action and the cry that came from the girl&rsquo;s heart, though no one
      but Madame Thuillier still thought of it, became inspired by one of those
      ingenuous artfulnesses which are the honest charlatanism of true love; but
      he was not to the manner born of it, and mathematics, moreover, made him
      somewhat absent-minded. He stationed himself near Madame Thuillier,
      imagining that Madame Thuillier would attract Celeste to her side. This
      astute calculation succeeded all the better because young Minard, who saw
      in Celeste nothing more than a &ldquo;dot,&rdquo; had no such sudden inspiration, and
      was drinking his coffee and talking politics with Laudigeois, Monsieur
      Barniol, and Dutocq by order of his father, who was thinking and planning
      for the general election of the legislature in 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t love Celeste?&rdquo; said Felix to Madame Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little darling, no one in the world loves me as she does,&rdquo; replied the
      poor slave, with difficulty restraining her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame, we both love you,&rdquo; said the candid professor, sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying to each other?&rdquo; asked Celeste, coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said the pious woman, drawing her god-daughter down to her and
      kissing her on the forehead. &ldquo;He said that you both loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be angry with my presumption, mademoiselle. Let me do all I can to
      prove it,&rdquo; murmured Felix. &ldquo;Ah! I cannot help it, I was made this way;
      injustice revolts me to the soul! Yes, the Saviour of men was right to
      promise the future to the meek heart, to the slain lamb! A man who did not
      love you, Celeste, must have adored you after that sublime impulse of
      yours at table. Ah, yes! innocence alone can console the martyr. You are a
      kind young girl; you will be one of those wives who make the glory and the
      happiness of a family. Happy be he whom you will choose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godmamma, with what eyes do you think Monsieur Felix sees me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appreciates you, my little angel; I shall pray to God for both of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew how happy I am that my father can do a service to Monsieur
      Thuillier, and how I wish I could be useful to your brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Celeste, laughing, &ldquo;you love us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; replied Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      True love wraps itself in the mysteries of reserve, even in its
      expression; it proves itself by itself; it does not feel the necessity, as
      a false love does, of lighting a conflagration. By an observer (if such a
      being could have glided into the Thuillier salon) a book might have been
      made in comparing the two scenes of love-making, and in watching the
      enormous preparations of Theodose and the simplicity of Felix: one was
      nature, the other was society,&mdash;the true and the false embodied.
      Noticing her daughter glowing with happiness, exhaling her soul through
      the pores of her face, and beautiful with the beauty of a young girl
      gathering the first roses of an indirect declaration, Flavie had an
      impulse of jealousy in her heart. She came across to Celeste and said in
      her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not behaving well, my daughter; everybody is observing you; you
      are compromising yourself by talking so long to Monsieur Felix without
      knowing whether we approve of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma, my godmother is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! pardon me, dear friend,&rdquo; said Madame Colleville; &ldquo;I did not notice
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do as others do,&rdquo; said the poor nonentity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That reply stung Madame Colleville, who regarded it as a barbed arrow. She
      cast a haughty glance at Felix and said to Celeste, &ldquo;Sit there, my
      daughter,&rdquo; seating herself at the same time beside Madame Thuillier and
      pointing to a chair on the other side of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will work myself to death,&rdquo; said Felix to Madame Thuillier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a
      member of the Academy of Sciences; I&rsquo;ll make some great discovery, and win
      her hand by force of fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought the poor woman to herself, &ldquo;I ought to have had a gentle,
      peaceful, learned man like that. I might have slowly developed in a life
      of quietness. It was not thy will, O God! but, I pray thee, unite and
      bless these children; they are made for one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she sat there, pensive, listening to the racket made by her
      sister-in-law&mdash;a ten-horse power at work&mdash;who now, lending a
      hand to her two servants, cleared the table, taking everything out of the
      dining-room to accommodate the dancers, vociferating, like the captain of
      a frigate on his quarter-deck when taking his ship into action: &ldquo;Have you
      plenty of raspberry syrup?&rdquo; &ldquo;Run out and buy some more orgeat!&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      not enough glasses. Where&rsquo;s the &lsquo;eau rougie&rsquo;? Take those six bottles of
      &lsquo;vin ordinaire&rsquo; and make more. Mind that Coffinet, the porter, doesn&rsquo;t get
      any.&rdquo; &ldquo;Caroline, my girl, you are to wait at the sideboard; you&rsquo;ll have
      tongue and ham to slice in case they dance till morning. But mind, no
      waste! Keep an eye on everything. Pass me the broom; put more oil in those
      lamps; don&rsquo;t make blunders. Arrange the remains of the dessert so as to
      make a show on the sideboard; ask my sister to come and help us. I&rsquo;m sure
      I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s thinking about, that dawdle! Heavens, how slow she
      is! Here, take away these chairs, they&rsquo;ll want all the room they can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The salon was full of Barniols, Collevilles, Phellions, Laudigeois, and
      many others whom the announcement of a dance at the Thuilliers&rsquo;, spread
      about in the Luxembourg between two and four in the afternoon, the hour at
      which the bourgeoisie takes its walk, had drawn thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Brigitte?&rdquo; said Colleville, bolting into the dining-room;
      &ldquo;it is nine o&rsquo;clock, and they are packed as close as herrings in the
      salon. Cardot, his wife and son and daughter and future son-in-law have
      just come, accompanied by that young Vinet; the whole faubourg Saint
      Antoine is debouching. Can&rsquo;t we move the piano in here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave the signal, by tuning his clarionet, the joyous sounds of
      which were greeted with huzzas from the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to describe a ball of this kind. The toilets, faces, and
      conversations were all in keeping with one fact which will surely suffice
      even the dullest imagination; they passed round, on tarnished and
      discolored trays, common tumblers filled with wine, &ldquo;eau rougie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;eau
      sucree.&rdquo; The trays on which were glasses of orgeat and glasses of syrup
      and water appeared only at long intervals. There were five card-tables and
      twenty-five players, and eighteen dancers of both sexes. At one o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning, all present&mdash;Madame Thuillier, Mademoiselle Brigitte,
      Madame Phellion, even Phellion himself&mdash;were dragged into the
      vivacities of a country-dance, vulgarly called &ldquo;La Boulangere,&rdquo; in which
      Dutocq figured with a veil over his head, after the manner of the Kabyl.
      The servants who were waiting to escort their masters home, and those of
      the household, were audience to this performance; and after the
      interminable dance had lasted one whole hour it was proposed to carry
      Brigitte in triumph when she gave the announcement that supper was served.
      This circumstance made her see the necessity of hiding a dozen bottles of
      old burgundy. In short, the company had amused themselves so well, the
      matrons as well as the young girls, that Thuillier found occasion to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, this morning we little thought we should have such a fete
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never more pleasure,&rdquo; said the notary Cardot, &ldquo;than in just such
      improvised balls. Don&rsquo;t talk to me of parties where everybody stands on
      ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This opinion, we may remark, is a standing axiom among the bourgeoisie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said Madame Minard, &ldquo;I prefer the dignified old
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean that for you, madame; your salon is the chosen haunt of
      pleasure,&rdquo; said Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      When &ldquo;La Boulangere&rdquo; came to an end, Theodose pulled Dutocq from the
      sideboard where he was preparing to eat a slice of tongue, and said to
      him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go; we must be at Cerizet&rsquo;s very early in the morning; we ought
      both of us to think over that affair; it is not so easy to manage as
      Cerizet seems to imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Dutocq, bringing his slice of tongue to eat in the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know enough of it to be aware of the dangers of the affair. If that
      notary wants the house and we filch it from him, there are means by which
      he can recover it; he can put himself into the skin of a registered
      creditor. By the present legal system relating to mortgages, when a house
      is sold at the request of creditors, if the price obtained for it at
      auction is not enough to pay all debts, the owners have the right to bid
      it in and hold it for a higher sum; now the notary, seeing himself caught,
      may back out of the sale in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;it needs attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Dutocq, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go and see Cerizet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, &ldquo;go and see Cerizet,&rdquo; were overheard by Minard, who was
      following the two associates; but they offered no meaning to his mind. The
      two men were so outside of his own course and projects that he heard them
      without listening to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has been one of the finest days in our lives,&rdquo; said Brigitte to her
      brother, when she found herself alone with him in the deserted salon, at
      half-past two in the morning. &ldquo;What a distinction! to be thus selected by
      your fellow-citizens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mistaken about it, Brigitte; we owe it all, my child, to one
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To our friend, la Peyrade.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX. THE BANKER OF THE POOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not on the next day, Monday, but on the following day, Tuesday,
      that Dutocq and Theodose went to see Cerizet, the former having called la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s attention to the fact that Cerizet always absented himself on
      Sundays and Mondays, taking advantage of the total absence of clients on
      those days, which are devoted by the populace to debauch. The house toward
      which they directed their steps is one of the striking features in the
      faubourg Saint-Jacques, and it is quite as important to study it here as
      it was to study those of Phellion and Thuillier. It is not known (true, no
      commission has yet been appointed to examine this phenomenon), no one
      knows why certain quarters become degraded and vulgarized, morally as well
      as materially; why, for instance, the ancient residence of the court and
      the church, the Luxembourg and the Latin quarter, have become what they
      are to-day, in spite of the presence of the finest palaces in the world,
      in spite of the bold cupola of Sainte-Genevieve, that of Mansard on the
      Val-de-Grace, and the charms of the Jardin des Plantes. One asks one&rsquo;s
      self why the elegance of life has left that region; why the Vauquer
      houses, the Phellion and the Thuillier houses now swarm with tenants and
      boarders, on the site of so many noble and religious buildings, and why
      such mud and dirty trades and poverty should have fastened on a hilly
      piece of ground, instead of spreading out upon the flat land beyond the
      confines of the ancient city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angel whose beneficence once hovered above this quarter being dead,
      usury, on the lowest scale, rushed in and took his place. To the old
      judge, Popinot, succeeded Cerizet; and strange to say,&mdash;a fact which
      it is well to study,&mdash;the effect produced, socially speaking, was
      much the same. Popinot loaned money without interest, and was willing to
      lose; Cerizet lost nothing, and compelled the poor to work hard and stay
      virtuous. The poor adored Popinot, but they did not hate Cerizet. Here, in
      this region, revolves the lowest wheel of Parisian financiering. At the
      top, Nucingen &amp; Co., the Kellers, du Tillet, and the Mongenods; a
      little lower down, the Palmas, Gigonnets, and Gobsecks; lower still, the
      Samonons, Chaboisseaus, and Barbets; and lastly (after the pawn-shops)
      comes this king of usury, who spreads his nets at the corners of the
      streets to entangle all miseries and miss none,&mdash;Cerizet, &ldquo;money
      lender by the little week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frogged frock-coat will have prepared you for the den in which this
      convicted stock-broker carried on his present business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was humid with saltpetre; the walls, sweating moisture, were
      enamelled all over with large slabs of mould. Standing at the corner of
      the rue des Postes and rue des Poules, it presented first a ground-floor,
      occupied partly by a shop for the sale of the commonest kind of wine,
      painted a coarse bright red, decorated with curtains of red calico,
      furnished with a leaden counter, and guarded by formidable iron bars.
      Above the gate of an odious alley hung a frightful lantern, on which were
      the words &ldquo;Night lodgings here.&rdquo; The outer walls were covered with iron
      crossbars, showing, apparently, the insecurity of the building, which was
      owned by the wine-merchant, who also inhabited the entresol. The widow
      Poiret (nee Michonneau) kept furnished lodgings on the first, second, and
      third floors, consisting of single rooms for workmen and for the poorest
      class of students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet occupied one room on the ground-floor and another in the entresol,
      to which he mounted by an interior staircase; this entresol looked out
      upon a horrible paved court, from which arose mephitic odors. Cerizet paid
      forty francs a month to the widow Poiret for his breakfast and dinner; he
      thus conciliated her by becoming her boarder; he also made himself
      acceptable to the wine-merchant by procuring him an immense sale of wine
      and liquors among his clients&mdash;profits realized before sunrise; the
      wine-shop beginning operations about three in the morning in summer, and
      five in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of the great Market, which so many of his clients, male and
      female, attended, was the determining cause of Cerizet&rsquo;s early hours. The
      Sieur Cadenet, the wine-merchant, in view of the custom which he owed to
      the usurer, had let him the two rooms for the low price of eighty francs a
      year, and had given him a lease for twelve years, which Cerizet alone had
      a right to break, without paying indemnity, at three months&rsquo; notice.
      Cadenet always carried in a bottle of excellent wine for the dinner of
      this useful tenant; and when Cerizet was short of money he had only to say
      to his friend, &ldquo;Cadenet, lend me a few hundred francs,&rdquo;&mdash;loans which
      he faithfully repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cadenet, it was said, had proof of the widow Poiret having deposited in
      Cerizet&rsquo;s hands some two thousand francs for investment, which may explain
      the progress of the latter&rsquo;s affairs since the day when he first took up
      his abode in the quarter, supplied with a last note of a thousand francs
      and Dutocq&rsquo;s protection. Cadenet, prompted by a cupidity which success
      increased, had proposed, early in the year, to put twenty thousand francs
      into the hands of his friend Cerizet. But Cerizet had positively declined
      them, on the ground that he ran risks of a nature to become a possible
      cause of dispute with associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could only,&rdquo; he said to Cadenet, &ldquo;take them at six per cent interest,
      and you can do better than that in your own business. We will go into
      partnership later, if you like, in some serious enterprise, some good
      opportunity which may require, say, fifty thousand francs. When you have
      got that sum to invest, let me know, and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had only suggested the affair of the house to Theodose after
      making sure that among the three, Madame Poiret, Cadenet, and himself, it
      was impossible to raise the full sum of one hundred thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;lender by the little week&rdquo; was thus in perfect safety in his den,
      where he could even, if necessity came, appeal to the law. On certain
      mornings there might be seen as many as sixty or eighty persons, men as
      often as women, either in the wine-shop, or the alley, or sitting on the
      staircase, for the distrustful Cerizet would only admit six persons at a
      time into his office. The first comers were first served, and each had to
      go by his number, which the wine-merchant, or his shop-boy, affixed to the
      hats of the man and the backs of the women. Sometimes the clients would
      sell to each other (as hackney-coachmen do on the cabstands), head numbers
      for tail numbers. On certain days, when the market business was pressing,
      a head number was often sold for a glass of brandy and a sou. The numbers,
      as they issued from Cerizet&rsquo;s office, called up the succeeding numbers;
      and if any disputes arose Cadenet put a stop to the fray at once my
      remarking:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get the police here you won&rsquo;t gain anything; <i>he</i>&rsquo;ll shut up
      shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      HE was Cerizet&rsquo;s name. When, in the course of the day, some hapless woman,
      without an atom of food in her room, and seeing her children pale with
      hunger, would come to borrow ten or twenty sous, she would say to the
      wine-merchant anxiously:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is <i>he</i> there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cadenet, a short, stout man, dressed in blue, with outer sleeves of black
      stuff and a wine-merchant&rsquo;s apron, and always wearing a cap, seemed an
      angel to these mothers when he replied to them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> told me that you were an honest woman and I might give you
      forty sous. You know what you must do about it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, strange to say, <i>he</i> was blessed by these poor people, even as
      they had lately blessed Popinot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cerizet was cursed on Sunday mornings when accounts were settled; and
      they cursed him even more on Saturdays, when it was necessary to work in
      order to repay the sum borrowed with interest. But, after all, he was
      Providence, he was God from Tuesday to Friday of every week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room which he made his office, formerly the kitchen of the next floor,
      was bare; the beams of the ceiling had been whitewashed, but still bore
      marks of smoke. The walls, along which he had put benches, and the stone
      floor, retained and gave out dampness. The fireplace, where the crane
      remained, was partly filled by an iron stove in which Cerizet burned
      sea-coal when the weather was severe. A platform about half a foot high
      and eight feet square extended from the edge of the fireplace; on it was
      fastened a common table and an armchair with a round cushion covered with
      green leather. Behind him, Cerizet had sheathed the walls with planks;
      also protecting himself with a little wooden screen, painted white, from
      the draught between the window and door; but this screen, made of two
      leaves, was so placed that the warmth from the stove reached him. The
      window had enormous inside shutters of cast-iron, held, when closed, by a
      bar. The door commanded respect by an armor of the same character.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end of this room, in a corner, was a spiral-staircase,
      coming, evidently, from some pulled-down shop, and bought in the rue
      Chapon by Cadenet, who had fitted it through the ceiling into the room in
      the entresol occupied by Cerizet. In order to prevent all communication
      with the upper floors, Cerizet had exacted that the door of that room
      which opened on the common landing should be walled up. The place had thus
      become a fortress. The bedroom above had a cheap carpet bought for twenty
      francs, an iron bedstead, a bureau, three chairs, and an iron safe, made
      by a good workman, which Cerizet had bought at a bargain. He shaved before
      a glass on the chimney-piece; he owned two pairs of cotton sheets and six
      cotton shirts; the rest of his visible wardrobe was of the same character.
      Cadenet had once seen Cerizet dressed like a dandy of the period; he must,
      therefore, have kept hidden, in some drawer of his bureau, a complete
      disguise with which he could go to the opera, see the world, and not be
      recognized, for, had it not been that Cadenet heard his voice, he would
      certainly have asked him who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      What pleased the clients of this man most was his joviality and his
      repartees; he talked their language. Cadenet, his two shop-men, and
      Cerizet, living in the midst of dreadful misery, behaved with the calmness
      of undertakers in presence of afflicted heirs, of old sergeants of the
      Guard among heaps of dead. They no more shuddered on hearing cries of
      hunger and despair than surgeons shudder at the cries of their patients in
      hospital; they said, as the soldiers and the dressers said, the
      perfunctory words, &ldquo;Have patience! a little courage! What&rsquo;s the good of
      grieving? Suppose you kill yourself, what then? One gets accustomed to
      everything; be reasonable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Cerizet took the precaution to hide the money necessary for his
      morning operations in the hollow seat of the chair in which he sat, taking
      out no more than a hundred francs at a time, which he put in the pockets
      of his trousers, never dipping into the funds of the chair except between
      the entrance of two batches of clients (keeping his door locked and not
      opening it till all was safely stowed in his pockets), he had really
      nothing to fear from the various despairs which found their way from all
      sides to this rendezvous of misery. Certainly, there are many different
      ways of being honest and virtuous; and the &ldquo;Monograph of Virtue&rdquo; has no
      other basis than this social axiom.[*] A man is false to his conscience;
      he fails, apparently, in delicacy; he forfeits that bloom of honor which,
      though lost, does not, as yet, mean general disrepute; at last, however,
      he fails decidedly in honor; if he falls into the hands of the
      correctional police, he is not, as yet, guilty of crime before the court
      of assizes; but after he is branded with infamy by the verdict of a jury
      he may still be honored at the galleys for the species of honor and
      integrity practised by criminals among themselves, which consists in not
      betraying each other, in sharing booty loyally, and in running all
      dangers. Well, this last form of honor&mdash;which is perhaps a
      calculation, a necessity, the practice of which offers certain
      opportunities for grandeur to the guilty man and the possibility of a
      return to good&mdash;reigned absolutely between Cerizet and his clients.
      Never did Cerizet make an error, nor his poor people either; neither side
      ever denied what was due, either capital or interests. Many a time
      Cerizet, who was born among the people, corrected from one week to another
      some accidental error, to the benefit of a poor man who had never
      discovered it. He was called a Jew, but an honest one, and his word in
      that city of sorrows was sacred. A woman died, causing a loss to him of
      thirty francs:

    <p>
      &ldquo;See my profits! there they go!&rdquo; he said to his assemblage, &ldquo;and you howl
      upon me! You know I&rsquo;ll never trouble the brats; in fact, Cadenet has
      already taken them bread and heel-taps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that it was said of him in both faubourgs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not a bad fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;loan by the little week,&rdquo; as interpreted by Cerizet, is not,
      considering all things, so cruel a thing as the pawn-shop. Cerizet loaned
      ten francs Tuesday on condition of receiving twelve francs Sunday morning.
      In five weeks he doubled his capital; but he had to make many compromises.
      His kindness consisted in accepting, from time to time, eleven francs and
      fifty centimes; sometimes the whole interest was still owing. When he gave
      fifty francs for sixty to a fruit-stall man, or a hundred francs for one
      hundred and twenty to a seller of peat-fuel, he ran great risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the rue des Poules through the rue des Postes, Theodose and
      Dutocq saw a great assemblage of men and women, and by the light which the
      wine-merchant&rsquo;s little oil-lamps cast upon these groups, they were
      horrified at beholding that mass of red, seamed, haggard faces; solemn
      with suffering, withered, distorted, swollen with wine, pallid from
      liquor; some threatening, others resigned, some sarcastic or jeering,
      others besotted; all rising from the midst of those terrible rags, which
      no designer can surpass in his most extravagant caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be recognized,&rdquo; said Theodose, pulling Dutocq away; &ldquo;we have done
      a foolish thing to come here at this hour and take him in the midst of his
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more that Claparon may be sleeping in his lair, the interior of
      which we know nothing about. Yes, there are dangers for you, but none for
      me; I shall be thought to have business with my copying-clerk, and I&rsquo;ll go
      and tell him to come and dine with us; this is court day, so we can&rsquo;t have
      him to breakfast. I&rsquo;ll tell him to meet us at the &lsquo;Chaumiere&rsquo; in one of
      the garden dining-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad; anybody could listen to us there without being seen,&rdquo; said la
      Peyrade. &ldquo;I prefer the &lsquo;Petit Rocher de Cancale&rsquo;; we can go into a private
      room and speak low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you are seen with Cerizet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s go to the &lsquo;Cheval Rouge,&rsquo; quai de la Tournelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s best; seven o&rsquo;clock; nobody will be there then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dutocq advanced alone into the midst of that congress of beggars, and he
      heard his own name repeated from mouth to mouth, for he could hardly fail
      to encounter among them some jail-bird familiar with the judge&rsquo;s office,
      just as Theodose was certain to have met a client.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these quarters the justice-of-peace is the supreme authority; all legal
      contests stop short at his office, especially since the law was passed
      giving to those judges sovereign power in all cases of litigation
      involving not over one hundred and forty francs. A way was made for the
      judge&rsquo;s clerk, who was not less feared than the judge himself. He saw
      women seated on the staircase; a horrible display of pallor and suffering
      of many kinds. Dutocq was almost asphyxiated when he opened the door of
      the room in which already sixty persons had left their odors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your number? your number?&rdquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your jaw!&rdquo; cried a gruff voice from the street, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the pen of
      the judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Profound silence followed. Dutocq found his copying clerk clothed in a
      jacket of yellow leather like that of the gloves of the gendarmerie,
      beneath which he wore an ignoble waistcoat of knitted wool. The reader
      must imagine the man&rsquo;s diseased head issuing from this species of scabbard
      and covered with a miserable Madras handkerchief, which, leaving to view
      the forehead and neck, gave to that head, by the gleam of a tallow candle
      of twelve to the pound, its naturally hideous and threatening character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done that way, papa Lantimeche,&rdquo; Cerizet was saying to a tall
      old man, seeming to be about seventy years of age, who was standing before
      him with a red woollen cap in his hand, exhibiting a bald head, and a
      breast covered with white hairs visible through his miserable linen
      jacket. &ldquo;Tell me exactly what you want to undertake. One hundred francs,
      even on condition of getting back one hundred and twenty, can&rsquo;t be let
      loose that way, like a dog in a church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The five other applicants, among whom were two women, both with infants,
      one knitting, the other suckling her child, burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cerizet saw Dutocq, he rose respectfully and went rather hastily to
      meet him, adding to his client:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take time to reflect; for, don&rsquo;t you see? it makes me doubtful to have
      such a sum as that, one hundred francs! asked for by an old journeyman
      locksmith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you it concerns an invention,&rdquo; cried the old workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An invention and one hundred francs!&rdquo; said Dutocq. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the
      laws; you must take out a patent, and that costs two thousand francs, and
      you want influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is true,&rdquo; said Cerizet, who, however, reckoned a good deal on
      such chances. &ldquo;Come to-morrow morning, papa Lantimeche, at six o&rsquo;clock,
      and we&rsquo;ll talk it over; you can&rsquo;t talk inventions in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet then turned to Dutocq whose first words were:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the thing turns out well, half profits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you get up at this time in the morning to come here and say that
      to me?&rdquo; demanded the distrustful Cerizet, already displeased with the
      mention of &ldquo;half profits.&rdquo; &ldquo;You could have seen me as usual at the
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he looked askance at Dutocq; the latter, while telling him his errand
      and speaking of Claparon and the necessity of pushing forward in the
      Theodose affair, seemed confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same you could have seen me this morning at the office,&rdquo; repeated
      Cerizet, conducting his visitor to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; thought he, as he returned to his seat, &ldquo;who seems to me
      to have breathed on his lantern so that I may not see clear. Well, well,
      I&rsquo;ll give up that place of copying clerk. Ha! your turn, little mother!&rdquo;
       he cried; &ldquo;you invent children! That&rsquo;s amusing enough, though the trick is
      well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is all the more useless to relate the conversation which took place
      between the three confederates at the &ldquo;Cheval Rouge,&rdquo; because the
      arrangements there concluded were the basis of certain confidences made,
      as we shall see, by Theodose to Mademoiselle Thuillier; but it is
      necessary to remark that the cleverness displayed by la Peyrade seemed
      almost alarming to Cerizet and Dutocq. After this conference, the banker
      of the poor, finding himself in company with such powerful players, had it
      in mind to make sure of his own stake at the first chance. To win the game
      at any price over the heads of the ablest gamblers, by cheating if
      necessary, is the inspiration of a special sort of vanity peculiar to
      friends of the green cloth. Hence came the terrible blow which la Peyrade
      was about to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew his two associates well; and therefore, in spite of the perpetual
      activity of his intellectual forces, in spite of the perpetual
      watchfulness his personality of ten faces required, nothing fatigued him
      as much as the part he had to play with his two accomplices. Dutocq was a
      great knave, and Cerizet had once been a comic actor; they were both
      experts in humbug. A motionless face like Talleyrand&rsquo;s would have made
      then break at once with the Provencal, who was now in their clutches; it
      was necessary, therefore, that he should make a show of ease and
      confidence and of playing above board&mdash;the very height of art in such
      affairs. To delude the pit is an every-day triumph, but to deceive
      Mademoiselle Mars, Frederic Lemaitre, Potier, Talma, Monrose, is the acme
      of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conference at the &ldquo;Cheval Rouge&rdquo; had therefore the result of giving
      to la Peyrade, who was fully as sagacious as Cerizet, a secret fear,
      which, during the latter period of this daring game, so fired his blood
      and heated his brain that there came moments when he fell into the morbid
      condition of the gambler, who follows with his eye the roll of the ball on
      which he has staked his last penny. The senses then have a lucidity in
      their action and the mind takes a range, which human knowledge has no
      means of measuring.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. HOW BRIGITTE WAS WON
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after this conference at the &ldquo;Cheval Rouge,&rdquo; la Peyrade went to
      dine with the Thuilliers, and on the commonplace pretext of a visit to
      pay, Thuillier carried off his wife, leaving Theodose alone with Brigitte.
      Neither Thuillier, nor his sister, nor Theodose, were the dupes of this
      comedy; but the old beau of the Empire considered the manoeuvre a piece of
      diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, do not take advantage of my sister&rsquo;s innocence; respect it,&rdquo;
       said Thuillier solemnly, as he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Theodose, drawing his chair closer to the sofa where
      Brigitte sat knitting, &ldquo;have you thought of inducing the business men of
      the arrondissement to support Thuillier&rsquo;s interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! you are in close relations with Barbet and Metivier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are right! Faith! you are no blunderer!&rdquo; she said after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we love our friends, we serve them,&rdquo; he replied, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      To capture Brigitte would be like carrying the redoubt of the Moskowa, the
      culminating strategic point. But it was necessary to possess that old maid
      as the devil was supposed in the middle ages to possess men, and in a way
      to make any awakening impossible for her. For the last three days la
      Peyrade had been measuring himself for the task; he had carefully
      reconnoitred the ground to see all difficulty. Flattery, that almost
      infallible means in able hands, would certainly miscarry with a woman who
      for years had known she had no beauty. But a man of strong will finds
      nothing impregnable; the Lamarques could never have failed to take Capri.
      Therefore, nothing must be omitted from the memorable scene which was now
      to take place; all things about it had their own importance,&mdash;inflections
      of the voice, pauses, glances, lowered eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; rejoined Brigitte, &ldquo;you have already proved to us your affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother has told you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he merely told me that you had something to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle, I have; for you are the man of the family. In
      reflecting on this matter, I find many dangers for myself, such as a man
      only risks for his nearest and dearest. It involves a fortune; thirty to
      forty thousand francs a year, and not the slightest speculation&mdash;a
      piece of landed property. The hope of helping Thuillier to win such a
      fortune enticed me from the first. &lsquo;It fascinates me,&rsquo; I said to him&mdash;for,
      unless a man is an absolute fool, he can&rsquo;t help asking himself: &lsquo;Why
      should he care to do us all this good?&rsquo; So I told him frankly that in
      working for his interests, I flattered myself I was working for my own, as
      I&rsquo;ll explain to you later. If he wishes to be deputy, two things are
      absolutely necessary: to comply with the law as to property, and to win
      for his name some sort of public celebrity. If I myself push my devotion
      to the point of helping him to write a book on public financiering&mdash;or
      anything else, no matter what&mdash;which would give him that celebrity, I
      ought also to think of the other matter, his property&mdash;it would be
      absurd to expect you to give him this house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my brother? Why, I&rsquo;d put it in his name to-morrow,&rdquo; cried Brigitte.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you thoroughly,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;but I do know things
      about you which now make me regret that I did not tell you the whole
      affair from its origin; I mean from the moment when I conceived the plan
      to which Thuillier will owe his nomination. He will be hunted down by envy
      and jealousy, and the task of upholding him will be a hard one; we must,
      however, get the better of his rivals and take the wind out of their
      sails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this affair,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;what are the difficulties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, the difficulties lie within my own conscience. Assuredly, I
      could not serve you in this matter without first consulting my confessor.
      From a worldly point of view&mdash;oh! the affair is perfectly legal, and
      I am&mdash;you&rsquo;ll understand me?&mdash;a barrister inscribed on the panel,
      that is, member of a bar controlled by the strictest rules. I am therefore
      incapable of proposing an enterprise which might give occasion for blame.
      In the first place, I myself don&rsquo;t make a penny by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte was on thorns; her face was flaming; she broke her wool, mended
      it, broke it again, and did not know which way to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t get,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in these days, forty thousand francs a year
      from landed property unless it is worth one million eight hundred
      thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will undertake that you shall see a piece of property and
      estimate yourself its probable revenue, which I can make Thuillier the
      owner of for fifty thousand francs down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you can make us obtain that!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, worked up to the
      highest excitement by the spur of her natural cupidity. &ldquo;Go on, my dear
      Monsieur Theodose, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, perhaps, have done yourself a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if Thuillier has told you my secret, I must leave this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you that I love Celeste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, on my word of honor!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, &ldquo;but I myself was just about to
      speak of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And offer her to me? Oh! may God forgive us! I can only win her of
      herself, her parents, by a free choice&mdash;No, no, all I ask of you is
      your good-will, your protection. Promise me, as Thuillier has, in return
      for my services your influence, your friendship; tell me that you will
      treat me as a son. If you will do that, I will abide by your decision in
      this matter; I can trust it; I need not speak to my confessor. For the
      last two years, ever since I have seen much of this family, to whom I
      would fain give my powers and devote my utmost energy&mdash;for, I shall
      succeed! surely I shall!&mdash;I have observed that your integrity, your
      honor is that of the olden time, your judgment righteous and inflexible.
      Also, you have a knowledge of business; and these qualities combined are
      precious helps to a man. With a mother-in-law, as I may say, of your
      powers, I should find my home life relieved of a crowd of cares and
      details as to property, which hinder a man&rsquo;s advance in a political career
      if he is forced to attend to them. I admired you deeply on Sunday evening.
      Ah! you were fine! How you did manage matters! In ten minutes that
      dining-room was cleared! And, without going outside of your own apartment,
      you had everything at hand for the refreshments, for the supper! &lsquo;There,&rsquo; 
      I said to myself, as I watched you, &lsquo;is a true &ldquo;maitresse-femme&rdquo;&mdash;a
      masterly woman!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte&rsquo;s nostrils dilated; she breathed in the words of the young
      lawyer. He gave her a side-long glance to enjoy his triumph; he had
      touched the right chord in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he was standing, but he now resumed his seat beside her,
      and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here is our affair, dear aunt&mdash;for you will be a sort of aunt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! you naughty fellow!&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;and go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the matter roughly&mdash;and remark, if you please, that I
      compromise myself in telling it to you; for these secrets are entrusted to
      me as a lawyer. Therefore understand that you and I are both committing a
      crime, so to speak, of leze-confidence! A notary of Paris was in
      partnership with an architect; they bought land and built upon it; at the
      present moment, property has come down with a rush; they find themselves
      embarrassed&mdash;but all that doesn&rsquo;t concern us. Among the houses built
      by this illegal partnership&mdash;for notaries, you know, are sworn to
      have nothing to do with enterprises&mdash;is a very good one which, not
      being finished, must be sold at a great sacrifice; so great that they now
      ask only one hundred thousand francs for it, although the cost of the land
      and the building was at least four hundred thousand. As the whole interior
      is still unfinished, the value of what is still to do is easily appraised;
      it will probably not be more than fifty thousand francs. Now, owing to its
      excellent position, this house, when finished, will certainly bring in a
      rental, over and above the taxes, of forty thousand francs a year. It is
      built of freestone, the corners and copings of cut granite; the facade is
      covered with handsome carvings, on which they spent more than twenty
      thousand francs; the windows are plate glass with a new style of fastening
      called &lsquo;cremona.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where is the difficulty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just here: the notary wants to reserve to himself this bit of the cake he
      is forced to surrender; he is, under the name of a friend, the creditor
      who requests the sale of the property by the assignee of the bankruptcy.
      The case has not been brought into court; for legal proceedings cost so
      much money. The sale is to be made by voluntary agreement. Now, this
      notary has applied to one of my clients to lend him his name for this
      purchase. My client, a poor devil, says to me: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a fortune to made
      out of that house by fooling the notary.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they do that sort of thing in business!&rdquo; said Brigitte, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that were the only difficulty,&rdquo; continued Theodose, &ldquo;it would be, as a
      friend of mine said to his pupil, who was complaining of the length of
      time it took to produce masterpieces in painting: &lsquo;My dear young fellow,
      if it were not so, our valets would be painting pictures.&rsquo; But,
      mademoiselle, if we now get the better of this notary, who certainly
      deserves it, for he has compromised a number of private fortunes, yet, as
      he is a very shrewd man (though a notary), it might perhaps be very
      difficult to do it a second time, and here&rsquo;s the rub: When a piece of
      landed property is bought at a forced sale, if those who have lent money
      on that property see that is likely to be sold so low as not to cover the
      sum loaned upon it, they have the right, until the expiration of a certain
      time, to bid it in; that is, to offer more and keep the property in their
      own hands. If this trickster can&rsquo;t be hoodwinked as to the sale being a
      bona fide one until the time when his right to buy it expires, some other
      scheme must be resorted to. Now, is this business strictly legal? Am I
      justified in doing it for the benefit of a family I seek to enter? That is
      the question I have been revolving in my mind for the last three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte, we must acknowledge, hesitated, and Theodose then brought
      forward his last card:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the night to think of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to-morrow we will talk it
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said Brigitte, looking at the lawyer with an almost
      loving air, &ldquo;the first thing to be done is to see the house. Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the Madeleine. That will be the heart of Paris in ten years. All
      that property has been desirable since 1819; the banker Du Tillet&rsquo;s
      fortune was derived from property about there. The famous failure of
      Maitre Roquin, which carried terror to all Paris, and did such harm to the
      confidence given to the notariat, was also caused by it; they went into
      heavy speculations on that land too soon; they should have waited until
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember about that,&rdquo; said Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house might be finished by the end of the year,&rdquo; continued Theodose,
      &ldquo;and the rentals could begin next spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could we go there to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear aunt, I am at your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call me that before people. As to this affair,&rdquo;
       she continued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have any opinion until I have seen the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has six storeys; nine windows on the front; a fine courtyard, four
      shops, and it stands on a corner. Ah! that notary knows what he is about
      in wishing to hold on to such pieces of property! But let political events
      interfere, and down go the Funds! If I were you, I should sell out all
      that you and Madame Thuillier have on the Grand Livre and buy this fine
      piece of real estate for Thuillier, and I&rsquo;d recover the fortune of that
      poor, pious creature by savings from its proceeds. Can the Funds go higher
      than they are to-day? One hundred and twenty-two! it is fabulous; I should
      make haste to sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte licked her lips; she perceived the means of keeping her own
      property intact, and of enriching her brother by this use of Madame
      Thuillier&rsquo;s fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is right,&rdquo; she said to Theodose; &ldquo;you certainly are a rare
      man; you&rsquo;ll get on in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll walk before me,&rdquo; responded Theodose with a naivete that touched
      the old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will live in the family,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be obstacles to that,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Madame Thuillier is very
      queer at times; she doesn&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I&rsquo;ll settle that,&rdquo; cried Brigitte. &ldquo;Do you attend to that affair and
      carry it through if it is feasible, and leave your interests in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier, member of the municipal council, owner of an estate with a
      rental of forty thousand francs a year, with the cross of the Legion of
      honor and the author of a political work, grave, serious, important, will
      be deputy at the forthcoming general election. But, between ourselves,
      little aunt, one couldn&rsquo;t devote one&rsquo;s self so utterly except for a
      father-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I have no fortune I shall have doubled yours; and if this affair
      goes through discreetly, others will turn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until I have seen the house,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Thuillier again, &ldquo;I can
      decide on nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, send for a carriage to-morrow and let us go there. I will get
      a ticket early in the morning to view the premises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then, about mid-day,&rdquo; responded Brigitte, holding out her hand
      to Theodose that he might shake it, but instead of that he laid upon it
      the most respectful and the most tender kiss that Brigitte had ever in her
      life received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, my child,&rdquo; she said, as he reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell hurriedly and when the servant came:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josephine,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;go at once to Madame Colleville, and ask her to
      come over and speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later Flavie entered the salon, where Brigitte was walking
      up and down, in a state of extreme agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she cried on seeing Flavie, &ldquo;you can do me a great service,
      which concerns our dear Celeste. You know Tullia, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;a
      danseuse at the opera; my brother was always dinning her into my ears at
      one time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know her; but she is no longer a danseuse; she is Madame la
      Comtesse du Bruel. Her husband is peer of France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she still like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never see each other now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know that Chaffaroux, the rich contractor, is her uncle,&rdquo; said
      Brigitte. &ldquo;He is old and wealthy. Go and see your former friend, and get
      her to give you a line of introduction to him, saying he would do her an
      eminent favor if he would give a piece of friendly advice to the bearer of
      the note, and then you and I will take it to him to-morrow about one
      o&rsquo;clock. But tell Tullia she must request her uncle to keep secret about
      it. Go, my dear. Celeste, our dear child, will be a millionaire! I can&rsquo;t
      say more; but she&rsquo;ll have, from me, a husband who will put her on a
      pinnacle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to tell you the first letters of his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T. P.,&mdash;Theodose de la Peyrade. You are right. That&rsquo;s a man who may,
      if supported by a woman like you, become a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is God himself who has placed him in our house!&rdquo; cried the old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Monsieur and Madame Thuillier returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days later, in the month of April, the ordinance which convoked the
      electors to appoint a member of the municipal council on the 20th of the
      same month was inserted in the &ldquo;Moniteur,&rdquo; and placarded about Paris. For
      several weeks the ministry, called that of March 1st, had been in power.
      Brigitte was in a charming humor. She had been convinced of the truth of
      all la Peyrade&rsquo;s assertions. The house, visited from garret to cellar by
      old Chaffaroux, was admitted by him to be an admirable construction; poor
      Grindot, the architect, who was interested with the notary and Claparon in
      the affair, thought the old man was employed in the interests of the
      contractor; the old fellow himself thought he was acting in the interests
      of his niece, and he gave it as his opinion that thirty thousand francs
      would finish the house. Thus, in the course of one week la Peyrade became
      Brigitte&rsquo;s god; and she proved to him by the most naively nefarious
      arguments that fortune should be seized when it offered itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if there <i>is</i> any sin in the business,&rdquo; she said to him in the
      middle of the garden, &ldquo;you can confess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, &ldquo;a man owes himself to his relatives, and
      you are one of us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I decide to do it,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, in a voice of emotion; &ldquo;but
      on conditions that I must now distinctly state. I will not, in marrying
      Celeste, be accused of greed and mercenary motives. If you lay remorse
      upon me, at least you must consent that I shall remain as I am for the
      present. Do not settle upon Celeste, my old Thuillier, the future
      possession of the property I am about to obtain for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rob yourself; and let my dear little aunt here act in the same way
      in relation to the marriage contract. Put the remainder of the capital in
      Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s name, on the Grand Livre, and she can do what she likes
      with it. We shall all live together as one family, and I&rsquo;ll undertake to
      make my own fortune, now that I am free from anxiety about the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the talk of an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me kiss you on the forehead, my son,&rdquo; said the old maid; &ldquo;but,
      inasmuch as Celeste cannot be allowed to go without a &lsquo;dot,&rsquo; we shall give
      her sixty thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For her dress,&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all three persons of honor,&rdquo; cried Thuillier. &ldquo;It is now settled,
      isn&rsquo;t it? You are to manage the purchase of the house; we are to write
      together, you and I, my political work; and you&rsquo;ll bestir yourself to get
      me the decoration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have that as soon as you are made a municipal councillor on the
      1st of May. Only, my good friend, I must beg you, and you, too, dear aunt,
      to keep the most profound secrecy about me in this affair; and do not
      listen to the calumnies which all the men I am about to trick will spread
      about me. I shall become, you&rsquo;ll see, a vagabond, a swindler, a dangerous
      man, a Jesuit, an ambitious fortune-hunter. Can you hear those accusations
      against me with composure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; replied Brigitte.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE REIGN OF THEODOSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      From that day forth Thuillier became a dear, good friend. &ldquo;My dear, good
      friend,&rdquo; was the name given to him by Theodose, with voice inflections of
      varieties of tenderness which astonished Flavie. But &ldquo;little aunt,&rdquo; a name
      that flattered Brigitte deeply, was only given in family secrecy, and
      occasionally before Flavie. The activity of Theodose and Dutocq, Cerizet,
      Barbet, Metivier, Minard, Phellion, Colleville, and others of the
      Thuillier circle was extreme. Great and small, they all put their hands to
      the work. Cadenet procured thirty votes in his section. On the 30th of
      April Thuillier was proclaimed member of the Council-general of the
      department of the Seine by an imposing majority; in fact, he only needed
      sixty more votes to make his election unanimous. May 1st Thuillier joined
      the municipal body and went to the Tuileries to congratulate the King on
      his fete-day, and returned home radiant. He had gone where Minard went!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days later a yellow poster announced the sale of the house, after due
      publication; the price named being seventy-five thousand francs; the final
      purchase to take place about the last of July. On this point Cerizet and
      Claparon had an agreement by which Cerizet pledged the sum of fifteen
      thousand francs (in words only, be it understood) to Claparon in case the
      latter could deceive the notary and keep him quiet until the time expired
      during which he might withdraw the property by bidding it in. Mademoiselle
      Thuillier, notified by Theodose, agreed entirely to this secret clause,
      understanding perfectly the necessity of paying the culprits guilty of the
      treachery. The money was to pass through la Peyrade&rsquo;s hands. Claparon met
      his accomplice, the notary, on the Place de l&rsquo;Observatoire by midnight.
      This young man, the successor of Leopold Hannequin, was one of those who
      run after fortune instead of following it leisurely. He now saw another
      future before him, and he managed his present affairs in order to be free
      to take hold of it. In this midnight interview, he offered Claparon ten
      thousand francs to secure himself in this dirty business,&mdash;a sum
      which was only to be paid on receipt, through Claparon, of a counter-deed
      from the nominal purchaser of the property. The notary was aware that that
      sum was all-important to Claparon to extricate him from present
      difficulties, and he felt secure of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who but you, in all Paris, would give me such a fee for such an affair?&rdquo;
       Claparon said to him, with a false show of naivete. &ldquo;You can sleep in
      peace; my ostensible purchaser is one of those men of honor who are too
      stupid to have ideas of your kind; he is a retired government employee;
      give him the money to make the purchase and he&rsquo;ll sign the counter-deed at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the notary had made Claparon clearly understand that he could not get
      more than the ten thousand francs from him, Cerizet offered the latter
      twelve thousand down, and asked Theodose for fifteen thousand, intending
      to keep the balance for himself. All these scenes between the four men
      were seasoned with the finest speeches about feelings, integrity, and the
      honor that men owed to one another in doing business. While these
      submarine performances were going on, apparently in the interests of
      Thuillier, to whom Theodose related them with the deepest manifestations
      of disgust at being implicated therein, the pair were meditating the great
      political work which &ldquo;my dear good friend&rdquo; was to publish. Thus the new
      municipal councillor naturally acquired a conviction that he could never
      do or be anything without the help of this man of genius; whose mind so
      amazed him, and whose ability was now so important to him, that every day
      he became more and more convinced of the necessity of marrying him to
      Celeste, and of taking the young couple to live with him. In fact, after
      May the 1st, Theodose had already dined four times a week with &ldquo;my dear,
      good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the period when Theodose reigned without a dissenting voice in
      the bosom of that household, and all the friends of the family approved of
      him&mdash;for the following reason: The Phellions, hearing his praises
      sung by Brigitte and Thuillier, feared to displease the two powers and
      chorussed their words, even when such perpetual laudation seemed to them
      exaggerated. The same may be said of the Minards. Moreover la Peyrade&rsquo;s
      behavior, as &ldquo;friend of the family&rdquo; was perfect. He disarmed distrust by
      the manner in which he effaced himself; he was there like a new piece of
      furniture; and he contrived to make both the Phellions and Minards believe
      that Brigitte and Thuillier had weighed him, and found him too light in
      the scales to be anything more in the family than a young man whose
      services were useful to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may think,&rdquo; said Thuillier one day to Minard, &ldquo;that my sister will put
      him in her will; he doesn&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech, inspired by Theodose himself, calmed the uneasiness of Minard
      &ldquo;pere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is devoted to us,&rdquo; said Brigitte to Madame Phellion; &ldquo;but he certainly
      owes us a great deal of gratitude. We have given him his lodging
      rent-free, and he dines with us almost every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech of the old maid, also instigated by Theodose, went from ear to
      ear among the families who frequented the Thuillier salon, and dissipated
      all fears. The young man called attention to the remarks of Thuillier and
      his sister with the servility of a parasite; when he played whist he
      justified the blunders of his dear, good friend, and he kept upon his
      countenance a smile, fixed and benign, like that of Madame Thuillier,
      ready to bestow upon all the bourgeois sillinesses of the brother and
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obtained, what he wanted above all, the contempt of his true
      antagonists; and he used it as a cloak to hide his real power. For four
      consecutive months his face wore a torpid expression, like that of a snake
      as it gulps and digests its prey. But at times he would rush into the
      garden with Colleville or Flavie, to laugh and lay off his mask, and rest
      himself; or get fresh strength by giving way before his future
      mother-in-law to fits of nervous passion which either terrified or deeply
      touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you pity me?&rdquo; he cried to her the evening before the preparatory
      sale of the house, when Thuillier was to make the purchase at seventy-five
      thousand francs. &ldquo;Think of a man like me, forced to creep like a cat, to
      choke down every pointed word, to swallow my own gall, and submit to your
      rebuffs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend! my child!&rdquo; Flavie replied, undecided in mind how to take him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words are a thermometer which will show the temperature at which
      this clever manipulator maintained his intrigue with Flavie. He kept her
      floating between her heart and her moral sense, between religious
      sentiments and this mysterious passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Felix Phellion was giving, with a devotion and constancy
      worthy of all praise, regular lessons to young Colleville. He spent much
      of his time upon these lessons, feeling that he was thus working for his
      future family. To acknowledge this service, he was invited, by advice of
      Theodose to Flavie, to dine at the Collevilles&rsquo; every Thursday, where la
      Peyrade always met him. Flavie was usually making either a purse or
      slippers or a cigar-case for the happy young man, who would say,
      deprecatingly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only too well rewarded, madame, by the happiness I feel in being
      useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not rich, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Colleville, &ldquo;but, God bless me! we
      are not ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Phellion would rub his hands as he listened to his son&rsquo;s account of
      these evenings, beholding his dear and noble Felix already wedded to
      Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Celeste, the more she loved Felix, the more grave and serious she
      became with him; partly because her mother sharply lectured her, saying to
      her one evening:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give any hope whatever to that young Phellion. Neither your father
      nor I can arrange your marriage. You have expectations to be consulted. It
      is much less important to please a professor without a penny than to make
      sure of the affection and good-will of Mademoiselle Brigitte and your
      godfather. If you don&rsquo;t want to kill your mother&mdash;yes, my dear, kill
      her&mdash;you must obey me in this affair blindly; and remember that what
      we want to secure, above all, is your good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the date of the final sale was set for the last of July, Theodose
      advised Brigitte by the end of June to arrange her affairs in time to be
      ready for the payment. Accordingly, she now sold out her own and her
      sister-in-law&rsquo;s property in the Funds. The catastrophe of the treaty of
      the four powers, an insult to France, is now an established historical
      fact; but it is necessary to remind the reader that from July to the last
      of August the French funds, alarmed by the prospect of war, a fear which
      Monsieur Thiers did much to promote, fell twenty francs, and the
      Three-per-cents went down to sixty. That was not all: this financial
      fiasco had a most unfortunate influence on the value of real estate in
      Paris; and all those who had such property then for sale suffered loss.
      These events made Theodose a prophet in the eyes of Brigitte and
      Thuillier, to whom the house was now about to be definitely sold for
      seventy-five thousand francs. The notary, involved in the political
      disaster, and whose practice was already sold, concealed himself for a
      time in the country; but he took with him the ten thousand francs for
      Claparon. Advised by Theodose, Thuillier made a contract with Grindot, who
      supposed he was really working for the notary in finishing the house; and
      as, during this period of financial depression, suspended work left many
      workmen with their arms folded, the architect was able to finish off the
      building in a splendid manner at a low cost. Theodose insisted that the
      agreement should be in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This purchase increased Thuillier&rsquo;s importance ten-fold. As for the
      notary, he had temporarily lost his head in presence of political events
      which came upon him like a waterspout out of cloudless skies. Theodose,
      certain now of his supremacy, holding Thuillier fast by his past services
      and by the literary work in which they were both engaged, admired by
      Brigitte for his modesty and discretion,&mdash;for never had he made the
      slightest allusion to his own poverty or uttered one word about money,&mdash;Theodose
      began to assume an air that was rather less servile than it had been.
      Brigitte and Thuillier said to him one day:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can deprive you of our esteem; you are here in this house as if
      in your own home; the opinion of Minard and Phellion, which you seem to
      fear, has no more value for us than a stanza of Victor Hugo. Therefore,
      let them talk! Carry your head high!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall still need them for Thuillier&rsquo;s election to the Chamber,&rdquo;
       said Theodose. &ldquo;Follow my advice; you have found it good so far, haven&rsquo;t
      you? When the house is actually yours, you will have got it for almost
      nothing; for you can now buy into the Three-per-cents at sixty in Madame
      Thuillier&rsquo;s name, and thus replace nearly the whole of her fortune. Wait
      only for the expiration of the time allowed to the nominal creditor to buy
      it in, and have the fifteen thousand francs ready for our scoundrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte did not wait; she took her whole capital with the exception of a
      sum of one hundred and twenty thousand francs, and bought into the
      Three-per-cents in Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s name to the amount of twelve
      thousand francs a year, and in her own for ten thousand a year, resolving
      in her own mind to choose no other kind of investment in future. She saw
      her brother secure of forty thousand francs a year besides his pension,
      twelve thousand a year for Madame Thuillier and eighteen thousand a year
      for herself, besides the house they lived in, the rental of which she
      valued at eight thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are worth quite as much as the Minards,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chant victory before you win it,&rdquo; said Theodose. &ldquo;The right of
      redemption doesn&rsquo;t expire for another week. I have attended to your
      affairs, but mine have gone terribly to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, you have friends,&rdquo; cried Brigitte; &ldquo;if you should happen
      to want five hundred francs or so, you will always find them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose exchanged a smile with Thuillier, who hastened to carry him off,
      saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my poor sister; she sees the world through a small hole. But if
      you should want twenty-five thousand francs I&rsquo;ll lend them to you&mdash;out
      of my first rents,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier,&rdquo; exclaimed Theodose, &ldquo;the rope is round my neck. Ever since I
      have been a barrister I have had notes of hand running. But say nothing
      about it,&rdquo; added Theodose, frightened himself at having let out the secret
      of his situation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the claws of scoundrels, but I hope to crush
      them yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In telling this secret Theodose, though alarmed as he did so, had a
      two-fold purpose: first, to test Thuillier; and next, to avert the
      consequences of a fatal blow which might be dealt to him any day in a
      secret and sinister struggle he had long foreseen. Two words will explain
      his horrible position.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. DEVILS AGAINST DEVILS
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the extreme poverty of la Peyrade&rsquo;s first years in Paris, none but
      Cerizet had ever gone to see him in the wretched garret where, in severely
      cold weather, he stayed in bed for want of clothes. Only one shirt
      remained to him. For three days he lived on one loaf of bread, cutting it
      into measured morsels, and asking himself, &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; At this
      moment it was that his former partner came to him, having just left
      prison, pardoned. The projects which the two men then formed before a fire
      of laths, one wrapped in his landlady&rsquo;s counterpane, the other in his
      infamy, it is useless to relate. The next day Cerizet, who had talked with
      Dutocq in the course of the morning, returned, bringing trousers,
      waistcoat, coat, hat, and boots, bought in the Temple, and he carried off
      Theodose to dine with himself and Dutocq. The hungry Provencal ate at
      Pinson&rsquo;s, rue de l&rsquo;Ancienne Comedie, half of a dinner costing forty-seven
      francs. At dessert, after Theodose had drunk freely, Cerizet said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sign me bills of exchange for fifty thousand francs in your
      capacity as a barrister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get five thousand on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your affair, but ours; I mean monsieur&rsquo;s here, who is giving
      us this dinner, and mine, in a matter where you risk nothing, but in which
      you&rsquo;ll get your title as barrister, a fine practice, and the hand in
      marriage of a girl about the age of an old dog, and rich by twenty or
      thirty thousand francs a year. Neither Dutocq nor I can marry her; but
      we&rsquo;ll equip you, give you the look of a decent man, feed and lodge you,
      and set you up generally. Consequently, we want security. I don&rsquo;t say that
      on my own account, for I know you, but for monsieur here, whose proxy I
      am. We&rsquo;ll equip you as a pirate, hey! to do the white-slave trade! If we
      can&rsquo;t capture that &lsquo;dot,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll try other plans. Between ourselves, none
      of us need be particular what we touch&mdash;that&rsquo;s plain enough. We&rsquo;ll
      give you careful instructions; for the matter is certain to take time, and
      there&rsquo;ll probably be some bother about it. Here, see, I have brought
      stamped paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter, pens and ink!&rdquo; cried Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I like fellows of that kind!&rdquo; exclaimed Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign: &lsquo;Theodose de la Peyrade,&rsquo; and after your name put &lsquo;Barrister, rue
      Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer,&rsquo; under the words &lsquo;Accepted for ten thousand.&rsquo; 
      We&rsquo;ll date the notes and sue you,&mdash;all secretly, of course, but in
      order to have a hold upon you; the owners of a privateer ought to have
      security when the brig and the captain are at sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day after this interview the bailiff of the justice-of-peace did
      Cerizet the service of suing la Peyrade secretly. He went to see the
      barrister that evening, and the whole affair was done without any
      publicity. The Court of commerce has a hundred such cases in the course of
      one term. The strict regulations of the council of barristers of the bar
      of Paris are well known. This body, and also the council of attorneys,
      exercise severe discipline over their members. A barrister liable to go to
      Clichy would be disbarred. Consequently, Cerizet, under Dutocq&rsquo;s advice,
      had taken against their puppet measures which were certain to secure to
      each of them twenty-five thousand francs out of Celeste&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot.&rdquo; In
      signing the notes, Theodose saw but one thing,&mdash;his means of living
      secured; but as time had gone on, and the horizon grew clearer, and he
      mounted, step by step, to a better position on the social ladder, he began
      to dream of getting rid of his associates. And now, on obtaining
      twenty-five thousand francs from Thuillier, he hoped to treat on the basis
      of fifty per cent for the return of his fatal notes by Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this sort of infamous speculation is not an exceptional
      fact; it takes place in Paris under various forms too little disguised for
      the historian of manners and morals to pass them over unnoticed in a
      complete and accurate picture of society in the nineteenth century.
      Dutocq, an arrant scoundrel, still owed fifteen thousand francs on his
      practice, and lived in hopes of something turning up to keep his head, as
      the saying is, above water until the close of 1840. Up to the present time
      none of the three confederates had flinched or groaned. Each felt his
      strength and knew his danger. Equals they were in distrust, in
      watchfulness; equals, too, in apparent confidence; and equally stolid in
      silence and look when mutual suspicions rose to the surface of face or
      speech. For the last two months the position of Theodose was acquiring the
      strength of a detached fort. But Cerizet and Dutocq held it undermined by
      a mass of powder, with the match ever lighted; but the wind might
      extinguish the match or the devil might flood the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment when wild beasts seize their food is always the most critical,
      and that moment had now arrived for these three hungry tigers. Cerizet
      would sometimes say to Theodose, with that revolutionary glance which
      twice in this century sovereigns have had to meet:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made you king, and here am I still nothing! for it is nothing not
      to be all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reaction of envy was rushing its avalanche through Cerizet. Dutocq was
      at the mercy of his copying clerk. Theodose would gladly have burned his
      copartners could he have burned their papers in the same conflagration.
      All three studied each other too carefully, in order to conceal their own
      thoughts, not to be in turn divined. Theodose lived a life of three hells
      as he thought of what lay below the cards, then of his own game, and then
      of his future. His speech to Thuillier was a cry of despair; he threw his
      lead into the waters of the old bourgeois and found there nothing more
      than twenty-five thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said to himself as he went to his own room, &ldquo;possibly nothing at
      all a month hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He new felt the deepest hatred to the Thuilliers. But Thuillier himself he
      held by a harpoon stuck into the depths of the man&rsquo;s vanity; namely, by
      the projected work, entitled &ldquo;Taxation and the Sinking Fund,&rdquo; for which he
      intended to rearrange the ideas of the Saint-Simonian &ldquo;Globe,&rdquo; giving them
      a systematic form, and coloring them with his fervid Southern diction.
      Thuillier&rsquo;s bureaucratic knowledge of the subject would be of use to him
      here. Theodose therefore clung to this rope, resolving to do battle, on so
      poor a base of operations, with the vanity of a fool, which, according to
      individual character, is either granite or sand. On reflection, Theodose
      was inclined to be content with the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening before the right of redemption expired, Claparon and
      Cerizet proceeded to manipulate the notary in the following manner.
      Cerizet, to whom Claparon had revealed the password and the notary&rsquo;s
      retreat, went out to this hiding-place to say to the latter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my friends, Claparon, whom you know, has asked me to come and see
      you; he will expect you to-morrow, in the evening, you know where. He has
      the paper you expect from him, which he will exchange with you for the ten
      thousand agreed upon; but I must be present, for five thousand of that sum
      belong to me; and I warn you, my dear monsieur, that the name in the
      counter-deed is in blank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be there,&rdquo; replied the ex-notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor devil waited the whole night in agonies of mind that can well be
      imagined, for safety or inevitable ruin were in the balance. At sunrise he
      saw approaching him, instead of Claparon, a bailiff of the Court of
      commerce, who produced a judgment against him in regular form, and
      informed him that he must go with him to Clichy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had made an arrangement with one of the creditors of the luckless
      notary, pledging himself to deliver up the debtor on payment to himself of
      half the debt. Out of the ten thousand francs promised to Claparon, the
      victim of this trap was obliged, in order to obtain his liberty, to pay
      six thousand down, the amount of his debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving his share of this extortion Cerizet said to himself: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      three thousand to make Cerizet clear out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet then returned to the notary and said: &ldquo;Claparon is a scoundrel,
      monsieur; he has received fifteen thousand francs from the proposed
      purchaser of your house, who will now, of course, become the owner.
      Threaten to reveal his hiding-place to his creditors, and to have him sued
      for fraudulent bankruptcy, and he&rsquo;ll give you half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his wrath the notary wrote a fulminating letter to Claparon. Claparon,
      alarmed, feared an arrest, and Cerizet offered to get him a passport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have played me many a trick, Claparon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but listen to me
      now, and you can judge of my kindness. I possess, as my whole means, three
      thousand francs; I&rsquo;ll give them to you; start for America, and make your
      fortune there, as I&rsquo;m trying to make mine here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Claparon, carefully disguised by Cerizet, left for Havre by
      the diligence. Cerizet remained master of the fifteen thousand francs to
      be paid to Claparon, and he awaited Theodose with the payment thereof
      tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The limit for bidding-in is passed,&rdquo; thought Theodose, as he went to find
      Dutocq and ask him to bring Cerizet to his office. &ldquo;Suppose I were now to
      make an effort to get rid of my leech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t settle this affair anywhere but at Cerizet&rsquo;s, because Claparon
      must be present, and he is hiding there,&rdquo; said Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Theodose went, between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock, to the den of
      the &ldquo;banker of the poor,&rdquo; whom Dutocq had notified of his coming. Cerizet
      received him in the horrible kitchen where miseries and sorrows were
      chopped and cooked, as we have seen already. The pair then walked up and
      down, precisely like two animals in a cage, while mutually playing the
      following scene:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you brought the fifteen thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I have them at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not have them in your pocket?&rdquo; asked Cerizet, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied Theodose, who, as he walked from the rue
      Saint-Dominique to the Estrapade, had decided on his course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Provencal, writhing upon the gridiron on which his partners held him,
      became suddenly possessed with a good idea, which flashed from the body of
      the live coal under him. Peril has gleams of light. He resolved to rely on
      the power of frankness, which affects all men, even swindlers. Every one
      is grateful to an adversary who bares himself to the waist in a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;now the humbug begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to come wholly through the hole in his nose with horrible
      intonations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put me in a magnificent position, and I shall never forget the
      service you have done me, my friend,&rdquo; began Theodose, with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s how you take it, is it?&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me; you don&rsquo;t understand my intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; replied the lender by &ldquo;the little week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend not to give up those fifteen thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose shrugged his shoulders and looked fixedly at Cerizet, who, struck
      by the two motions, kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you live in my position, knowing yourself within range of a cannon
      loaded with grape-shot, without feeling a strong desire to get out of it?
      Now listen to me carefully. You are doing a dangerous business, and you
      would be glad enough to have some solid protection in the very heart of
      the magistracy of Paris. If I can continue my present course, I shall be
      substitute attorney-general, possibly attorney-general, in three years. I
      offer you to-day the offices of a devoted friendship, which will serve you
      hereafter most assuredly, if only to replace you in a honorable position.
      Here are my conditions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conditions!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten minutes I will bring you twenty-five thousand francs if you return
      to me all the notes which you have against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dutocq? and Claparon?&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave them in the lurch!&rdquo; replied Theodose, with his lips at Cerizet&rsquo;s
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty thing to say!&rdquo; cried Cerizet. &ldquo;And so you have invented
      this little game of hocus-pocus because you hold in your fingers fifteen
      thousand francs that don&rsquo;t belong to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve added ten thousand francs to them. Besides, you and I know each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are able to get ten thousand francs out of your bourgeois you can
      surely get fifteen,&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;For thirty thousand I&rsquo;m your man.
      Frankness for frankness, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask the impossible,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;At this very moment, if you
      had to do with Claparon instead of with me, your fifteen thousand would be
      lost, for Thuillier is to-day the owner of that house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Claparon,&rdquo; said Cerizet, pretending to go and consult him,
      and mounting the stairs to the bedroom, from which Claparon had only just
      departed on his road to Havre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two adversaries had been speaking, we should here remark, in a manner
      not to be overheard; and every time that Theodose raised his voice Cerizet
      would make a gesture, intimating that Claparon, from above, might be
      listening. The five minutes during which Theodose heard what seemed to be
      the murmuring of two voices were torture to him, for he had staked his
      very life upon the issue. Cerizet at last came down, with a smile upon his
      lips, his eyes sparkling with infernal mischief, his whole frame quivering
      in his joy, a Lucifer of gaiety!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing, so it seems!&rdquo; he cried, shaking his shoulders, &ldquo;but
      Claparon knows a great deal; he has worked with the big-wig bankers, and
      when I told what you wanted he began to laugh, and said, &lsquo;I thought as
      much!&rsquo; You will have to bring me the twenty-five thousand you offer me
      to-morrow morning, my lad; and as much more before you can recover your
      notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Theodose, feeling his spinal column liquidizing as if the
      discharge of some inward electric fluid had melted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claparon has bit it in under the name of one of his creditors, a little
      toad named Sauvaignou. Desroches, the lawyer, has taken the case, and
      you&rsquo;ll get a notice to-morrow. This affair will oblige Claparon, Dutocq,
      and me to raise funds. What would become of me without Claparon! So I
      forgive him&mdash;yes, I forgave him, and though you may not believe it,
      my dear friend, I actually kissed him! Change your terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last three words were horrible to hear, especially when illustrated by
      the face of the speaker, who amused himself by playing a scene from the
      &ldquo;Legataire,&rdquo; all the while studying attentively the Provencal&rsquo;s character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cerizet!&rdquo; cried Theodose; &ldquo;I, who wished to do you so much good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, my dear fellow,&rdquo; returned Cerizet, &ldquo;that between you and
      me there ought to be <i>this</i>,&mdash;&rdquo; and he struck his heart,&mdash;&ldquo;of
      which you have none. As soon as you thought you had a lever on us, you
      have tried to knock us over. I saved you from the horrors of starvation
      and vermin! You&rsquo;ll die like the idiot you are. We put you on the high-road
      to fortune; we gave you a fine social skin and a position in which you
      could grasp the future&mdash;and look what you do! <i>Now</i> I know you!
      and from this time forth, we shall go armed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is war between us!&rdquo; exclaimed Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fired first,&rdquo; returned Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you pull me down, farewell to your hopes and plans; if you don&rsquo;t pull
      me down, you have in me an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I said yesterday to Dutocq; but, how can we help it? We
      are forced to choose between two alternatives&mdash;we must go according
      to circumstances. I&rsquo;m a good-natured fellow myself,&rdquo; he added, after a
      pause; &ldquo;bring me your twenty-five thousand francs to-morrow morning and
      Thuillier shall keep the house. We&rsquo;ll continue to help you at both ends,
      but you&rsquo;ll have to pay up, my boy. After what has just happened that&rsquo;s
      pretty kind, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cerizet patted Theodose on the shoulder, with a cynicism that seemed
      to brand him more than the iron of the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give me till to-morrow at mid-day,&rdquo; replied the Provencal, &ldquo;for
      there&rsquo;ll be, as you said, some manipulation to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to keep Claparon quiet; he&rsquo;s in such a hurry, that man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow then,&rdquo; said Theodose, in the tone of a man who decides his
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, friend,&rdquo; said Cerizet, in his nasal tone, which degraded the
      finest word in the language. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one who has got a mouthful to suck!&rdquo;
       thought Cerizet, as he watched Theodose going down the street with the
      step of a dazed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When la Peyrade reached the rue des Postes he went with rapid strides to
      Madame Colleville&rsquo;s house, exciting himself as he walked along, and
      talking aloud. The fire of his roused passions and the sort of inward
      conflagration of which many Parisians are conscious (for such situations
      abound in Paris) brought him finally to a pitch of frenzy and eloquence
      which found expression, as he turned into the rue des Deux-Eglises, in the
      words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will kill him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fellow who is not content!&rdquo; said a passing workman, and the
      jesting words calmed the incandescent madness to which Theodose was a
      prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left Cerizet&rsquo;s the idea came to him to go to Flavie and tell her
      all. Southern natures are born thus&mdash;strong until certain passions
      arise, and then collapsed. He entered Flavie&rsquo;s room; she was alone, and
      when she saw Theodose she fancied her last hour had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you love me, Flavie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how can you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me absolutely?&mdash;if I were criminal, even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he murdered some one?&rdquo; she thought, replying to his question by a
      nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodose, thankful to seize even this branch of willow, drew a chair
      beside Flavie&rsquo;s sofa, and there gave way to sobs that might have touched
      the oldest judge, while torrents of tears began to flow from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavie rose and left the room to say to her maid: &ldquo;I am not at home to any
      one.&rdquo; Then she closed all doors and returned to Theodose, moved to the
      utmost pitch of maternal solicitude. She found him stretched out, his head
      thrown back, and weeping. He had taken out his handkerchief, and when
      Flavie tried to move it from his face it was heavy with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;what ails you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nature, more impressive than art, served Theodose well; no longer was he
      playing a part; he was himself; this nervous crisis and these tears were
      the winding up of his preceding scenes of acted comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a child,&rdquo; she said, in a gentle voice, stroking his hair softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but you, you only, in all the world!&rdquo; he replied, kissing her
      hands with a sort of passion; &ldquo;and if you are true to me, if you are mine,
      as the body belongs to the soul and the soul to the body, then&mdash;&rdquo; he
      added, recovering himself with infinite grace, &ldquo;<i>Then</i> I can have
      courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and walked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will struggle; I will recover my strength, like Antaeus, from a
      fall; I will strangle with my own hands the serpents that entwine me, that
      kiss with serpent kisses, that slaver my cheeks, that suck my blood, my
      honor! Oh, misery! oh, poverty! Oh, how great are they who can stand erect
      and carry high their heads! I had better have let myself die of hunger,
      there, on my wretched pallet, three and a half years ago! A coffin is a
      softer bed to lie in than the life I lead! It is eighteen months that I
      have <i>fed on bourgeois</i>! and now, at the moment of attaining an
      honest, fortunate life, a magnificent future, at the moment when I was
      about to sit down to the social banquet, the executioner strikes me on the
      shoulder! Yes, the monster! he struck me there, on my shoulder, and said
      to me: &lsquo;Pay thy dues to the devil, or die!&rsquo; And shall I not crush them?
      Shall I not force my arm down their throats to their very entrails? Yes,
      yes, I will, I will! See, Flavie, my eyes are dry now. Ha, ha! now I
      laugh; I feel my strength come back to me; power is mine! Oh! say that you
      love me; say it again! At this moment it sounds like the word &lsquo;Pardon&rsquo; to
      the man condemned to death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are terrible, my friend!&rdquo; cried Flavie. &ldquo;Oh! you are killing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She understood nothing of all this, but she fell upon the sofa, exhausted
      by the spectacle. Theodose flung himself at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! forgive me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter? what is it?&rdquo; she asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are trying to destroy me. Oh! promise to give me Celeste, and you
      shall see what a glorious life I will make you share. If you hesitate&mdash;very
      good; that is saying you will be wholly mine, and I will have you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made so rapid a movement that Flavie, terrified, rose and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my saint!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;at thy feet I fall&mdash;a miracle! God is for
      me, surely! A flash of light has come to me&mdash;an idea&mdash;suddenly!
      Oh, thanks, my good angel, my grand Saint-Theodose! thou hast saved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flavie could not help admiring that chameleon being; one knee on the
      floor, his hands crossed on his breast, and his eyes raised to heaven in
      religious ecstasy, he recited a prayer; he was a fervent Catholic; he
      reverently crossed himself. It was fine; like the vision of Saint-Jerome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; he said, with a melancholy look and a moving tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Flavie, &ldquo;leave me this handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose rushed away like one possessed, sprang into the street, and
      darted towards the Thuilliers&rsquo;, but turned, saw Flavie at her window, and
      made her a little sign of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man!&rdquo; she thought to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good friend,&rdquo; he said to Thuillier, in a calm and gentle, almost
      caressing voice, &ldquo;we have fallen into the hands of atrocious scoundrels.
      But I mean to read them a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want twenty-five thousand francs, and, in order to get the better of
      us, the notary, or his accomplices, have determined to bid in the
      property. Thuillier, put five thousand francs in your pocket and come with
      me; I will secure that house to you. I am making myself implacable
      enemies!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;they are seeking to destroy me morally. But all I ask
      is that you will disregard their infamous calumnies and feel no change of
      heart to me. After all, what is it? If I succeed, you will only have paid
      one hundred and twenty-five thousand francs for the house instead of one
      hundred and twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided the same thing doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; said Brigitte, uneasily,
      her eyes dilating under the effect of a violent suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Preferred creditors have alone the right to bid in property, and as, in
      this case, there is but one, and he has used that right, we are safe. The
      amount of his claim is really only two thousand francs, but there are
      lawyers, attorneys, and so forth, to pay in such matters, and we shall
      have to drop a note of a thousand francs to make the creditor happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Thuillier,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;get your hat and gloves, and take the
      money&mdash;from you know where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I paid those fifteen thousand francs without success, I don&rsquo;t wish to
      have any more money pass through my hands. Thuillier must pay it himself,&rdquo;
       said Theodose, when he found himself alone with Brigitte. &ldquo;You have,
      however, gained twenty thousand on the contract I enabled you to make with
      Grindot, who thought he was serving the notary, and you own a piece of
      property which in five years will be worth nearly a million. It is what is
      called a &lsquo;boulevard corner.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte listened uneasily, precisely like a cat which hears a mouse
      within the wall. She looked Theodose straight in the eye, and, in spite of
      the truth of his remarks, doubts possessed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What troubles you, little aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall be in mortal terror until that property is securely ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be willing to give twenty thousand francs, wouldn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; said
      Theodose, &ldquo;to make sure that Thuillier was what we call, in law, &lsquo;owner
      not dispossessable&rsquo; of that property? Well, then, remember that I have
      saved you twice that amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Maitre Godeschal! We must employ him as our attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we refused him for Celeste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one reason for going to him,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;I have
      taken his measure; he&rsquo;s a man of honor, and he&rsquo;ll think it a fine thing to
      do you a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Godeschal, now Derville&rsquo;s successor, had formerly been, for more than two
      years, head-clerk with Desroches. Theodose, to whom that circumstance was
      known, seemed to hear the name flung into his ear in the midst of his
      despair by an inward voice, and he foresaw a possibility of wrenching from
      the hands of Claparon the weapon with which Cerizet had threatened him. He
      must, however, in the first instance, gain an entrance to Desroches, and
      get some light on the actual situation of his enemies. Godeschal, by
      reason of the intimacy still existing between the former clerk and his old
      master, could be his go-between. When the attorneys of Paris have ties
      like those which bound Godeschal and Desroches together, they live in true
      fraternity, and the result is a facility in arranging any matters which
      are, as one may say, arrangeable. They obtain from one another, on the
      ground of reciprocity, all possible concessions by the application of the
      proverb, &ldquo;Pass me the rhubarb, and I&rsquo;ll pass you the senna,&rdquo; which is put
      in practice in all professions, between ministers, soldiers, judges,
      business men; wherever, in short, enmity has not raised barriers too
      strong and high between the parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gain a pretty good fee out of this compromise,&rdquo; is a reason that needs
      no expression in words: it is visible in the gesture, the tone, the
      glance; and as attorneys and solicitors meet constantly on this ground,
      the matter, whatever it is, is arranged. The counterpoise of this
      fraternal system is found in what we may call professional conscience. The
      public must believe the physician who says, giving medical testimony,
      &ldquo;This body contains arsenic&rdquo;; nothing is supposed to exceed the integrity
      of the legislator, the independence of the cabinet minister. In like
      manner, the attorney of Paris says to his brother lawyer, good-humoredly,
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t obtain that; my client is furious,&rdquo; and the other answers,
      &ldquo;Very good; I must do without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, la Peyrade, a shrewd man, had worn his legal gown about the Palais
      long enough to know how these judicial morals might be made to serve his
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in the carriage,&rdquo; he said to Thuillier, when they reached the rue
      Vivienne, where Godeschal was now master of the practice he had formerly
      served as clerk. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t show yourself until he undertakes the
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o&rsquo;clock at night; la Peyrade was not mistaken in supposing
      that he should find a newly fledged master of a practice in his office at
      that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what do I owe this visit, monsieur?&rdquo; said Godeschal, coming forward to
      meet the barrister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreigners, provincials, and persons in high society may not be aware that
      barristers are to attorneys what generals are to marshals. There exists a
      line of demarcation, strictly maintained, between the order of barristers
      and the guild of attorneys and solicitors in Paris. However venerable an
      attorney may be, however capable and strong in his profession, he must go
      to the barrister. The attorney is the administrator, who maps out the plan
      of the campaign, collects the munitions of war, and puts the force in
      motion; the barrister gives battle. It is not known why the law gives a
      man two men to defend him any more than it is known why an author is
      forced to have both printer and publisher. The rules of the bar forbid its
      members to do any act belonging to the guild of attorneys. It is very rare
      that a barrister puts his foot in an attorney&rsquo;s office; the two classes
      meet in the law-courts. In society, there is no barrier between them, and
      some barristers, those in la Peyrade&rsquo;s situation particularly, demean
      themselves by calling occasionally on attorneys, though even these cases
      are rare, and are usually excused by some special urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come on important business,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;it concerns,
      especially, a question of delicacy which you and I ought to solve
      together. Thuillier is below, in a carriage, and I have come up to see
      you, not as a barrister, but as his friend. You are in a position to do
      him an immense service; and I have told him that you have too noble a soul
      (as a worthy successor of our great Derville must have) not to put your
      utmost capacity at his orders. Here&rsquo;s the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After explaining, wholly to his own advantage, the swindling trick which
      must, he said, be met with caution and ability, the barrister developed
      his plan of campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought, my dear maitre, to go this very evening to Desroches, explain
      the whole plot and persuade him to send to-morrow for his client, this
      Sauvaignou. We&rsquo;ll confess the fellow between us, and if he wants a note
      for a thousand francs over and above the amount of his claim, we&rsquo;ll let
      him have it; not counting the five hundred for you and as much more for
      Desroches, provided Thuillier receives the relinquishment of his claim by
      ten o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning. What does this Sauvaignou want? Nothing but
      money. Well, a haggler like that won&rsquo;t resist the attraction of an extra
      thousand francs, especially if he is only the instrument of a cupidity
      behind him. It is no matter to us how he fights it out with those who
      prompt him. Now, then, do you think you can get the Thuillier family out
      of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see Desroches at once,&rdquo; said Godeschal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before Thuillier gives you a power of attorney and five hundred
      francs. The money should be on the table in a case like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the interview with Thuillier was over, la Peyrade took Godeschal in
      the carriage to the rue du Bethizy, where Desroches lived, explaining that
      it was on their way back to the rue Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer. When they
      stopped at Desroches&rsquo;s door la Peyrade made an appointment with Godeschal
      to meet him there the next morning at seven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade&rsquo;s whole future and fortune lay in the outcome of this
      conference. It is therefore not astonishing that he disregarded the
      customs of the bar and went to Desroches&rsquo;s office, to study Sauvaignou and
      take part in the struggle, in spite of the danger he ran in thus placing
      himself visibly before the eyes of one of the most dreaded attorneys in
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the office and made his salutations, he took note of
      Sauvaignou. The man was, as the name had already told him, from
      Marseilles,&mdash;the foreman of a master-carpenter, entrusted with the
      giving out of sub-contracts. The profits of this work consisted of what he
      could make between the price he paid for the work and that paid to him by
      the master-carpenter; this agreement being exclusive of material, his
      contract being only for labor. The master-carpenter had failed. Sauvaignou
      had thereupon appealed to the court of commerce for recognition as
      creditor with a lien on the property. He was a stocky little man, dressed
      in a gray linen blouse, with a cap on his head, and was seated in an
      armchair. Three banknotes, of a thousand francs each, lying visibly before
      him on Desroches&rsquo;s desk, informed la Peyrade that the negotiation had
      already taken place, and that the lawyers were worsted. Godeschal&rsquo;s eyes
      told the rest, and the glance which Desroches cast at the &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s
      advocate&rdquo; was like the blow of a pick-axe into the earth of a grave.
      Stimulated by his danger, the Provencal became magnificent. He coolly took
      up the bank-notes and folded them, as if to put them in his pocket, saying
      to Desroches:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier has changed his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then we are all agreed,&rdquo; said the terrible attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; your client must now hand over to us the fifty thousand francs we
      have spent on finishing the house, according to the contract between
      Thuillier and Grindot. I did not tell you that yesterday,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to Godeschal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; said Desroches to Sauvaignou. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a case I shall
      not touch without proper guarantees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, messieurs,&rdquo; said Sauvaignou, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t negotiate this matter until I
      have seen the worthy man who paid me five hundred francs on account for
      having signed him that bit of a proxy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you from Marseilles?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, in patois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if he tackles him with patois the fellow is beaten,&rdquo; said Godeschal
      to Desroches in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Marseillais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you poor devil,&rdquo; continued Theodose, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that they want
      to ruin you? Shall I tell you what you ought to do? Pocket these three
      thousand francs, and when your worthy man comes after you, take your rule
      and hit him a rap over the knuckles; tell him he&rsquo;s a rascal who wants you
      to do his dirty work, and instead of that you revoke your proxy and will
      pay him his five hundred francs in the week with three Thursdays. Then be
      off with you to Marseilles with these three thousand francs and your
      savings in your pocket. If anything happens to you there, let me know
      through these gentlemen, and I&rsquo;ll get you out of the scrape; for, don&rsquo;t
      you see? I&rsquo;m not only a Provencal, but I&rsquo;m also one of the leading lawyers
      in Paris, and the friend of the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the workman found a compatriot sanctioning in a tone of authority the
      reasons by which he could betray Cerizet, he capitulated, asking, however,
      for three thousand five hundred francs. That demand having been granted he
      remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is none too much for a rap over the knuckles; he might put me in
      prison for assault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t strike unless he insults you,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;and
      that&rsquo;s self-defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Desroches had assured him that la Peyrade was really a barrister in
      good standing, Sauvaignou signed the relinquishment, which contained a
      receipt for the amount, principal and interest, of his claim, made in
      duplicate between himself and Thuillier, and witnessed by the two
      attorneys; so that the paper was a final settlement of the whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the remaining fifteen hundred between you,&rdquo; whispered la
      Peyrade to Desroches and Godeschal, &ldquo;on condition that you give me the
      relinquishment, which I will have Thuillier accept and sign before his
      notary, Cardot. Poor man! he never closed his eyes all night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Desroches. &ldquo;You may congratulate yourself,&rdquo; he added,
      making Sauvaignou sign the paper, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve earned that money pretty
      easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really mine, isn&rsquo;t it, monsieur?&rdquo; said the Marseillais, already
      uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and legally, too,&rdquo; replied Desroches, &ldquo;only you must let your man
      know this morning that you have revoked your proxy under date of
      yesterday. Go out through my clerk&rsquo;s office, here, this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desroches told his head-clerk what the man was to do, and he sent a
      pupil-clerk with him to see that a sheriff&rsquo;s officer carried the notice to
      Cerizet before ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Desroches,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, pressing the attorney&rsquo;s hand;
      &ldquo;you think of everything; I shall never forget this service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deposit the deed with Cardot till after twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; returned
      Desroches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hay! comrade,&rdquo; cried the barrister, in Provencal, following Sauvaignou
      into the next room, &ldquo;take your Margot to walk about Belleville, and be
      sure you don&rsquo;t go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Sauvaignou. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to-morrow; adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; returned la Peyrade, with a Provencal cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something behind all this,&rdquo; said Desroches in an undertone to
      Godeschal, as la Peyrade followed Sauvaignou into the clerk&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Thuilliers get a splendid piece of property for next to nothing,&rdquo;
       replied Godeschal; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Peyrade and Cerizet look to me like two divers who are fighting under
      water,&rdquo; replied Desroches. &ldquo;What am I to say to Cerizet, who put the
      matter into my hands?&rdquo; he added, as the barrister returned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him that Sauvaignou forced your hand,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you fear nothing?&rdquo; said Desroches, in a sudden manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? oh no! I want to give Cerizet a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, I shall know the truth,&rdquo; said Desroches, in a low tone, to
      Godeschal; &ldquo;no one chatters like a beaten man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade departed, carrying with him the deed of relinquishment. At
      eleven o&rsquo;clock he was in the courtroom of the justice-of-peace, perfectly
      calm, and firm. When he saw Cerizet come in, pale with rage, his eyes full
      of venom, he said in his ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, I&rsquo;m a pretty good fellow myself, and I hold that
      twenty-five thousand francs in good bank-bills at your disposal, whenever
      you will return to me those notes of mine which you hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet looked at the advocate of the poor, without being able to say one
      word in reply; he was green; the bile had struck in.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE PERVERSITY OF DOVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a non-dispossessable property-owner!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, coming home
      after visiting his notary. &ldquo;No human power can get that house away from
      me. Cardot says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bourgeoisie think much more of what their notary tells them than of
      what their attorney says. The notary is nearer to them than any other
      ministerial officer. The Parisian bourgeois never pays a visit to his
      attorney without a sense of fear; whereas he mounts the stairs with
      ever-renewed pleasure to see his notary; he admires that official&rsquo;s virtue
      and his sound good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardot, who is looking for an apartment for one of his clients, wants to
      know about our second floor,&rdquo; continued Thuillier. &ldquo;If I choose he&rsquo;ll
      introduce to me on Sunday a tenant who is ready to sign a lease for
      eighteen years at forty thousand francs and taxes! What do you say to
      that, Brigitte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better wait,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Ah! that dear Theodose, what a fright he gave
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! my dearest girl, I must tell you that when Cardot asked who put me
      in the way of this affair he said I owed him a present of at least ten
      thousand francs. The fact is, I owe it all to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is the son of the house,&rdquo; responded Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad! I&rsquo;ll do him the justice to say that he asks for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear, good friend,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, coming in about three o&rsquo;clock,
      &ldquo;here you are, richissime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And through you, Theodose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, little aunt, have you come to life again? Ah! you were not half
      as frightened as I was. I put your interests before my own; I haven&rsquo;t
      breathed freely till this morning at eleven o&rsquo;clock; and yet I am sure now
      of having two mortal enemies at my heels in the two men I have tricked for
      your sake. As I walked home, just now, I asked myself what could be your
      influence over me to make me commit such a crime, and whether the
      happiness of belonging to your family and becoming your son could ever
      efface the stain I have put upon my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you can confess it,&rdquo; said Thuillier, the free-thinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Theodose to Brigitte, &ldquo;you can pay, in all security, the
      cost of the house,&mdash;eighty thousand francs, and thirty thousand to
      Grindot; in all, with what you have paid in costs, one hundred and twenty
      thousand; and this last twenty thousand added make one hundred and forty
      thousand. If you let the house outright to a single tenant ask him for the
      last year&rsquo;s rent in advance, and reserve for my wife and me the whole of
      the first floor above the entresol. Make those conditions and you&rsquo;ll still
      get your forty thousand francs a year. If you should want to leave this
      quarter so as to be nearer the Chamber, you can always take up your abode
      with us on that vast first floor, which has stables and coach-house
      belonging to it; in fact, everything that is needful for a splendid life.
      And now, Thuillier, I am going to get the cross of the Legion of honor for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this last promise, Brigitte cried out in her enthusiasm:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! my dear boy, you&rsquo;ve done our business so well that I&rsquo;ll leave you
      to manage that of letting the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abdicate, dear aunt,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;God keep me from ever
      taking a step without you! You are the good genius of this family; I think
      only of the day when Thuillier will take his seat in the Chamber. If you
      let the house you will come into possession of your forty thousand francs
      for the last year of the lease in two months from now; and that will not
      prevent Thuillier from drawing his quarterly ten thousand of the rental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After casting this hope into the mind of the old maid, who was jubilant,
      Theodose drew Thuillier into the garden and said to him, without beating
      round the bush:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good friend, find means to get ten thousand francs from your
      sister, and be sure not to let her suspect that you pay them to me; tell
      her that sum is required in the government office to facilitate your
      appointment as chevalier of the Legion of honor; tell her, too, that you
      know the persons among whom that sum should be distributed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;besides, I&rsquo;ll pay it back to her
      when I get my rents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the money ready this evening, dear friend. Now I am going out on
      business about your cross; to-morrow we shall know something definitely
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man you are!&rdquo; cried Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ministry of the 1st of March is going to fall, and we must get it out
      of them beforehand,&rdquo; said Theodose, shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now hurried to Madame Colleville, crying out as he entered her room:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve conquered! We shall have a piece of landed property for Celeste
      worth a million, a life-interest in which will be given to her by her
      marriage-contract; but keep the secret, or your daughter will be hunted
      down by peers of France. Besides, this settlement will only be made in my
      favor. Now dress yourself, and let us go and call on Madame du Bruel; she
      can get the cross for Thuillier. While you are getting under arms I&rsquo;ll do
      a little courting to Celeste; you and I can talk as we drive along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade had seen, as he passed the door of the salon, Celeste and Felix
      Phellion in close conversation. Flavie had such confidence in her daughter
      that she did not fear to leave them together. Now that the great success
      of the morning was secured, Theodose felt the necessity of beginning his
      courtship of Celeste. It was high time, he thought, to bring about a
      quarrel between the lovers. He did not, therefore, hesitate to apply his
      ear to the door of the salon before entering it, in order to discover what
      letters of the alphabet of love they were spelling; he was even invited to
      commit this domestic treachery by sounds from within, which seemed to say
      that they were disputing. Love, according to one of our poets, is a
      privilege which two persons mutually take advantage of to cause each
      other, reciprocally, a great deal of sorrow about nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Celeste knew that Felix was elected by her heart to be the companion
      of her life, she felt a desire, not so much to study him as to unite
      herself closely with him by that communion of souls which is the basis of
      all affections, and leads, in youthful minds, to involuntary examination.
      The dispute to which Theodose was now to listen took its rise in a
      disagreement which had sprung up within the last few days between the
      mathematician and Celeste. The young girl&rsquo;s piety was real; she belonged
      to the flock of the truly faithful, and to her, Catholicism, tempered by
      that mysticism which attracts young souls, was an inward poem, a life
      within her life. From this point young girls are apt to develop into
      either extremely high-minded women or saints. But, during this beautiful
      period of their youth they have in their heart, in their ideas, a sort of
      absolutism: before their eyes is the image of perfection, and all must be
      celestial, angelic, or divine to satisfy them. Outside of their ideal,
      nothing of good can exist; all is stained and soiled. This idea causes the
      rejection of many a diamond with a flaw by girls who, as women, fall in
      love with paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Celeste had seen in Felix, not irreligion, but indifference to
      matters of religion. Like most geometricians, chemists, mathematicians,
      and great naturalists, he had subjected religion to reason; he recognized
      a problem in it as insoluble as the squaring of the circle. Deist &ldquo;in
      petto,&rdquo; he lived in the religion of most Frenchmen, not attaching more
      importance to it than he did to the new laws promulgated in July. It was
      necessary to have a God in heaven, just as they set up a bust of the king
      at the mayor&rsquo;s office. Felix Phellion, a worthy son of his father, had
      never drawn the slightest veil over his opinions or his conscience; he
      allowed Celeste to read into them with the candor and the inattention of a
      student of problems. The young girl, on her side, professed a horror for
      atheism, and her conscience assured her that a deist was cousin-germain to
      an atheist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you thought, Felix, of doing what you promised me?&rdquo; asked Celeste,
      as soon as Madame Colleville had left them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Celeste,&rdquo; replied Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to have broken his word!&rdquo; she cried, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to have kept it would have been a profanation,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;I love
      you so deeply, with a tenderness so little proof against your wishes, that
      I promised a thing contrary to my conscience. Conscience, Celeste, is our
      treasure, our strength, our mainstay. How can you ask me to go into a
      church and kneel at the feet of a priest, in whom I can see only a man?
      You would despise me if I obeyed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, my dear Felix, you refuse to go to church,&rdquo; said Celeste, casting
      a tearful glance at the man she loved. &ldquo;If I were your wife you would let
      me go alone? You do not love me as I love you! for, alas! I have a feeling
      in my heart for an atheist contrary to that which God commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An atheist!&rdquo; cried Felix. &ldquo;Oh, no! Listen to me, Celeste. There is
      certainly a God; I believe in that; but I have higher ideas of Him than
      those of your priests; I do not wish to bring Him down to my level; I want
      to rise to Him. I listen to the voice He has put within me,&mdash;a voice
      which honest men call conscience, and I strive not to darken that divine
      ray as it comes to me. For instance, I will never harm others; I will do
      nothing against the commandments of universal morality, which was that of
      Confucius, Moses, Pythagoras, Socrates, as well as of Jesus Christ. I will
      stand in the presence of God; my actions shall be my prayers; I will never
      be false in word or deed; never will I do a base or shameful thing. Those
      are the precepts I have learned from my virtuous father, and which I
      desire to bequeath to my children. All the good that I can do I shall try
      to accomplish, even if I have to suffer for it. What can you ask more of a
      man than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This profession of the Phellion faith caused Celeste to sadly shake her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read attentively,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Imitation of Jesus Christ.&rsquo; Strive
      to convert yourself to the holy Catholic, apostolic, and Roman Church, and
      you will see how empty your words are. Hear me, Felix; marriage is not,
      the Church says, the affair of a day, the mere satisfaction of our own
      desires; it is made for eternity. What! shall we be united day and night,
      shall we form one flesh, one word, and yet have two languages, two faiths
      in our heart, and a cause of perpetual dissension? Would you condemn me to
      weep tears over the state of your soul,&mdash;tears that I must ever
      conceal from you? Could I address myself in peace to God when I see his
      arm stretched out in wrath against you? Must my children inherit the blood
      of a deist and his convictions? Oh! God, what misery for a wife! No, no,
      these ideas are intolerable. Felix! be of my faith, for I cannot share
      yours. Do not put a gulf between us. If you loved me, you would already
      have read &lsquo;The Imitation of Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Phellion class, sons of the &ldquo;Constitutionnel,&rdquo; dislike the priestly
      mind. Felix had the imprudence to reply to this sort of prayer from the
      depths of an ardent heart:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are repeating, Celeste, the lessons your confessor teaches you;
      nothing, believe me, is more fatal to happiness than the interference of
      priests in a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Celeste, wounded to the quick, for love alone inspired her,
      &ldquo;you do not love! The voice of my heart is not in unison with yours! You
      have not understood me, because you have not listened to me; but I forgive
      you, for you know not what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrapped herself in solemn silence, and Felix went to the window and
      drummed upon the panes,&mdash;music familiar to those who have indulged in
      poignant reflections. Felix was, in fact, presenting the following
      delicate and curious questions to the Phellion conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste is a rich heiress, and, in yielding against the voice of natural
      religion, to her ideas, I should have in view the making of what is
      certainly an advantageous marriage,&mdash;an infamous act. I ought not, as
      father of a family, to allow the priesthood to have an influence in my
      home. If I yield to-day, I do a weak act, which will be followed by many
      others equally pernicious to the authority of a husband and father. All
      this is unworthy of a philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to his beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste, I entreat you on my knees,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to mingle that which
      the law, in its wisdom, has separated. We live in two worlds,&mdash;society
      and heaven. Each has its own way of salvation; but as to society, is it
      not obeying God to obey the laws? Christ said: &lsquo;Render unto Caesar that
      which is Caesar&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Caesar is the body politic. Dear, let us forget our
      little quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little quarrel!&rdquo; cried the young enthusiast; &ldquo;I want you to have my whole
      heart as I want to have the whole of yours; and you make it into two
      parts! Is not that an evil? You forget that marriage is a sacrament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your priesthood have turned your head,&rdquo; exclaimed the mathematician,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Phellion,&rdquo; said Celeste, interrupting him hastily, &ldquo;enough of
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point of the quarrel that Theodose considered it judicious
      to enter the room. He found Celeste pale, and the young professor as
      anxious as a lover should be who has just irritated his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the word &lsquo;enough&rsquo;; then something is too much?&rdquo; he said,
      inquiringly, looking in turn from Celeste to Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking religion,&rdquo; replied Felix, &ldquo;and I was saying to
      mademoiselle how dangerous ecclesiastical influence is in the bosom of
      families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not the point, monsieur,&rdquo; said Celeste, sharply; &ldquo;it was to know
      if husband and wife could be of one heart when the one is an atheist and
      the other Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can there be such a thing as atheists?&rdquo; cried Theodose, with all the
      signs of extreme wonderment. &ldquo;Could a true Catholic marry a Protestant?
      There is no safety possible for a married pair unless they have perfect
      conformity in the matter of religious opinions. I, who come from the
      Comtat, of a family which counts a pope among its ancestors&mdash;for our
      arms are: gules, a key argent, with supporters, a monk holding a church,
      and a pilgrim with a staff, or, and the motto, &lsquo;I open, I shut&rsquo;&mdash;I
      am, of course, intensely dogmatic on such points. But in these days,
      thanks to our modern system of education, it does not seem to me strange
      that religion should be called into question. I myself would never marry a
      Protestant, had she millions, even if I loved her distractedly. Faith is a
      thing that cannot be tampered with. &lsquo;Una fides, unus Dominus,&rsquo; that is my
      device in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear that!&rdquo; cried Celeste, triumphantly, looking at Felix Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not openly devout,&rdquo; continued la Peyrade. &ldquo;I go to mass at six every
      morning, that I may not be observed; I fast on Fridays; I am, in short, a
      son of the Church, and I would not undertake any serious enterprise
      without prayer, after the ancient fashion of our ancestors; but no one is
      able to notice my religion. A singular thing happened to our family during
      the Revolution of 1789, which attached us more closely than ever to our
      holy mother the Church. A poor young lady of the elder branch of the
      Peyrades, who owned the little estate of la Peyrade,&mdash;for we
      ourselves are Peyrades of Canquoelle, but the two branches inherit from
      one another,&mdash;well, this young lady married, six years before the
      Revolution, a barrister who, after the fashion of the times, was
      Voltairean, that is to say, an unbeliever, or, if you choose, a deist. He
      took up all the revolutionary ideas, and practised the charming rites that
      you know of in the worship of the goddess Reason. He came into our part of
      the country imbued with the ideas of the Convention, and fanatical about
      them. His wife was very handsome; he compelled her to play the part of
      Liberty; and the poor unfortunate creature went mad. She died insane!
      Well, as things are going now it looks as if we might have another 1793.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This history, invented on the spot, made such an impression on Celeste&rsquo;s
      fresh and youthful imagination that she rose, bowed to the young men and
      hastened to her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, why did you tell her that?&rdquo; cried Felix, struck to the
      heart by the cold look the young girl, affecting profound indifference,
      cast upon him. She fancied herself transformed into a goddess of Reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What were you talking about?&rdquo; asked Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my indifference to religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great sore of this century,&rdquo; replied Theodose, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Madame Colleville, appearing in a toilet of much taste.
      &ldquo;But what is the matter with my poor daughter? She is crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crying? madame,&rdquo; exclaimed Felix; &ldquo;please tell her that I will study &lsquo;The
      Imitation of Christ&rsquo; at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix left the house with Theodose and Flavie, whose arm the barrister
      pressed to let her know he would explain in the carriage the apparent
      dementia of the young professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Madame Colleville and Celeste, Colleville and Theodose were
      entering the Thuilliers&rsquo; apartment to dine there. Theodose and Flavie took
      Thuillier into the garden, where the former said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good friend! you will have the cross within a week. Our charming
      friend here will tell you about our visit to the Comtesse du Bruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Theodose left Thuillier, having caught sight of Desroches in the act
      of being brought by Mademoiselle Thuillier into the garden; he went,
      driven by a terrible and glacial presentiment, to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Desroches in his ear, &ldquo;I have come to see if you
      can procure at once twenty-five thousand francs plus two thousand six
      hundred and eighty for costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acting for Cerizet?&rdquo; asked the barrister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet has put all the papers into the hands of Louchard, and you know
      what you have to expect if arrested. Is Cerizet wrong in thinking you have
      twenty-five thousand francs in your desk? He says you offered them to him
      and he thinks it only natural not to leave them in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for taking the step, my good friend,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;I have
      been expecting this attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; replied Desroches, &ldquo;you have made an utter fool of
      him, and he is furious. The scamp will stop at nothing to get his revenge
      upon you&mdash;for he&rsquo;ll lose everything if he forces you to fling your
      barrister&rsquo;s gown, as they say, to the nettles and go to prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Theodose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pay him. But even so, there will still
      be five notes of mine in his hands, for five thousand francs each; what
      does he mean to do with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! after the affair of this morning, I can&rsquo;t tell you; my client is a
      crafty, mangy cur, and he is sure to have his little plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Desroches,&rdquo; said Theodose, taking the hard, unyielding
      attorney round the waist, &ldquo;those papers are in your hands, are not they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you pay them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then. Be at my office at nine o&rsquo;clock; I&rsquo;ll receive the money
      and give you your notes; <i>but</i>, at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, they will
      be in the sheriff&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, then, at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; repeated Desroches, whose glance had taken in the whole
      family, then assembled in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste, with red eyes, was talking to her godmother; Colleville and
      Brigitte, Flavie and Thuillier were on the steps of the broad portico
      leading to the entrance-hall. Desroches remarked to Theodose, who followed
      him to the door:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can pay off those notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a single glance the shrewd attorney had comprehended the whole scheme
      of the barrister.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. ONE OF CERIZET&rsquo;S FEMALE CLIENTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, at daybreak, Theodose went to the office of the banker
      of the poor, to see the effect produced upon his enemy by the punctual
      payment of the night before, and to make another effort to get rid of his
      hornet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Cerizet standing up, in conference with a woman, and he received
      an imperative sign to keep at a distance and not to interrupt the
      interview. The barrister was therefore reduced to conjectures as to the
      importance of this woman, an importance revealed by the eager look on the
      face of the lender &ldquo;by the little week.&rdquo; Theodose had a presentiment,
      though a very vague one, that the upshot of this conference would have
      some influence on Cerizet&rsquo;s own arrangements, for he suddenly beheld on
      that crafty countenance the change produced by a dawning hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear mamma Cardinal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my good monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be decided&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These beginnings, or these ends of sentences were the only gleams of light
      that the animated conversation, carried on in the lowest tones with lip to
      ear and ear to lip, conveyed to the motionless witness, whose attention
      was fixed on Madame Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Cardinal was one of Cerizet&rsquo;s earliest clients; she peddled fish.
      If Parisians know these creations peculiar to their soil, foreigners have
      no suspicion of their existence; and Mere Cardinal&mdash;technologically
      speaking, of course, deserved all the interest she excited in Theodose. So
      many women of her species may be met with in the streets that the
      passers-by give them no more attention than they give to the three
      thousand pictures of the Salon. But as she stood in Cerizet&rsquo;s office the
      Cardinal had all the value of an isolated masterpiece; she was a complete
      and perfect type of her species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was mounted on muddy sabots; but her feet, carefully wrapped in
      gaiters, were still further protected by stout and thick-ribbed stockings.
      Her cotton gown, adorned with a glounce of mud, bore the imprint of the
      strap which supported the fish-basket. Her principal garment was a shawl
      of what was called &ldquo;rabbit&rsquo;s-hair cashmere,&rdquo; the two ends of which were
      knotted behind, above her bustle&mdash;for we must needs employ a
      fashionable word to express the effect produced by the transversal
      pressure of the basket upon her petticoats, which projected below it, in
      shape like a cabbage. A printed cotton neckerchief, of the coarsest
      description, gave to view a red neck, ribbed and lined like the surface of
      a pond where people have skated. Her head was covered in a yellow silk
      foulard, twined in a manner that was rather picturesque. Short and stout,
      and ruddy of skin, Mere Cardinal probably drank her little drop of brandy
      in the morning. She had once been handsome. The Halle had formerly
      reproached her, in the boldness of its figurative speech, for doing &ldquo;a
      double day&rsquo;s-work in the twenty-four.&rdquo; Her voice, in order to reduce
      itself to the diapason of ordinary conversation, was obliged to stifle its
      sound as other voices do in a sick-room; but at such times it came thick
      and muffled, from a throat accustomed to send to the farthest recesses of
      the highest garret the names of the fish in their season. Her nose, a la
      Roxelane, her well-cut lips, her blue eyes, and all that formerly made up
      her beauty, was now buried in folds of vigorous flesh which told of the
      habits and occupations of an outdoor life. The stomach and bosom were
      distinguished for an amplitude worthy of Rubens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to make me lie in the straw?&rdquo; she said to Cerizet. &ldquo;What do I
      care for the Toupilliers? Ain&rsquo;t I a Toupillier myself? What do you want to
      do with them, those Toupilliers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This savage outburst was hastily repressed by Cerizet, who uttered a
      prolonged &ldquo;Hush-sh!&rdquo; such as all conspirators obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and find out all you can about it, and come back to me,&rdquo; said
      Cerizet, pushing the woman toward the door, and whispering, as he did so,
      a few words in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Theodose to Cerizet, &ldquo;you have got your
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Cerizet &ldquo;we have measured our claws, they are the same
      length, the same strength, and the same sharpness. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to tell Dutocq that you received, last night, twenty-five thousand
      francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear friend, not a word, if you love me!&rdquo; cried Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Theodose. &ldquo;I must know, once for all, what you want. I am
      positively determined not to remain twenty-four hours longer on the
      gridiron where you have got me. Cheat Dutocq if you will; I am utterly
      indifferent to that; but I intend that you and I shall come to an
      understanding. It is a fortune that I have paid you, twenty-five thousand
      francs, and you must have earned ten thousand more in your business; it is
      enough to make you an honest man. Cerizet, if you will leave me in peace,
      if you won&rsquo;t prevent my marriage with Mademoiselle Colleville, I shall
      certainly be king&rsquo;s attorney-general, or something of that kind in Paris.
      You can&rsquo;t do better than make sure of an influence in that sphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are my conditions; and they won&rsquo;t allow of discussion; you can take
      them or leave them. You will obtain for me the lease of Thuillier&rsquo;s new
      house for eighteen years, and I&rsquo;ll hand you back one of your five notes
      cancelled, and you shall not find me any longer in your way. But you will
      have to settle with Dutocq for the remaining four notes. You got the
      better of <i>me</i>, and I know Dutocq hasn&rsquo;t the force to stand against
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree to that, provided you&rsquo;ll pay a rent of forty-eight thousand
      francs for the house, the last year in advance, and begin the lease in
      October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I shall not give for the last year&rsquo;s rent more than forty-three
      thousand francs; your note will pay the remainder. I have seen the house,
      and examined it. It suits me very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last condition,&rdquo; said Theodose; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll help me against Dutocq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll cook him brown yourself; he doesn&rsquo;t need any
      basting from me; he&rsquo;ll give out his gravy fast enough. But you ought to be
      reasonable. The poor fellow can&rsquo;t pay off the last fifteen thousand francs
      due on his practice, and you should reflect that fifteen thousand francs
      would certainly buy back your notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; give me two weeks to get your lease&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not a day later than Monday next! Tuesday your notes will be in
      Louchard&rsquo;s hands; unless you pay them Monday, or Thuillier signs the
      lease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monday, so be it!&rdquo; said Theodose; &ldquo;are we friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be Monday,&rdquo; responded Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Monday you&rsquo;ll pay for my dinner,&rdquo; said Theodose, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at the Rocher de Cancale, if I have the lease. Dutocq shall be there&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      all be there&mdash;ah! it is long since I&rsquo;ve had a good laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodose and Cerizet shook hands, saying, reciprocally:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had not calmed down so suddenly without reasons. In the first
      place, as Desroches once said, &ldquo;Bile does not facilitate business,&rdquo; and
      the usurer had too well seen the justice of that remark not to coolly
      resolve to get something out of his position, and to squeeze the jugular
      vein of the crafty Provencal until he strangled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fair revenge,&rdquo; Desroches said to him; &ldquo;mind you extract its
      quintessence. You hold that fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For ten years past Cerizet had seen men growing rich by practising the
      trade of principal tenant. The principal tenant is, in Paris, to the
      owners of houses what farmers are to country landlords. All Paris has seen
      one of its great tailors, building at his own cost, on the famous site of
      Frascati, one of the most sumptuous of houses, and paying, as principal
      tenant, fifty thousand francs a year for the ground rent of the house,
      which, at the end of nineteen years&rsquo; lease, was to become the property of
      the owner of the land. In spite of the costs of construction, which were
      something like seven hundred thousand francs, the profits of those
      nineteen years proved, in the end, very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet, always on the watch for business, had examined the chances for
      gain offered by the situation of the house which Thuillier had <i>stolen</i>,&mdash;as
      he said to Desroches,&mdash;and he had seen the possibility of letting it
      for sixty thousand at the end of six years. There were four shops, two on
      each side, for it stood on a boulevard corner. Cerizet expected,
      therefore, to get clear ten thousand a year for a dozen years, allowing
      for eventualities and sundries attendant on renewal of leases. He
      therefore proposed to himself to sell his money-lending business to the
      widow Poiret and Cadenet for ten thousand francs; he already possessed
      thirty thousand; and the two together would enable him to pay the last
      year&rsquo;s rent in advance, which house-owners in Paris usually demand as a
      guarantee from a principal tenant on a long lease. Cerizet had spent a
      happy night; he fell asleep in a glorious dream; he saw himself in a fair
      way to do an honest business, and to become a bourgeois like Thuillier,
      like Minard, and so many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had a waking of which he did not dream. He found Fortune standing
      before him, and emptying her gilded horns of plenty at his feet in the
      person of Madame Cardinal. He had always had a liking for the woman, and
      had promised her for a year past the necessary sum to buy a donkey and a
      little cart, so that she could carry on her business on a large scale, and
      go from Paris to the suburbs. Madame Cardinal, widow of a porter in the
      corn-market, had an only daughter, whose beauty Cerizet had heard of from
      some of the mother&rsquo;s cronies. Olympe Cardinal was about thirteen years of
      age at the time, 1837, when Cerizet began his system of loans in the
      quarter; and with a view to an infamous libertinism, he had paid great
      attention to the mother, whom he rescued from utter misery, hoping to make
      Olympe his mistress. But suddenly, in 1838, the girl left her mother, and
      &ldquo;made her life,&rdquo; to use an expression by which the lower classes in Paris
      describe the abuse of the most precious gifts of nature and youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To look for a girl in Paris is to look for a smelt in the Seine; nothing
      but chance can throw her into the net. The chance came. Mere Cardinal, who
      to entertain a neighbor had taken her to the Bobino theatre, recognized in
      the leading lady her own daughter, whom the first comedian had held under
      his control for three years. The mother, gratified at first at beholding
      her daughter in a fine gown of gold brocade, her hair dressed like that of
      a duchess, and wearing open-worked stockings, satin shoes, and receiving
      the plaudits of the audience, ended by screaming out from her seat in the
      gallery:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall soon hear of me, murderer of your own mother! I&rsquo;ll know whether
      miserable strolling-players have the right to come and debauch young girls
      of sixteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited at the stage-door to capture her daughter, but the first
      comedian and the leading lady had no doubt jumped across the footlights
      and left the theatre with the audience, instead of issuing by the
      stage-door, where Madame Cardinal and her crony, Mere Mahoudeau, made an
      infernal rumpus, which two municipal guards were called upon to pacify.
      Those august personages, before whom the two women lowered the diapason of
      their voices, called the mother&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the girl was
      of legitimate theatrical age, and that instead of screaming at the door
      after the director, she could summon him before the justice-of-peace, or
      the police-court, whichever she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Madame Cardinal intended to consult Cerizet, in view of the
      fact that he was a clerk in the office of the justice-of-peace; but,
      before reaching his lair in the rue des Poules, she was met by the porter
      of a house in which an uncle of hers, a certain Toupillier, was living,
      who told her that the old man hadn&rsquo;t probably two days to live, being then
      in the last extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you expect me to help it?&rdquo; replied the widow Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We count on you, my dear Madame Cardinal; we know you won&rsquo;t forget the
      good advice we&rsquo;ll give you. Here&rsquo;s the thing. Lately, your poor uncle, not
      being able to stir round, has trusted me to go and collect the rents of
      his house, rue Notre-Dame de Nazareth, and the arrears of his dividends at
      the Treasury, which come to eighteen hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the widow Cardinal&rsquo;s eyes were becoming fixed instead of
      wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; continued Perrache, a hump-backed little concierge; &ldquo;and,
      seeing that you are the only person who ever thinks about him, and that
      you come and see him sometimes, and bring him fish, perhaps he may make a
      bequest in your favor. My wife, who has been nursing him for the last few
      days since he has been so ill, spoke to him of you, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have
      you told about his illness. But now, don&rsquo;t you see, it is high time you
      should show yourself there. It is pretty nigh two months since he has been
      able to attend to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well think, you old thief,&rdquo; replied Madame Cardinal, hurrying at
      top speed toward the rue Honore-Chevalier, where her uncle lived in a
      wretched garret, &ldquo;that the hair would grow on my hand before I could ever
      imagine that. What! my uncle Toupillier rich! the old pauper of the church
      of Saint-Sulpice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the porter, &ldquo;but he fed well. He went to bed every night
      with his best friend, a big bottle of Roussillon. My wife has tasted it,
      though he told us it was common stuff. The wine-merchant in the rue des
      Canettes supplies it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word about all this,&rdquo; said the widow, when she parted from
      the man who had given her the information. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care and remember
      you&mdash;if anything comes of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toupillier, former drum-major in the French Guards, had been for the two
      years preceding 1789 in the service of the Church as beadle of
      Saint-Sulpice. The Revolution deprived him of that post, and he then
      dropped down into a state of abject misery. He was even obliged to take to
      the profession of model, for he <i>enjoyed</i>, as they say, a fine
      physique. When public worship was restored, he took up his beadle&rsquo;s staff
      once more; but in 1816 he was dismissed, as much on account of his
      immorality as for his political opinions. Nevertheless, he was allowed to
      stay about the door of the church and distribute the holy water. Later, an
      unfortunate affair, which we shall presently mention, made him lose even
      that position; but, still finding means to keep to the sanctuary, he
      obtained permission to be allowed as a pauper in the porch. At this period
      of life, being then seventy-two years of age, he made himself ninety-six,
      and began the profession of centenarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all Paris it was impossible to find another such beard and head of hair
      as Toupillier&rsquo;s. As he walked he appeared bent double; he held a stick in
      his shaking hand,&mdash;a hand that was covered with lichen, like a
      granite rock, and with the other he held out the classic hat with a broad
      brim, filthy and battered, into which, however, there fell abundant alms.
      His legs were swathed in rags and bandages, and his feet shuffled along in
      miserable overshoes of woven mat-weed, inside of which he had fastened
      excellent cork soles. He washed his face with certain compounds, which
      gave it an appearance of forms of illness, and he played the senility of a
      centenarian to the life. He reckoned himself a hundred years old in 1830,
      at which time his actual age was eighty; he was the head of the paupers of
      Saint-Sulpice, the master of the place, and all those who came to beg
      under the arcades of the church, safe from the persecutions of the police
      and beneath the protection of the beadle and the giver of holy water, were
      forced to pay him a sort of tithe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a new heir, a bridegroom, or some godfather left the church, saying,
      &ldquo;Here, this is for all of you; don&rsquo;t torment any of my party,&rdquo; Toupillier,
      appointed by the beadle to receive these alms, pocketed three-fourths, and
      distributed only the remaining quarter among his henchmen, whose tribute
      amounted to a sou a day. Money and wine were his last two passions; but he
      regulated the latter and gave himself up to the former, with neglecting
      his personal comfort. He drank at night only, after his dinner, and for
      twenty years he slept in the arms of drunkenness, his last mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early morning he was at his post with all his faculties. From then
      until his dinner, which he took at Pere Lathuile&rsquo;s (made famous by
      Charlet), he gnawed crusts of bread by way of nourishment; and he gnawed
      them artistically, with an air of resignation which earned him abundant
      alms. The beadle and the giver of holy water, with whom he may have had
      some private understanding, would say of him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of the worthy poor of the church; he used to know the rector
      Languet, who built Saint-Sulpice; he was for twenty years beadle of the
      church before the Revolution, and he is now over a hundred years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little biography, well known to all the pious attendants of the
      church, was, of course, the best of his advertisements, and no hat was so
      well lined as his. He bought his house in 1826, and began to invest his
      money in the Funds in 1830. From the value of the two investments he must
      have made something like six thousand francs a year, and probably turned
      them over by usury, after Cerizet&rsquo;s own fashion; for the sum he paid for
      the house was forty thousand francs, while his investment in 1830 was
      forty-eight thousand more. His niece, deceived by the old man as much as
      he deceived the functionaries and the pious souls of the church, believed
      him the most miserable of paupers, and when she had any fish that were
      spoiling she sometimes took them to the aged beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, she now felt it her right to get what she could in return
      for her pity and her liberality to an uncle who was likely to have a crowd
      of collateral heirs; she herself being the third and last Toupillier
      daughter. She had four brothers, and her father, a porter with a
      hand-cart, had told her, in her childhood, of three aunts and four uncles,
      who all led an existence of the baser sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      After inspecting the sick man, she went, at full speed, to consult
      Cerizet, telling him, in the first place, how she had found her daughter,
      and then the reasons and indications which made her think that her uncle
      Toupillier was hoarding a pile of gold in his mattress. Mere Cardinal did
      not feel herself strong enough to seize upon the property, legally or
      illegally, and she therefore came to confide in Cerizet and get his
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, the banker of the poor, like other scavengers, had, at last,
      found diamonds in the slime in which he had paddled for the last four
      years, being always on the watch for some such chance,&mdash;a chance,
      they say, occasionally met with in the purlieus, which give birth to
      heiresses in sabots. This was the secret of his unexpected gentleness to
      la Peyrade, the man whose ruin he had vowed. It is easy to imagine the
      anxiety with which he awaited the return of Madame Cardinal, to whom this
      wily schemer of nefarious plots had given means to verify her suspicions
      as to the existence of the hoarded treasure, promising her complete
      success if she would trust him to obtain for her so rich a harvest. He was
      not the man to shrink from a crime, above all, when he saw that others
      could commit it, while he obtained the benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur,&rdquo; cried the fishwife, entering Cerizet&rsquo;s den with a face
      as much inflamed by cupidity as by the haste of her movements, &ldquo;my uncle
      sleeps on more than a hundred thousand francs in gold, and I am certain
      that those Perraches, by dint of nursing him, have smelt the rat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shared among forty heirs that won&rsquo;t be much to each,&rdquo; said Cerizet.
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Mere Cardinal: I&rsquo;ll marry your daughter; give her your
      uncle&rsquo;s gold, and I&rsquo;ll guarantee to you a life-interest in the house and
      the dividends from the money in the Funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t run any risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, then,&rdquo; said the widow Cardinal, holding out her hand to her
      future son-in-law. &ldquo;Six thousand francs a year; hey! what a fine life I&rsquo;ll
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a son-in-law like me!&rdquo; added Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be a bourgeoisie of Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed Cerizet, after a pause, &ldquo;I must study the ground. Don&rsquo;t
      leave your uncle alone a minute; tell the Perraches that you expect a
      doctor. I&rsquo;ll be the doctor, and when I get there you must seem not to know
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sly, you old rogue,&rdquo; said Madame Cardinal, with a punch on
      Cerizet&rsquo;s stomach by way of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Cerizet, dressed in black, disguised by a rusty wig and an
      artificially painted physiognomy, arrived at the house in the rue
      Honore-Chevalier in the regulation cabriolet. He asked the porter to tell
      him how to find the lodging of an old beggar named Toupillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is monsieur the doctor whom Madame Cardinal expects?&rdquo; asked Perrache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had no doubt reflected on the gravity of the affair he was
      undertaking, for he avoided giving an answer to that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way?&rdquo; he said, turning at random to one side of the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Perrache, who then took him to the back stairs of
      the house, which led up to the wretched attic occupied by the pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remained for the inquisitive porter to do but to question the
      driver of the cabriolet; to which employment we will leave him, while we
      pursue our own inquiries elsewhere.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       THE DIFFICULTIES THAT CROP UP IN THE EASIEST OF THEFTS
</pre>
    <p>
      The house in which Toupillier lived is one of those which have lost half
      their depth, owing to the straightening of the line of the street, the rue
      Honore-Chevalier being one of the narrowest in the Saint-Sulpice quarter.
      The owner, forbidden by the law to repair it, or to add new storeys, was
      compelled to let the wretched building in the condition in which he bought
      it. It consisted of a first storey above the ground-floor, surmounted by
      garrets, with two small wings running back on either side. The courtyard
      thus formed ended in a garden planted with trees, which was always rented
      to the occupant of the first floor. This garden, separated by an iron
      railing from the courtyard, would have allowed a rich owner to sell the
      front buildings to the city, and to build a new house upon the courtyard;
      but the whole of the first floor was let on an eighteen years&rsquo; lease to a
      mysterious personage, about whom neither the official policing of the
      concierge nor the curiosity of the other tenants could find anything to
      censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tenant, now seventy years of age, had built, in 1829, an outer
      stairway, leading from the right wing of the first floor to the garden, so
      that he could get there without going through the courtyard. Half the
      ground-floor was occupied by a book-stitcher, who for the last ten years
      had used the stable and coach-house for workshops. A book-binder occupied
      the other half. The binder and the stitcher lived, each of them, in half
      the garret rooms over the front building on the street. The garrets above
      the rear wings were occupied, the one on the right by the mysterious
      tenant, the one on the left by Toupillier, who paid a hundred francs a
      year for it, and reached it by a dark staircase, lighted by small round
      windows. The porte-cochere was made in the circular form indispensable in
      a street so narrow that two carriages cannot pass in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet laid hold of the rope which served as a baluster, to climb the
      species of ladder leading to the room where the so-called beggar was
      dying,&mdash;a room in which the odious spectacle of pretended pauperism
      was being played. In Paris, everything that is done for a purpose is
      thoroughly done. Would-be paupers are as clever at mounting their disguise
      as shopkeepers in preparing their show-windows, or sham rich men in
      obtaining credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor had never been swept; the bricks had disappeared beneath layers
      of dirt, dust, dried mud, and any and every thing thrown down by
      Toupillier. A miserable stove of cast-iron, the pipe of which entered a
      crumbling chimney, was the most apparent piece of furniture in this hovel.
      In an alcove stood a bed, with tester and valence of green serge, which
      the moths had transformed into lace. The window, almost useless, had a
      heavy coating of grease upon its panes, which dispensed with the necessity
      of curtains. The whitewashed walls presented to the eye fuliginous tones,
      due to the wood and peat burned by the pauper in his stove. On the
      fireplace were a broken water-pitcher, two bottles, and a cracked plate. A
      worm-eaten chest of drawers contained his linen and decent clothes. The
      rest of the furniture consisted of a night-table of the commonest
      description, another table, worth about forty sous, and two kitchen chairs
      with the straw seats almost gone. The extremely picturesque costume of the
      centenarian pauper was hanging from a nail, and below it, on the floor,
      were the shapeless mat-weed coverings that served him for shoes, the whole
      forming, with his amorphous old hat and knotty stick, a sort of panoply of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, Cerizet gave a rapid glance at the old man, whose head lay
      on a pillow brown with grease and without a pillow-case; his angular
      profile, like those which engravers of the last century were fond of
      making out of rocks in the landscapes they engraved, was strongly defined
      in black against the green serge hangings of the tester. Toupillier, a man
      nearly six feet tall, was looking fixedly at some object at the foot of
      his bed; he did not move on hearing the groaning of the heavy door, which,
      being armed with iron bolts and a strong lock, closed his domicile
      securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he conscious?&rdquo; said Cerizet, before whom Madame Cardinal started back,
      not having recognized him till he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nearly,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out on the staircase, so that he doesn&rsquo;t hear us,&rdquo; whispered
      Cerizet. &ldquo;This is how we&rsquo;ll manage it,&rdquo; he continued, in the ear of his
      future mother-in-law. &ldquo;He is weak, but he isn&rsquo;t so very low; we have fully
      a week before us. I&rsquo;ll send you a doctor who&rsquo;ll suit us,&mdash;you
      understand? and later in the evening I&rsquo;ll bring you six poppy-heads. In
      the state he&rsquo;s in, you see, a decoction of poppy-heads will send him into
      a sound sleep. I&rsquo;ll send you a cot-bed on pretence of your sleeping in the
      room with him. We&rsquo;ll move him from one bed to the other, and when we&rsquo;ve
      found the money there won&rsquo;t be any difficulty in carrying it off. But we
      ought to know who the people are who live in this old barrack. If Perrache
      suspects, as you think, about the money, he might give an alarm, and so
      many tenants, so many spies, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for that,&rdquo; said Madame Cardinal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out already that
      Monsieur du Portail, the old man who occupies the first floor, has charge
      of an insane woman; I heard their Dutch servant-woman, Katte, calling her
      Lydie this morning. The only other servant is an old valet named Bruneau;
      he does everything, except cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the binder and the stitcher down below,&rdquo; returned Cerizet, &ldquo;they
      begin work very early in the morning&mdash;Well, anyhow, we must study the
      matter,&rdquo; he added, in the tone of a man whose plans are not yet decided.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the mayor&rsquo;s office of your arrondissement, and get Olympe&rsquo;s
      register of birth, and put up the banns. The marriage must take place a
      week from Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he goes it, the rascal!&rdquo; cried the admiring Madame Cardinal, pushing
      her formidable son-in-law by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went downstairs Cerizet was surprised to see, through one of the
      small round windows, an old man, evidently du Portail, walking in the
      garden with a very important member of the government, Comte Martial de la
      Roche-Hugon. He stopped in the courtyard when he reached it, as if to
      examine the old house, built in the reign of Louis XIV., the yellow walls
      of which, though of freestone, were bent like the elderly beggar they
      contained. Then he looked at the workshops, and counted the workmen. The
      house was otherwise as silent as a cloister. Being observed himself,
      Cerizet departed, thinking over in his mind the various difficulties that
      might arise in extracting the sum hidden beneath the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry off all that gold at night?&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;why, those
      porters will be on the watch, and twenty persons might see us! It is hard
      work to carry even twenty-five thousand francs of gold on one&rsquo;s person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Societies have two goals of perfection; the first is a state of
      civilization in which morality equally infused and pervasive does not
      admit even the idea of crime; the Jesuits reached that point, formerly
      presented by the primitive Church. The second is the state of another
      civilization in which the supervision of citizens over one another makes
      crime impossible. The end which modern society has placed before itself is
      the latter; namely, that in which a crime presents such difficulties that
      a man must abandon all reasoning in order to commit it. In fact,
      iniquities which the law cannot reach are not left actually unpunished,
      for social judgment is even more severe than that of courts. If a man like
      Minoret, the post-master at Nemours [see &ldquo;Ursule Mirouet&rdquo;] suppresses a
      will and no one witnesses the act, the crime is traced home to him by the
      watchfulness of virtue as surely as a robbery is followed up by the
      detective police. No wrong-doing passes actually unperceived; and wherever
      a lesion in rectitude takes place the scar remains. Things can be no more
      made to disappear than men; so carefully, in Paris especially, are
      articles and objects ticketed and numbered, houses watched, streets
      observed, places spied upon. To live at ease, crime must have a sanction
      like that of the Bourse; like that conceded by Cerizet&rsquo;s clients; who
      never complained of his usury, and, indeed, would have been troubled in
      mind if their flayer were not in his den of a Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame Perrache, the porter&rsquo;s wife, as he
      passed her lodge, &ldquo;how do you find him, that friend of God, that poor
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the doctor,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, who now decidedly declined that
      role. &ldquo;I am Madame Cardinal&rsquo;s business man. I have just advised her to
      have a cot-bed put up, so as to nurse her uncle night and day; though,
      perhaps, she will have to get a regular nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can help her,&rdquo; said Madame Perrache. &ldquo;I nurse women in childbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange all that. Who is
      the tenant on your first floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur du Portail. He has lodged here these thirty years. He is a man
      with a good income, monsieur; highly respectable, and elderly. You know
      people who invest in the Funds live on their incomes. He used to be in
      business. But it is more than eleven years now since he has been trying to
      restore the reason of a daughter of one of his friends, Mademoiselle Lydie
      de la Peyrade. She has the best advice, I can tell you; the very first
      doctors in Paris; only this morning they had a consultation. But so far
      nothing has cured her; and they have to watch her pretty close; for
      sometimes she gets up and walks at night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Lydie de la Peyrade!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet; &ldquo;are you sure of
      the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Madame Katte, her nurse, who also does the cooking, call her
      so a thousand times, monsieur; though, generally, neither Monsieur
      Bruneau, the valet, nor Madame Katte say much. It&rsquo;s like talking to the
      wall to try and get any information out of them. We have been porters here
      these twenty years and we&rsquo;ve never found out anything about Monsieur du
      Portail yet. More than that, monsieur, he owns the little house alongside;
      you see the double door from here. Well, he can go out that way and
      receive his company too, and we know nothing about it. Our owner doesn&rsquo;t
      know anything more than we do; when people ring at that door, Monsieur
      Bruneau goes and opens it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t see the gentleman who is talking with him in the garden
      go by this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! no, that I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Cerizet as he got into the cabriolet, &ldquo;she must be the
      daughter of that uncle of Theodose. I wonder if du Portail can be the
      secret benefactor who sent money from time to time to that rascal? Suppose
      I send an anonymous letter to the old fellow, warning him of the danger
      the barrister runs from those notes for twenty-five thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the cot-bed had arrived for Madame Cardinal, to whom the
      inquisitive portress offered her services to bring her something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to see the rector?&rdquo; Madame Cardinal inquired of her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had noticed that the arrival of the bed seemed to draw him from his
      somnolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want wine!&rdquo; replied the pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel now, Pere Toupillier?&rdquo; asked Madame Perrache, in a
      coaxing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I want wine,&rdquo; repeated the old man, with an energetic
      insistence scarcely to be expected of his feebleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must first find out if it is good for you, uncle,&rdquo; said Madame
      Cardinal, soothingly. &ldquo;Wait till the doctor comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor! I won&rsquo;t have a doctor!&rdquo; cried Toupillier; &ldquo;and you, what are you
      doing here? I don&rsquo;t want anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good uncle, I came to know if you&rsquo;d like something tasty. I&rsquo;ve got
      some nice fresh soles&mdash;hey! a bit of fried sole, with a squeeze of
      lemon on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your fish, indeed!&rdquo; cried Toupillier; &ldquo;all rotten! That last you brought
      me, more than six weeks ago, it is there in the cupboard; you can take it
      away with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! how ungrateful sick men are!&rdquo; whispered the widow Cardinal to
      Perrache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, to exhibit solicitude, she arranged the pillow under the
      patient&rsquo;s head, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! uncle, don&rsquo;t you feel better like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; shouted Toupillier, angrily; &ldquo;I want no one here; I want
      wine; leave me in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry, little uncle; we&rsquo;ll fetch you some wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number six wine, rue des Canettes,&rdquo; cried the pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Madame Cardinal; &ldquo;but let me count out my coppers.
      I want to get something better for you than that kind of wine; for, don&rsquo;t
      you see, an uncle, he&rsquo;s a kind of father, and one shouldn&rsquo;t mind what one
      does for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she sat down, with her legs apart, on one of the dilapidated
      chairs, and poured into her apron the contents of her pockets, namely: a
      knife, her snuff-box, two pawn-tickets, some crusts of bread, and a
      handful of copper, from which she extracted a few silver bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exhibition, intended to prove her generous and eager devotion, had no
      result. Toupillier seemed not to notice it. Exhausted by the feverish
      energy with which he had demanded his favorite remedy, he made an effort
      to change his position, and, with his back turned to his two nurses, he
      again muttered: &ldquo;Wine! wine!&rdquo; after which nothing more was heard of him
      but a stentorous breathing, that plainly showed the state of his lungs,
      which were beginning to congest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must go and fetch his wine!&rdquo; said the Cardinal, restoring to
      her pockets, with some ill-humor, the cargo she had just pulled out of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;&rdquo; began Madame Perrache, always ready to
      offer her services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishwife hesitated for a moment; then, reflecting that something might
      be got out of a conversation with the wine-merchant, and sure, moreover,
      that as long as Toupillier lay on his gold she could safely leave him
      alone with the portress, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Madame Perrache, but I&rsquo;d better make acquaintance with his
      trades-folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, having spied behind the night-table a dirty bottle which might hold
      about two quarts,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say the rue des Canelles?&rdquo; she inquired of the portress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corner of the rue Guisarde,&rdquo; replied Madame Perrache. &ldquo;Monsieur Legrelu,
      a tall, fine man with big whiskers and no hair.&rdquo; Then, lowering her voice,
      she added: &ldquo;His number-six wine, you know, is Roussillon, and the best,
      too. However, the wine-merchant knows; it is enough if you tell him you
      have come from his customer, the pauper of Saint-Sulpice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to tell me anything twice,&rdquo; said the Cardinal, opening the door
      and making, as they say, a false exit. &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; she said, coming back;
      &ldquo;what does he burn in his stove, supposing I want to heat some remedy for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said the portress, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t make much provision for winter,
      and here we are in the middle of summer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not a saucepan! not a pot, even! Gracious! what a way to live. I&rsquo;ll
      have to fetch him some provisions; I hope nobody will see the things I
      bring back; I&rsquo;d be ashamed they should&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a hand-bag,&rdquo; said the portress, always ready and officious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll buy a basket,&rdquo; replied the fishwife, more anxious about what she
      expected to carry away than what she was about to bring home to the
      pauper. &ldquo;There must be some Auvergnat in the neighborhood who sells wood,&rdquo;
       she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corner of the rue Ferou; you&rsquo;ll find one there. A fine establishment,
      with logs of wood painted in a kind of an arcade all round the shop&mdash;so
      like, you&rsquo;d think they were going to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before going finally off, Madame Cardinal went through a piece of very
      deep hypocrisy. We have seen how she hesitated about leaving the portress
      alone with the sick man:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Perrache,&rdquo; she said to her, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t leave him, the poor
      darling, will you, till I get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may have been noticed that Cerizet had not decided on any definite
      course of action in the new affair he was now undertaking. The part of
      doctor, which for a moment he thought of assuming, frightened him, and he
      gave himself out, as we have seen, to Madame Perrache as the business
      agent of his accomplice. Once alone, he began to see that his original
      idea complicated with a doctor, a nurse, and a notary, presented the most
      serious difficulties. A regular will drawn in favor of Madame Cardinal was
      not a thing to be improvised in a moment. It would take some time to
      acclimatize the idea in the surly and suspicious mind of the old pauper,
      and death, which was close at hand, might play them a trick at any moment,
      and balk the most careful preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that unless a will were made the income of eight thousand
      francs on the Grand Livre and the house in the rue Notre-Dame de Nazareth
      would go to the heirs-at-law, and Madame Cardinal would get only her share
      of the property; but the abandonment of this visible portion of the
      inheritance was the surest means of laying hands on the invisible part of
      it. Besides, if the latter were secured, what hindered their returning to
      the idea of a will?
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolving, therefore, to confine the <i>operation</i> to the simplest
      terms at first, Cerizet summed them up in the manoeuvre of the
      poppy-heads, already mentioned, and he was making his way back to
      Toupillier&rsquo;s abode, armed with that single weapon of war, intending to
      give Madame Cardinal further instructions, when he met her, bearing on her
      arm the basket she had just bought; and in that basket was the sick man&rsquo;s
      panacea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried the usurer, &ldquo;is this the way you keep your watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to go out and buy him wine,&rdquo; replied the Cardinal; &ldquo;he is howling
      like a soul in hell that he wants to be at peace, and to be let alone, and
      get his wine! It is his one idea that Roussillon is good for his disease.
      Well, when he has drunk it, I dare say he will be quieter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Cerizet, sententiously; &ldquo;never contradict a sick
      man. But this wine, you know, ought to be improved; by infusing these&rdquo;
       (and lifting one of the covers of the basket he slipped in the poppies)
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll procure the poor man a good, long sleep,&mdash;five or six hours
      at least. This evening I&rsquo;ll come and see you, and nothing, I think, need
      prevent us from examining a little closer those matters of inheritance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Madame Cardinal, winking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, then,&rdquo; said Cerizet, not wishing to prolong the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a strong sense of the difficulty and danger of the affair, and was
      very reluctant to be seen in the street conversing with his accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to her uncle&rsquo;s garret, Madame Cardinal found him still in a
      state of semi-torpor; she relieved Madame Perrache, and bade her good-bye,
      going to the door to receive a supply of wood, all sawed, which she had
      ordered from the Auvergnat in the rue Ferou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into an earthen pot, which she had bought of the right size to fit upon
      the hole in the stoves of the poor where they put their soup-kettles, she
      now threw the poppies, pouring over them two-thirds of the wine she had
      brought back with her. Then she lighted a fire beneath the pot, intending
      to obtain the decoction agreed upon as quickly as possible. The crackling
      of the wood and the heat, which soon spread about the room, brought
      Toupillier out of his stupor. Seeing the stove lighted he called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is making a fire here? Do you want to burn the house down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, uncle,&rdquo; said the Cardinal, &ldquo;it is wood I bought with my own money,
      to warm your wine. The doctor doesn&rsquo;t want you to drink it cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it, that wine?&rdquo; demanded Toupillier, calming down a little at
      the thought that the fire was not burning at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must come to a boil,&rdquo; said his nurse; &ldquo;the doctor insisted upon that.
      Still, if you&rsquo;ll be good I&rsquo;ll give you half a glass of it cold, just to
      wet your whistle. I&rsquo;ll take that upon myself, but don&rsquo;t you tell the
      doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor! I won&rsquo;t have a doctor; they are all scoundrels, invented to kill
      people,&rdquo; cried Toupillier, whom the idea of drink had revived. &ldquo;Come, give
      me the wine!&rdquo; he said, in the tone of a man whose patience had come to an
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced that though this compliance would do no harm it could do no
      good, Madame Cardinal poured out half a glass, and while she gave it with
      one hand to the sick man, with the other she raised him to a sitting
      posture that he might drink it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his fleshless, eager fingers Toupillier clutched the glass, emptied
      it at a gulp, and exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a fine drop, that is! though you&rsquo;ve watered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that, uncle; I went and bought it myself of Pere Legrelu,
      and I&rsquo;ve given it you quite pure. But you let me simmer the rest; the
      doctor said I might then give you all you wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toupillier resigned himself with a shrug of the shoulders. At the end of
      fifteen minutes, the infusion being in condition to serve, Madame Cardinal
      brought him, without further appeal, a full cup of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The avidity with which the old pauper drank it down prevented him from
      noticing at first that the wine was drugged; but as he swallowed the last
      drops he tasted the sickly and nauseating flavor, and flinging the cup on
      the bed he cried out that some one was trying to poison him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison! nonsense!&rdquo; said the fishwife, pouring into her own mouth a few
      drops of that which remained in the bottle, declaring to the old man that
      if the wine did not seem to him the same as usual, it was because his
      mouth had a &ldquo;bad taste to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the dispute, which lasted some time, the narcotic began
      to take effect, and at the end of an hour the sick man was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      While idly waiting for Cerizet, an idea took possession of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
      mind. She thought that in view of their comings and goings with the
      treasure, it would be well if the vigilance of the Perrache husband and
      wife could be dulled in some manner. Consequently, after carefully
      flinging the refuse poppy-heads into the privy, she called to the
      portress:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Perrache, come up and taste his wine. Wouldn&rsquo;t you have thought to
      hear him talk he was ready to drink a cask of it? Well, a cupful satisfied
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your health!&rdquo; said the portress, touching glasses with the Cardinal, who
      was careful to have hers filled with the unboiled wine. Less accomplished
      as a gourmet than the old beggar, Madame Perrache perceived nothing in the
      insidious liquid (cold by the time she drank it) to make her suspect its
      narcotic character; on the contrary, she declared it was &ldquo;velvet,&rdquo; and
      wished that her husband were there to have a share in the treat. After a
      rather long gossip, the two women separated. Then, with the cooked meat
      she had provided for herself, and the remains of the Roussillon, Madame
      Cardinal made a repast which she finished off with a siesta. Without
      mentioning the emotions of the day, the influence of one of the most heady
      wines of the country would have sufficed to explain the soundness of her
      sleep; when she woke darkness was coming on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first care was to give a glance at her patient; his sleep was
      restless, and he was dreaming aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diamonds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;those diamonds? At my death, but not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; thought Madame Cardinal, &ldquo;that was the one thing lacking,&mdash;diamonds!
      that he should have diamonds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Toupillier seemed to be in the grasp of a violent nightmare, she
      leaned over him so as not to lose a word of his speech, hoping to gather
      from it some important revelation. At this moment a slight rap given to
      the door, from which the careful nurse had removed the key, announced the
      arrival of Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, on entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken the drug. He&rsquo;s been sound asleep these two hours; just now,
      in dreaming, he was talking of diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if we found some. These
      paupers when they set out to be rich, like to pile up everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; cried the Cardinal, suddenly, &ldquo;what made you go and tell Mere
      Perrache that you were my man of business, and that you weren&rsquo;t a doctor?
      I thought we agreed this morning that you were coming as a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet did not choose to admit that the usurpation of that title had
      seemed to him dangerous; he feared to discourage his accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw that the woman was going to propose a consultation,&rdquo; he replied,
      &ldquo;and I got out of it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Cardinal, &ldquo;they say fine minds come together;
      that was my dodge, too. Calling you my man of business seemed to give that
      old pilferer a few ideas. Did they see you come in, those porters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, as I went by,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;that the woman was asleep in
      her chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well she might be,&rdquo; said the Cardinal, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, really?&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; replied the fishwife; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s enough for one is enough for two;
      the rest of the stuff went that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the husband, he was there,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;for he gave me a
      gracious sign of recognition, which I could have done without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till it is quite dark, and we&rsquo;ll play him a comedy that shall fool
      him finely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, ten minutes later, the fishwife, with a vim that delighted
      the usurer, organized for the innocent porter the comedy of a <i>monsieur</i>
      who would not, out of politeness, let her accompany him to the door; she
      herself with equal politeness insisting. Appearing to conduct the sham
      physician into the street gate she pretended that the wind had blown out
      of her lamp, and under pretext of relighting it she put out that of
      Perrache. All this racket, accompanied by exclamations and a bewildering
      loquacity, was so briskly carried out that the porter, if summoned before
      the police-court, would not have hesitated to swear that the doctor, whose
      arrival he had witnessed, left the house between nine and ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two accomplices were thus in tranquil possession of the field of
      operations Madame Cardinal hung up her rabbit&rsquo;s-hair shawl before the
      window to exclude all possible indiscretion on the part of a neighbor. In
      the Luxembourg quarter life quiets down early. By ten o&rsquo;clock all the
      sounds in the house as well as those out of doors were stilled, and
      Cerizet declared that the moment had come to go to work; by beginning at
      once they were certain that the sleeper would remain under the influence
      of the drug; besides, if the booty were found at once, Madame Cardinal
      could, under pretence of a sudden attack on her patient, which required
      her to fetch a remedy from the apothecary, get the porter to open the
      street gate for her without suspicion. As all porters pull the gate-cord
      from their beds, Cerizet would be able to get away at the same time
      without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powerful in advice, Cerizet was a very incapable hand in action; and,
      without the robust assistance of Mere Cardinal he could never have lifted
      what might almost be called the corpse of the former drum-major.
      Completely insensible, Toupillier was now an inert mass, a dead-weight,
      which could, fortunately, be handled without much precaution, and the
      athletic Madame Cardinal, gathering strength from her cupidity, contrived,
      notwithstanding Cerizet&rsquo;s insufficient assistance, to effect the transfer
      of her uncle from one bed to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      On rummaging the bed from which the body was moved, nothing was found, and
      Madame Cardinal, pressed by Cerizet to explain why she had confidently
      asserted that her uncle &ldquo;was lying on one hundred thousand francs in
      gold,&rdquo; was forced to admit that a talk with Madame Perrache, and her own
      fervid imagination were the sole grounds of her certainty. Cerizet was
      furious; having for one whole day dallied with the idea and hope of
      fortune, having, moreover, entered upon a dangerous and compromising
      course of action, only to find himself, at the supreme moment, face to
      face with&mdash;nothing! The disappointment was so bitter that if he had
      not been afraid of the muscular strength of his future mother-in-law, he
      would have rushed upon her with some frantic intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger, however, spent itself in words. Harshly abused, Madame Cardinal
      contented herself by remarking that all hope was not lost, and then, with
      a faith that ought to have moved mountains, she set to work to empty the
      straw from the mattress she had already vainly explored in all directions.
      But Cerizet would not allow that extreme measure; he remarked that after
      the autopsy of a straw mattress such detritus would remain upon the floor
      as must infallibly give rise to suspicion. But the Cardinal, who thought
      this caution ridiculous, was determined to, at least, take apart the flock
      bedstead. The passion of the search gave extraordinary vigilance to her
      senses, and as she raised the wooden side-frame she heard the fall of some
      tiny object on the floor. Seizing the light she began to search in the
      mound of filth of all kinds that was under the bed, and finally laid her
      hand on a bit of polished steel about half an inch long, the use of which
      was to her inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a key!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, who was standing beside her with some
      indifference, but whose imagination now set off at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! you see I was right,&rdquo; cried the Cardinal. &ldquo;But what can it open?&rdquo;
       she added, on reflection; &ldquo;nothing bigger than a doll&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;it is a modern invention, and very strong locks can
      be opened with that little instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a rapid glance he took in all the pieces of furniture in the room;
      went to the bureau and pulled out the drawers; looked in the stove, in the
      table; but nowhere did he find a lock to which the little key could be
      adapted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Cardinal had a flash of illumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I remarked that the old thief, as he lay on his
      bed, never took his eyes off the wall just opposite to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cupboard hidden in the wall!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, seizing the light eagerly;
      &ldquo;it is not impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Examining attentively the door of the alcove, which was opposite the bed&rsquo;s
      head, he could see nothing there but a vast accumulation of dust and
      spiders&rsquo; webs. He next employed the sense of touch, and began to rap and
      sound the wall in all directions. At the spot to which Toupillier&rsquo;s
      constant gaze was directed he thought he perceived in a very narrow space
      a slight sonority, and he presently perceived that he was rapping on wood.
      He then rubbed the spot vigorously with his handkerchief, and beneath the
      thick layer of dust and dirt which he thus removed he found a piece of oak
      plank carefully inserted in the wall. On one side of this plank was a
      small round hole; it was that of the lock which the key fitted!
    </p>
    <p>
      While Cerizet was turning the key, which worked with great difficulty,
      Madame Cardinal, holding the light, was pale and breathless; but, oh!
      cruel deception! the cupboard, at last unlocked and open, showed only an
      empty space, into which the light in her hand fell uselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allowing this bacchante to give vent to her despair by saluting her
      much-beloved uncle with the harshest epithets, Cerizet quietly inserted
      his arm into the cupboard, and after feeling it over at the back, he cried
      out, &ldquo;An iron safe!&rdquo; adding, impatiently, &ldquo;Give me more light, Madame
      Cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the light did not penetrate to the depths of the cupboard, he
      snatched the candle from the bottle, where, in default of a candlestick,
      the Cardinal had stuck it, and, taking it in his hand, moved it carefully
      over all parts of the iron safe, the existence of which was now a
      certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no visible lock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There must be a secret opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he sly, that old villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Cardinal, while
      Cerizet&rsquo;s bony fingers felt the side of the safe over minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after groping for ten minutes, &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this time Madame Cardinal&rsquo;s life seemed actually suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the pressure which Cerizet now applied, the iron side rose quickly
      into the thickness of the wall above, and in the midst of a mass of gold
      thrown pell-mell into a large excavation that was now exposed to view, lay
      a case of red morocco, which, from its size and appearance, gave promise
      of magnificent booty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take the diamonds for myself,&rdquo; said Cerizet, when he had opened the
      case and seen the splendid jewels it contained; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t know how to get
      rid of them. I&rsquo;ll leave you the gold for your share. As for the house and
      the money in the Funds, they are not worth the trouble it would be to get
      the old fellow to make a will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, my little man!&rdquo; replied the Cardinal, who thought this
      decision rather summary; &ldquo;we will first count the money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet, apparently listening to a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear some one moving below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hear nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet, making her a sign to be silent, listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear a step on the stairs,&rdquo; he said, a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hastily replaced the morocco case, and made desperate but
      unavailing efforts to lower the panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Madame Cardinal, terrified; &ldquo;some one is really coming.&rdquo;
       Then, fastening to a hope of safety, she added, &ldquo;I dare say it is that
      insane girl; they say she walks at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the insane girl (if it were she) had a key to the room, for a
      moment later, this key was inserted in the lock. With a rapid glance
      Madame Cardinal measured the distance to the door; should she have time to
      push the bolt? No; certain that it was then too late, so she blew out the
      candle to give herself at least some chances in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Useless effort! the intruder who now appeared had brought a candle with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Cerizet saw that she had to do with a small, old man of puny
      appearance, she flung herself before him with flaming eyes, like a lioness
      from whom the hunter is seeking to take her cubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm, my good woman,&rdquo; said the little man, in a jeering tone; &ldquo;the
      police are sent for; they will be here in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word &ldquo;police&rdquo; the Cardinal&rsquo;s legs gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why the police? we are not robbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that; if I were in your place I shouldn&rsquo;t wait for them,&rdquo;
       said the little old man; &ldquo;they make unfortunate mistakes sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I clear out?&rdquo; asked the woman, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you empty your pockets of anything which has, <i>by accident</i>,
      got into them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my good monsieur, I haven&rsquo;t a thing in my hands or my pockets; I
      wasn&rsquo;t here to harm any one,&mdash;only to nurse my poor dear uncle; you
      can search me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, be off with you! that will do,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Cardinal did not oblige him to repeat the order, and she rapidly
      disappeared down the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet made as though he would take the same road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monsieur, are quite another thing,&rdquo; said the little old man. &ldquo;You
      and I must talk together; but if you are tractable, the affair between us
      can be settled amicably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was that the narcotic had ceased to operate, or that the noise
      going on about Toupillier put an end to his sleep, he now opened his eyes
      and cast around him the glance of a man who endeavors to remember where he
      is; then, seeing his precious cupboard open, he found in the emotion that
      sight produced the strength to cry out two or three times, &ldquo;Help! help!
      robbers!&rdquo; in a voice that was loud enough to rouse the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Toupillier,&rdquo; said the little old man; &ldquo;you have not been robbed; I
      came here in time to prevent it; nothing has been taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you arrest that villain?&rdquo; shouted the old pauper, pointing to
      Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is not a thief,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;On the contrary, he came
      up with me to lend assistance.&rdquo; Then, turning to Cerizet, he added, in a
      low voice: &ldquo;I think, my good friend, that we had better postpone the
      interview I desire to have with you until to-morrow. Come at ten o&rsquo;clock
      to the adjoining house, and ask for Monsieur du Portail. After what has
      passed this evening, there will, I ought to warn you, be some danger to
      you in not accepting this conference. I shall find you elsewhere,
      infallibly; for I have the honor to know who you are; you are the man whom
      the Opposition journals were accustomed to call &lsquo;the courageous Cerizet.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the profound sarcasm of this remark, Cerizet, perceiving that
      he was not to be treated more rigorously than Madame Cardinal, felt so
      pleased with this conclusion that he promised, very readily, to keep the
      appointment, and then slipped away with all the haste he could.

      CHAPTER XVI. DU PORTAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Cerizet did not fail to appear at the rendezvous given to
      him. Examined, at first, through the wicket of the door, he was admitted,
      after giving his name, into the house, and was ushered immediately to the
      study of Monsieur du Portail, whom he found at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without rising, and merely making a sign to his guest to take a chair, the
      little old man continued the letter he was then writing. After sealing it
      with wax, with a care and precision that denoted a nature extremely
      fastidious and particular, or else a man accustomed to discharge
      diplomatic functions, du Portail rang for Bruneau, his valet, and said, as
      he gave him the letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the justice-of-peace of the arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he carefully wiped the steel pen he had just used, restored to their
      places, symmetrically, all the displaced articles on his desk, and it was
      only when these little arrangements were completed that he turned to
      Cerizet, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that we lost that poor Monsieur Toupillier last
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really?&rdquo; said Cerizet, putting on the most sympathetic air he could
      manage. &ldquo;This is my first knowledge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you probably expected it. When one gives a dying man an immense bowl
      of hot wine, which has also been narcotized,&mdash;for the Perrache woman
      slept all night in a sort of lethargy after drinking a small glass of it,&mdash;it
      is evident that the catastrophe has been hastened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ignorant, monsieur,&rdquo; said Cerizet, with dignity, &ldquo;of what Madame
      Cardinal may have given to her uncle. I have no doubt committed a great
      piece of thoughtlessness in assisting this woman to obtain an inheritance
      to which she assured me she had legal rights; but as to attempting the
      life of that old pauper, I am quite incapable of such a thing; nothing of
      the kind ever entered my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote me this letter, I think,&rdquo; said du Portail, abruptly, taking
      from beneath a bohemian glass bowl a paper which he offered to Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter?&rdquo; replied Cerizet, with the hesitation of a man who doesn&rsquo;t know
      whether to lie or speak the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure of what I say,&rdquo; continued du Portail. &ldquo;I have a mania for
      autographs, and I possess one of yours, obtained at the period when the
      Opposition exalted you to the glorious rank of martyr. I have compared the
      two writings, and I find that you certainly wrote me, yesterday, the
      letter which you hold in your hand, informing me of the money
      embarrassments of young la Peyrade at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;knowing that you had given a home to Mademoiselle
      de la Peyrade, who is probably cousin of Theodose, I thought I recognized
      in you the mysterious protector from whom, on more than one occasion, my
      friend has received the most generous assistance. Now, as I have a sincere
      affection for that poor fellow, it was in his interests that I permitted
      myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did quite right,&rdquo; interrupted du Portail. &ldquo;I am delighted to have
      fallen in with a friend of la Peyrade. I ought not to conceal from you
      that it was this particular fact which protected you last night. But tell
      me, what is this about notes for twenty-five thousand francs? Is our
      friend so badly off in his affairs? Is he leading a dissipated life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a puritan. Given to the deepest
      piety, he did not choose to take, as a barrister, any other cases but
      those of the poor. He is now on the point of making a rich marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is he going to be married? and to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a Demoiselle Colleville, daughter of the secretary of the mayor of the
      12th arrondissement. In herself, the girl has no fortune, but a certain
      Monsieur Thuillier, her godfather, member of the Council-general of the
      Seine, has promised her a suitable &lsquo;dot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has handled this affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Peyrade has been devoted to the Thuillier family, into which he was
      introduced by Monsieur Dutocq, clerk of the justice-of-peace of their
      arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wrote me that these notes were signed in favor of Monsieur
      Dutocq. The affair is a bit of matrimonial brokerage, in short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something of that kind,&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;You know, monsieur, that
      in Paris such transactions are very common. Even the clergy won&rsquo;t disdain
      to have a finger in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the marriage a settled thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and within the last few days especially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good sir, I rely on you to put an end to it. I have other views
      for Theodose,&mdash;another marriage to propose to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;to break up this marriage would make it
      impossible for him to pay his notes; and I have the honor to call your
      attention to the fact that these particular bills of exchange are serious
      matters. Monsieur Dutocq is in the office of the justice-of-peace; in
      other words, he couldn&rsquo;t be easily defeated in such a matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The debt to Monsieur Dutocq you shall buy off yourself,&rdquo; replied du
      Portail. &ldquo;Make arrangements with him to that effect. Should Theodose prove
      reluctant to carry out my plans, those notes may become a useful weapon in
      our hands. You will take upon yourself to sue him for them, and you shall
      have no money responsibility in the matter. I will pay you the amount of
      the notes for Dutocq, and your costs in suing Theodose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are square in business, monsieur,&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some
      pleasure in being your agent. Now, if you think the right moment has come,
      I should be glad if you would give me some better light on the mission you
      are doing me the honor to place in my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke just now,&rdquo; replied du Portail, &ldquo;of the cousin of Theodose,
      Mademoiselle Lydie de la Peyrade. This young woman, who is not in her
      first youth, for she is nearly thirty, is the natural daughter of the
      celebrated Mademoiselle Beaumesnil of the Theatre Francais and Peyrade,
      the commissary-general of police under the Empire, and the uncle of our
      friend. Until his death, which occurred suddenly, leaving his daughter,
      whom he loved tenderly, without means of support, I was bound to that
      excellent man with the warmest friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad to show that he had some knowledge of du Portail&rsquo;s interior life,
      Cerizet hastened to remark:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have secretly fulfilled the duties of that friendship, monsieur;
      for, in taking into your home that interesting orphan you assumed a
      difficult guardianship. Mademoiselle de la Peyrade&rsquo;s state of health
      requires, I am told, a care not only affectionate, but persevering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied du Portail, &ldquo;the poor girl, after the death of her father,
      was so cruelly tried that her mind has been somewhat affected; but a
      fortunate change has lately occurred in her condition, and only yesterday
      I called in consultation Doctor Bianchon and the two physicians-in-charge
      of Bicetre and the Salpetriere. These gentlemen unanimously declare that
      marriage and the birth of a first child would undoubtedly restore her to
      perfect health. You can readily understand that the remedy is too easy and
      agreeable not to be attempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;it is to Mademoiselle Lydie de la Peyrade, his
      cousin, that you wish to marry Theodose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it,&rdquo; returned du Portail, &ldquo;and you must not think that our
      young friend, if he accepts the marriage, will be called upon to show a
      gratuitous devotion. Lydie is very agreeable in person; she has talents, a
      charming disposition, and she can bring to bear, in her husband&rsquo;s
      interest, a strong influence in public life. She has, moreover, a pretty
      fortune, consisting of what her mother left her, and of my entire
      property, which, having no heirs myself, I intend to secure to her in the
      marriage contract. Besides all this, she has this very night acquired a
      not inconsiderable legacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet, &ldquo;do you mean that old Toupillier&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a will in his own handwriting, which I have here, that old pauper
      constitutes her his sole legatee. You see, therefore, that I showed some
      kindness in not proceeding against you and Madame Cardinal for your little
      attempt last night; it was simply our property that you were trying to
      pillage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pretend to excuse Madame Cardinal&rsquo;s
      misconduct; and yet, as one of the legal heirs, dispossessed by a
      stranger, she had, it seems to me, some right to the indulgence which you
      certainly showed to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that you are mistaken,&rdquo; said du Portail; &ldquo;the apparent liberality of
      the old beggar to Mademoiselle de la Peyrade happens to be only a
      restitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A restitution!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet, in a tone of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A restitution,&rdquo; repeated du Portail, &ldquo;and nothing is easier than to prove
      it. Do you remember the robbery of some diamonds from one of our dramatic
      celebrities about ten years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;I was manager of one of my newspapers at the
      time, and I used to write the &lsquo;Paris items.&rsquo; But stay, I remember, the
      actress who lost them was Mademoiselle Beaumesnil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; the mother of Mademoiselle de la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently, this miserable old Toupillier&mdash;no, I remember that the
      thief was convicted; his name was Charles Crochard. It was said, under the
      rose, that he was the natural son of a great personage, the Comte de
      Granville, attorney-general under the Restoration.&rdquo; [See &ldquo;A Double Life.&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;this is how it happened. The robbery was
      committed in a house in the rue de Tournon, occupied by Mademoiselle
      Beaumesnil. Charles Crochard, who was a handsome fellow, was said to have
      the run of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried Cerizet, &ldquo;I remember Mademoiselle Beaumesnil&rsquo;s
      embarrassment when she gave her testimony&mdash;and also the total
      extinction of voice that attacked her when the judge asked her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The robbery,&rdquo; continued du Portail, &ldquo;was audaciously committed in the
      daytime; and no sooner did Charles Crochard get possession of the casket
      than he went to the church of Saint-Sulpice, where he had an appointment
      with an accomplice, who, being supplied with a passport, was to start
      immediately with the diamonds for foreign parts. It so chanced that on
      entering the church, instead of meeting the man he expected, who was a
      trifle late, Charles Crochard came face to face with a celebrated agent of
      the detective force, who was well known to him, inasmuch as the young
      rascal was not at his first scrimmage with the police. The absence of his
      accomplice, this encounter with the detective, and, lastly, a rapid
      movement made by the latter, by the merest chance, toward the door,
      induced the robber to fancy he was being watched. Losing his head under
      this idea, he wanted, at any cost, to put the casket out of his
      possession, knowing that if arrested, as he expected, at the door of the
      church, it would be a damning proof against him. Catching sight at that
      moment of Toupillier, who was then the giver of holy water, &lsquo;My man,&rsquo; said
      he, making sure that no one overheard their colloquy, &lsquo;will you take care
      of this little package for me? It is a box of lace. I am going near by to
      a countess who is slow to pay her bill; and if I have the lace with me
      she&rsquo;ll want to see it, for it is a new style, and she&rsquo;ll ask me to leave
      it with her on credit, instead of paying the bill; therefore I don&rsquo;t want
      to take it. But,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;be sure not to touch the paper that wraps the
      box, for there&rsquo;s nothing harder than to do up a package in the same folds&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The booby!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, naively; &ldquo;why, that very caution would make
      the man want to open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an able casuist,&rdquo; said du Portail. &ldquo;Well, an hour later, Charles
      Crochard, finding that nothing happened to him, returned to the church to
      obtain his deposit, but Toupillier was no longer there. You can imagine
      the anxiety with which Charles Crochard attended early mass the next day,
      and approached the giver of holy water, who was there, sure enough,
      attending to his functions. But night, they say, brings counsel; the
      worthy beggar audaciously declared that he had received no package, and
      did not know what his interlocutor meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was no possibility of arguing with him, for that would be
      exposure,&rdquo; remarked Cerizet, who was not far from sympathizing in a trick
      so boldly played.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; resumed du Portail; &ldquo;the robbery was already noised about, and
      Toupillier, who was a very able fellow, had calculated that Charles
      Crochard would not dare to publicly accuse him, for that would reveal the
      theft. In fact, on his trial Charles Crochard never said a word of his
      mishap, and during the six years he spent at the galleys (he was condemned
      to ten, but four were remitted) he did not open his lips to a single soul
      about the treachery of which he had been a victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was pretty plucky,&rdquo; said Cerizet; the tale excited him, and he
      showed openly that he saw the matter as an artist and a connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that interval,&rdquo; continued du Portail, &ldquo;Madame Beaumesnil died, leaving
      her daughter a few fragments of a once great fortune, and the diamonds
      which the will expressly stated Lydie was to receive &lsquo;in case they were
      recovered.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet, &ldquo;bad for Toupillier, because, having to do
      with a man of your calibre&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles Crochard&rsquo;s first object on being liberated was vengeance on
      Toupillier, and his first step was to denounce him to the police as
      receiver of the stolen property. Taken in hand by the law, Toupillier
      defended himself with such singular good-humor, being able to show that no
      proof whatever existed against him, that the examining judge let him off.
      He lost his place, however, as giver of holy water, obtaining, with great
      difficulty, permission to beg at the door of the church. For my part, I
      was certain of his guilt; and I managed to have the closest watch kept
      upon him; though I relied far more upon myself. Being a man of means and
      leisure, I stuck, as you may say, to the skin of my thief, and did, in
      order to unmask him, one of the cleverest things of my career. He was
      living at that time in the rue du Coeur-Volant. I succeeded in becoming
      the tenant of the room adjoining his; and one night, through a gimlet hole
      I had drilled in the partition, I saw my man take the case of diamonds
      from a very cleverly contrived hiding-place. He sat for an hour gazing at
      them and fondling them; he made them sparkle in the light, he pressed them
      passionately to his lips. The man actually loved those diamonds for
      themselves, and had never thought of turning them to money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Cerizet,&mdash;&ldquo;a mania like that of Cardillac, the
      jeweller, which has now been dramatized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just it,&rdquo; returned du Portail; &ldquo;the poor wretch was in love with
      that casket; so that when, shortly after, I entered his room and told him
      I knew all, he proposed to me to leave him the life use of what he called
      the consolation of his old age, pledging himself to make Mademoiselle de
      la Peyrade his sole heir, revealing to me at the same time the existence
      of a hoard of gold (to which he was adding every day), and also the
      possession of a house and an investment in the Funds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he made that proposal in good faith,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;it was a
      desirable one. The interest of the capital sunk in the diamonds was more
      than returned by that from the other property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You now see, my dear sir,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;that I was not mistaken in
      trusting him. All my precautions were well taken; I exacted that he should
      occupy a room in the house I lived in, where I could keep a close eye upon
      him. I assisted him in making that hiding-place, the secret of which you
      discovered so cleverly; but what you did not find out was that in touching
      the spring that opened the iron safe you rang a bell in my apartment,
      which warned me of any attempt that was made to remove our treasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Madame Cardinal!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, good-humoredly, &ldquo;how far she was
      from suspecting it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s the situation,&rdquo; resumed du Portail. &ldquo;On account of the
      interest I feel in the nephew of my old friend, and also, on account of
      the relationship, this marriage seems to me extremely desirable; in short,
      I unite Theodose to his cousin and her &lsquo;dot.&rsquo; As it is possible that,
      considering the mental state of his future wife, Theodose may object to
      sharing my views, I have not thought it wise to make this proposal
      directly to himself. You have suddenly turned up upon my path; I know
      already that you are clever and wily, and that knowledge induces me to put
      this little matrimonial negotiation into your hands. Now, I think, you
      understand the matter thoroughly; speak to him of a fine girl, with one
      little drawback, but, on the other hand, a comfortable fortune. Do not
      name her to him; and come here and let me know how the proposal has been
      taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your confidence delights me as much as it honors me,&rdquo; replied Cerizet,
      &ldquo;and I will justify it the best I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not expect too much,&rdquo; said du Portail. &ldquo;Refusal will be the first
      impulse of a man who has an affair on hand elsewhere; but we need not
      consider ourselves beaten. I shall not easily give up a plan which I know
      to be just, even if I push my zeal so far as to put la Peyrade under lock
      and key in Clichy. I am resolved not to take no for his answer to a
      proposal of which, in the end, he cannot fail to see the propriety.
      Therefore, in any case, buy up those notes from Monsieur Dutocq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At par?&rdquo; asked Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at par, if you cannot do better; we are not going to haggle over a
      few thousand francs; only, when this transaction is arranged, Monsieur
      Dutocq must pledge us either his assistance, or, at the very least, his
      neutrality. After what you have said of the other marriage, it is
      unnecessary for me to warn you that there is not a moment to lose in
      putting our irons into the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days hence I have an appointment with la Peyrade,&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;We
      have a little matter of business of our own to settle. Don&rsquo;t you think it
      would be best to wait till then, when I can introduce the proposal
      incidentally? In case of resistance, I think that arrangement would best
      conduce to OUR dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said du Portail; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t much of a delay. Remember,
      monsieur, that if you succeed you have, in place of a man able to bring
      you to a stern account for your <i>imprudent assistance</i> to Madame
      Cardinal, a greatly obliged person, who will be ready at all times to
      serve you, and whose influence is greater than is generally supposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After these friendly words, the pair separated with a thoroughly good
      understanding, and well satisfied with each other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH THE LAMB DEVOURS THE WOLF
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening before the day already agreed upon, Theodose received from
      Cerizet the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, lease or no lease, Rocher de Cancale, half-past six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Dutocq, Cerizet saw him every day, for he was still his copying
      clerk; he therefore gave him his invitation by word of mouth; but the
      attentive reader must remark a difference in the hour named:
      &ldquo;Quarter-past-six, Rocher de Cancale,&rdquo; said Cerizet. It was evident,
      therefore, that he wanted that fifteen minutes with Dutocq before the
      arrival of la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      These minutes the usurer proposed to employ in jockeying Dutocq in the
      purchase of the notes; he fancied that if the proposition to buy them were
      suddenly put before him without the slightest preparation it might be more
      readily received. By not leaving the seller time to bethink himself,
      perhaps he might lead him to loosen his grasp, and the notes once bought
      below par, he could consider at his leisure whether to pocket the
      difference or curry favor with du Portail for the discount he had
      obtained. Let us say, moreover, that apart from self-interest, Cerizet
      would still have endeavored to scrape a little profit out of his friend;
      &lsquo;twas an instinct and a need of his nature. He had as great a horror for
      straight courses as the lovers of English gardens show in the lines of
      their paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dutocq, having still a portion of the cost of his practice to pay off, was
      forced to live very sparingly, so that a dinner at the Rocher de Cancale
      was something of an event in the economy of his straitened existence. He
      arrived, therefore, with that punctuality which testifies to an interest
      in the occasion, and precisely at a quarter past six he entered the
      private room of the restaurant where Cerizet awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is queer,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;here we are returned to precisely the situation
      in which we began our business relationship with la Peyrade,&mdash;except,
      to be sure, that this present place of meeting of the three emperors is
      more comfortable; I prefer the Tilsit of the rue Montgorgeuil to the
      Tilsit of the Cheval Rouge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith!&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that the results justify the change,
      for, to be frank, where are the profits to <i>us</i> in the scheme of our
      triumvirate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;it was a bargain with a long time limit. It can&rsquo;t be
      said that la Peyrade has lost much time in getting installed&mdash;forgive
      the pun&mdash;at the Thuilleries. The scamp has made his way pretty fast,
      you must own that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast but what his marriage,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;is at the present
      moment a very doubtful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtful!&rdquo; cried Dutocq; &ldquo;why doubtful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am commissioned to propose to him another wife, and I&rsquo;m not sure
      that any choice is left to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you about, my dear fellow, lending your hand in this
      way to another marriage when you know we have a mortgage on the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One isn&rsquo;t always master of circumstances, my friend; I saw at once when
      the new affair was laid before me that the one we had settled on must
      infallibly go by the board. Consequently, I&rsquo;ve tried to work it round in
      our interests, yours and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! do you mean they are pulling caps for this Theodose? Who is the
      new match? Has she money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;dot&rsquo; is pretty good; quite as much as Mademoiselle Colleville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wouldn&rsquo;t give a fig for it. La Peyrade has signed those notes and
      he will pay them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he pay them? that&rsquo;s the question. You are not a business man,
      neither is Theodose; it may come into his head to dispute the validity of
      those notes. What security have we that if the facts about their origin
      should come out, and the Thuillier marriage shouldn&rsquo;t come off, the court
      of commerce mightn&rsquo;t annul them as &lsquo;obligations without cause.&rsquo; For my
      part, I should laugh at such a decision; I can stand it; and, moreover, my
      precautions are taken; but you, as clerk to a justice-of-peace, don&rsquo;t you
      see that such an affair would give the chancellor a bone to pick with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Dutocq, with the ill-humor of a man who sees
      himself face to face with an argument he can&rsquo;t refute, &ldquo;you seem to have a
      mania for stirring up matters and meddling with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you again,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;this came to me; I didn&rsquo;t seek it; but
      I saw at once that there was no use struggling against the influence that
      is opposing us; so I chose the course of saving ourselves by a sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sacrifice! what sort of sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! I&rsquo;ve sold my share of those notes, leaving those who bought them
      to fight it out with Master barrister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the purchaser?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you suppose would step into my shoes unless it were the persons
      who have an interest in this other marriage, and who want to hold a power
      over Theodose, and control him by force if necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my share of the notes is equally important to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; but I couldn&rsquo;t speak for you until I had consulted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! my dear fellow, the same that I accepted. Knowing better than
      you the danger of their competition I sold out to them on very bad terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what are they, those terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave up my shares for fifteen thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Dutocq, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;what you are after is
      to recover a loss (if you made it) by a commission on my share&mdash;and
      perhaps, after all, the whole thing is only a plot between you and la
      Peyrade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, my good friend, you don&rsquo;t mince your words; an infamous
      thought comes into your head and you state it with charming frankness.
      Luckily you shall presently hear me make the proposal to Theodose, and you
      are clever enough to know by his manner if there has been any connivance
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; said Dutocq. &ldquo;I withdraw the insinuation; but I must say your
      employers are pirates; I call their proposal throttling people. I have
      not, like you, something to fall back upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you poor fellow, this is how I reasoned: I said to myself, That
      good Dutocq is terribly pressed for the last payment on his practice; this
      will give him enough to pay it off at one stroke; events have proved that
      there are great uncertainties about our Theodose-and-Thuillier scheme;
      here&rsquo;s money down, live money, and therefore it won&rsquo;t be so bad a bargain
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a loss of two-fifths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;you were talking just now of commissions. I see a
      means of getting one for you if you&rsquo;ll engage to batter down this
      Colleville marriage. If you will cry it down as you have lately cried it
      up I shouldn&rsquo;t despair of getting you a round twenty thousand out of the
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think that this new proposal will not be agreeable to la
      Peyrade,&mdash;that he&rsquo;ll reject it? Is it some heiress on whom he has
      already taken a mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I can tell you is that these people expect some difficulty in
      bringing the matter to a conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t desire better than to follow your lead and do what is
      disagreeable to la Peyrade; but five thousand francs&mdash;think of it!&mdash;it
      is too much to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened, and a waiter ushered in the expected
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can serve dinner,&rdquo; said Cerizet to the waiter; &ldquo;we are all here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that Theodose was beginning to take wing toward higher social
      spheres; elegance was becoming a constant thought in his mind. He appeared
      in a dress suit and varnished shoes, whereas his two associates received
      him in frock-coats and muddy boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I am a little late, but that devil of a
      Thuillier is the most intolerable of human beings about a pamphlet I am
      concocting for him. I was unlucky enough to agree to correct the proofs
      with him, and over every paragraph there&rsquo;s a fight. &lsquo;What I can&rsquo;t
      understand,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the public can&rsquo;t, either. I&rsquo;m not a man of letters,
      but I&rsquo;m a practical man&rsquo;; and that&rsquo;s the way we battle it, page after
      page. I thought the sitting this afternoon would never end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unreasonable you are, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Dutocq; &ldquo;when a man wants
      to succeed he must have the courage to make sacrifices. Once married, you
      can lift your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said la Peyrade with a sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lift it; for since the day
      you made me eat this bread of anguish I&rsquo;ve become terribly sick of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;has a plan that will feed you more succulently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said at the moment, for justice had to be done to the
      excellent fare ordered by Cerizet in honor of his coming lease. As usually
      happens at dinners where affairs are likely to be discussed, each man,
      with his mind full of them, took pains not to approach those topics,
      fearing to compromise his advantages by seeming eager; the conversation,
      therefore, continued for a long time on general subjects, and it was not
      until the dessert was served that Cerizet brought himself to ask la
      Peyrade what had been settled about the terms of his lease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my friend,&rdquo; replied Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! nothing? I certainly allowed you time enough to decide the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as to that, something is decided. There will not be any principal
      tenant at all; Mademoiselle Brigitte is going to let the house herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a singular thing,&rdquo; said Cerizet, stiffly. &ldquo;After your agreement
      with me, I certainly did not expect such a result as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it, my dear fellow? I agreed with you, barring amendments
      on the other side; I wasn&rsquo;t able to give another turn to the affair. In
      her natural character as a managing woman and a sample of perpetual
      motion, Brigitte has reflected that she might as well manage that house
      herself and put into her own pocket the profits you proposed to make. I
      said all I could about the cares and annoyances which she would certainly
      saddle upon herself. &lsquo;Oh! nonsense!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll stir my blood and
      do my health good!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pitiable!&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;That poor old maid will never know which
      end to take hold of; she doesn&rsquo;t imagine what it is to have an empty
      house, and which must be filled with tenants from garret to cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I plied her with all those arguments,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;but I
      couldn&rsquo;t move her resolution. Don&rsquo;t you see, my dear democrats, you
      stirred up the revolution of &lsquo;89; you thought to make a fine speculation
      in dethroning the noble by the bourgeois, and the end of it is you are
      shoved out yourselves. This looks like paradox; but you&rsquo;ve found out now
      that the peasant and clodhopper isn&rsquo;t malleable; he can&rsquo;t be forced down
      and kept under like the noble. The aristocracy, on behalf of its dignity,
      would not condescend to common cares, and was therefore dependent on a
      crowd of plebeian servitors to whom it had to trust for three-fourths of
      the actions of its own life. That was the reign of stewards and bailiffs,
      wily fellows, into whose hands the interests of the great families passed,
      and who fed and grew fat on the parings of the great fortunes they
      managed. But now-a-days, utilitarian theories, as they call them, have
      come to the fore,&mdash;&lsquo;We are never so well served as by ourselves,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no shame in attending to one&rsquo;s own business,&rsquo; and many other
      bourgeois maxims which have suppressed the role of intermediaries. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t Mademoiselle Brigitte Thuillier manage her own house when dukes
      and peers go in person to the Bourse, where such men sign their own leases
      and read the deeds before they sign them, and go themselves to the notary,
      whom, in former days, they considered a servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this time Cerizet had time to recover from the blow he had just
      received squarely in the face, and to think of the transition he had to
      make from one set of interests to the other, of which he was now the
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are declaiming there is all very clever,&rdquo; he said, carelessly,
      &ldquo;but the thing that proves to me our defeat is the fact that you are not
      on the terms with Mademoiselle Thuillier you would have us believe you
      are. She is slipping through your fingers; and I don&rsquo;t think that marriage
      is anything like as certain as Dutocq and I have been fancying it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no doubt,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;there are still some touches to be
      given to our sketch, but I believe it is well under way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think, on the contrary, that you have lost ground; and the reason
      is simple: you have done those people an immense service; and that&rsquo;s a
      thing never forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;I have more than one hold upon
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are mistaken. You thought you did a brilliant thing in putting
      them on a pinnacle, but the fact is you emancipated them; they&rsquo;ll keep you
      now at heel. The human heart, particularly the bourgeois heart, is made
      that way. If I were in your place I shouldn&rsquo;t feel so sure of being on
      solid ground, and if something else turned up that offered me a good
      chance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! just because I couldn&rsquo;t get you the lease of that house do you want
      to knock everything to pieces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I am not looking at the matter in the light of my own
      interests; I don&rsquo;t doubt that as a trustworthy friend you have done every
      imaginable thing to promote them; but I think the manner in which you have
      been shoved aside a very disturbing symptom. It even decides me to tell
      you something I did not intend to speak of; because, in my opinion, when
      persons start a course they ought to keep on steadily, looking neither
      forward nor back, and not allowing themselves to be diverted to other
      aspirations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, &ldquo;what does all this verbiage mean? Have you
      anything to propose to me? What&rsquo;s the price of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Theodose,&rdquo; said Cerizet, paying no attention to the impertinence,
      &ldquo;you yourself can judge of the value of discovering a young girl, well
      brought-up, adorned with beauty and talents and a &lsquo;dot&rsquo; equal to that of
      Celeste, which she has in her own right, <i>plus</i> fifty thousand
      francs&rsquo; worth of diamonds (as Mademoiselle Georges says on her posters in
      the provinces), and, moreover,&mdash;a fact which ought to strike the mind
      of an ambitious man,&mdash;a strong political influence, which she can use
      for a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this treasure you hold in your hand?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, in a tone of
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better still, I am authorized to offer it to you; in fact, I might say
      that I am charged to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, you are poking fun at me; unless, indeed, this phoenix has
      some hideous or prohibitory defect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;that there is a slight objection, not
      on the score of family, for, to tell the truth, the young woman has none&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;a natural child&mdash;Well, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, she is not so very young,&mdash;something like twenty-nine or so;
      but there&rsquo;s nothing easier than to turn an elderly girl into a young widow
      if you have imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all the venom in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all that is irreparable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that? Is it a case of rhinoplasty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Addressed to Cerizet the word had an aggressive air, which, in fact, was
      noticeable since the beginning of the dinner in the whole manner and
      conversation of the barrister. But it did not suit the purpose of the
      negotiator to resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;our nose is as well made as our foot and our waist; but
      we may, perhaps, have a slight touch of hysteria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very good,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;and as from hysteria to insanity there
      is but a step&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Cerizet, hastily, &ldquo;sorrows have affected our
      brain slightly; but the doctors are unanimous in their diagnosis; they all
      say that after the birth of the first child not a trace will remain of
      this little trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to admit that doctors are infallible,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade;
      &ldquo;but, in spite of your discouragement, you must allow me, my friend, to
      persist in my suit to Mademoiselle Colleville. Perhaps it is ridiculous to
      confess it, but the truth is I am gradually falling in love with that
      little girl. It isn&rsquo;t that her beauty is resplendent, or that the glitter
      of her &lsquo;dot&rsquo; has dazzled me, but I find in that child a great fund of
      sound sense joined to simplicity; and, what to mind is of greater
      consequence, her sincere and solid piety attracts me; I think a husband
      ought to be very happy with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cerizet, who, having been on the stage, may very well have
      known his Moliere, &ldquo;this marriage will crown your wishes with all good; it
      will be filled with sweetness and with pleasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The allusion to Tartuffe was keenly felt by la Peyrade, who took it up and
      said, hotly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The contact with innocence will disinfect me of the vile atmosphere in
      which I have lived too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will pay your notes of hand,&rdquo; added Cerizet, &ldquo;which I advise you
      to do with the least possible delay; for Dutocq here was saying to me just
      now that he would like to see the color of your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? not at all,&rdquo; interposed Dutocq. &ldquo;I think, on the contrary, that our
      friend has a right to the delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I agree with Cerizet. I hold that the less a
      debt is due, and therefore the more insecure and open to contention it is,
      the sooner one ought to free one&rsquo;s self by paying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear la Peyrade,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;why take this bitter tone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pulling from his pocket a portfolio, la Peyrade said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you those notes with you, Dutocq?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! no, my dear fellow,&rdquo; replied Dutocq, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t carry them about
      with me; besides, they are in Cerizet&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the barrister, rising, &ldquo;whenever you come to my house I&rsquo;ll
      pay you on the nail, as Cerizet can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you going to leave us without your coffee?&rdquo; said Cerizet,
      amazed to the last degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have an arbitration case at eight o&rsquo;clock. Besides, we have said
      all we had to say. You haven&rsquo;t your lease, but you&rsquo;ve got your twenty five
      thousand francs in full, and those of Dutocq are ready for him whenever he
      chooses to come to my office. I see nothing now to prevent me from going
      where my private business calls me, and I therefore very cordially bid you
      good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! Dutocq,&rdquo; cried Cerizet, as la Peyrade disappeared, &ldquo;this means a
      rupture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prepared with the utmost care,&rdquo; added Dutocq. &ldquo;Did you notice the air
      with which he pulled out that pocket-book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where the devil,&rdquo; said the usurer, &ldquo;could he have got the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; replied Dutocq, sarcastically, &ldquo;where he got that with which
      he paid you in full for those notes you sold at a sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Dutocq,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain to you the circumstances
      under which that insolent fellow freed himself, and you&rsquo;ll see if he
      didn&rsquo;t rob me of fifteen thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, but you, my worthy clerk, were trying to get ten thousand away
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I was positively ordered to buy up your claim; and you ought to
      remember that my offer had risen to twenty thousand when Theodose came
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;when we leave here we&rsquo;ll go to your house, where you
      will give me those notes; for, you&rsquo;ll understand that to-morrow morning,
      at the earliest decent hour, I shall go to la Peyrade&rsquo;s office; I don&rsquo;t
      mean to let his paying humor cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right you are; for I can tell you now that before long there&rsquo;ll be a
      fine upset in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the thing is really serious&mdash;this tale of a crazy woman you
      want him to marry? I must say that in his place, with these money-matters
      evidently on the rise, I should have backed out of your proposals just as
      he did. Ninas and Ophelias are all very well on the stage, but in a home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a home, when they bring a &lsquo;dot,&rsquo; we can be their guardian,&rdquo; replied
      Cerizet, sententiously. &ldquo;In point of fact, we get a fortune and not a
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one way to look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are willing,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;let us go and take our coffee
      somewhere else. This dinner has turned out so foolishly that I want to get
      out of this room, where there&rsquo;s no air.&rdquo; He rang for the waiter. &ldquo;Garcon!&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid! by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the gentleman who just went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is outrageous,&rdquo; cried Cerizet. &ldquo;I ordered the dinner, and you
      allow some one else to pay for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I, monsieur,&rdquo; said the waiter; &ldquo;the gentleman went and paid the
      &lsquo;dame du comptoir&rsquo;; she must have thought it was arranged between you.
      Besides, it is not so uncommon for gentlemen to have friendly disputes
      about paying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Cerizet, dismissing the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t these gentlemen take their coffee?&mdash;it is paid for,&rdquo; said the
      man before he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good reason for not taking it,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, angrily. &ldquo;It is really
      inconceivable that in a house of this kind such an egregious blunder
      should be committed. What do you think of such insolence?&rdquo; he added, when
      the waiter had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed Dutocq, taking his hat, &ldquo;it is a schoolboy proceeding; he
      wanted to show he had money; it is easy to see he never had any before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! that&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;he meant to mark the rupture. &lsquo;I
      will not owe you even a dinner,&rsquo; is what he says to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;this banquet was given to celebrate your
      enthronement as principal tenant of the grand house. Well, he has failed
      to get you the lease, and I can understand that his conscience was uneasy
      at letting you pay for a dinner which, like those notes of mine, were an
      &lsquo;obligation without cause.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet made no reply to this malicious observation. They had reached the
      counter where reigned the dame who had permitted the improper payment,
      and, for the sake of his dignity, the usurer thought it proper to make a
      fuss. After which the two men departed, and the copying-clerk took his
      employer to a low coffee-house in the Passage du Saumon. There Cerizet
      recovered his good-humor; he was like a fish out of water suddenly
      returned to his native element; for he had reached that state of
      degradation when he felt ill at ease in places frequented by good society;
      and it was with a sort of sensuous pleasure that he felt himself back in
      the vulgar place where they were noisily playing pool for the benefit of a
      &ldquo;former conqueror of the Bastille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this establishment Cerizet enjoyed the fame of being a skilful
      billiard-player, and he was now entreated to take part in a game already
      begun. In technical language, he &ldquo;bought his ball&rdquo;; that is, one of the
      players sold him his turn and his chances. Dutocq profited by this
      arrangement to slip away, on pretence of inquiring for a sick friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, in his shirt-sleeves, with a pipe between his lips, Cerizet
      made one of those masterly strokes which bring down the house with frantic
      applause. As he waited a moment, looking about him triumphantly, his eye
      lighted on a terrible kill-joy. Standing among the spectators with his
      chin on his cane, du Portail was steadily watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tinge of red showed itself in Cerizet&rsquo;s cheeks. He hesitated to bow or
      to recognize the old gentleman, a most unlikely person to meet in such a
      place. Not knowing how to take the unpleasant encounter, he went on
      playing; but his hand betrayed his uneasiness, and presently an unlucky
      stroke threw him out of the game. While he was putting on his coat in a
      tolerably ill-humor, du Portail passed, almost brushing him, on his way to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue Montmartre, at the farther end of the Passage,&rdquo; said the old man, in
      a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met, Cerizet had the bad taste to try to explain the
      disreputable position in which he had just been detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;in order to see you there, I had to be there
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned Cerizet. &ldquo;I was rather surprised to see a quiet
      inhabitant of the Saint-Sulpice quarter in such a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It merely proves to you,&rdquo; said the little old man, in a tone which cut
      short all explanation, and all curiosity, &ldquo;that I am in the habit of going
      pretty nearly everywhere, and that my star leads me into the path of those
      persons whom I wish to meet. I was thinking of you at the very moment you
      came in. Well, what have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good,&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;After playing me a devilish trick which
      deprived me of a magnificent bit of business, our man rejected your
      overture with scorn. There is no hope whatever in that claim of Dutocq&rsquo;s;
      for la Peyrade is chock-full of money; he wanted to pay the notes just
      now, and to-morrow morning he will certainly do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he regard his marriage to this Demoiselle Colleville as a settled
      thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He not only considers it settled, but he is trying now to make people
      believe it is a love-match. He rattled off a perfect tirade to convince me
      that he is really in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said du Portail, wishing, perhaps, to show that he could, on
      occasion, use the slang of a low billiard-room, &ldquo;&lsquo;stop the charge&rsquo;&rdquo;
       (meaning: Do nothing more); &ldquo;I will undertake to bring monsieur to reason.
      But come and see me to-morrow, and tell me all about the family he intends
      to enter. You have failed in this affair; but don&rsquo;t mind that; I shall
      have others for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he signed to the driver of an empty citadine, which was
      passing, got into it, and, with a nod to Cerizet, told the man to drive to
      the rue Honore-Chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cerizet walked down the rue Montmartre to regain the Estrapade quarter,
      he puzzled his brains to divine who that little old man with the curt
      speech, the imperious manner, and a tone that seemed to cast upon all
      those with whom he spoke a boarding-grapnel, could be; a man, too, who
      came from such a distance to spend his evening in a place where, judging
      by his clothes alone, he had no business to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had reached the Market without finding any solution to that
      problem, when he was roughly shaken out of it by a heavy blow in the back.
      Turning hastily, he found himself in presence of Madame Cardinal, an
      encounter with whom, at a spot where she came every morning to get fish to
      peddle, was certainly not surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that evening in Toupillier&rsquo;s garret, the worthy woman, in spite of
      the clemency so promptly shown to her, had judged it imprudent to make
      other than very short apparitions in her own domicile, and for the last
      two days she had been drowning among the liquor-dealers (called &ldquo;retailers
      of comfort&rdquo;) the pangs of her defeat. With flaming face and thickened
      voice she now addressed her late accomplice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what happened after I left you with that little
      old fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made him understand in a very few words,&rdquo; replied the banker of the
      poor, &ldquo;that it was all a mistake as to me. In this affair, my dear Madame
      Cardinal, you behaved with a really unpardonable heedlessness. How came
      you to ask my assistance in obtaining your inheritance from your uncle,
      when with proper inquiry you might have known there was a natural
      daughter, in whose favor he had long declared he should make a will? That
      little old man, who interrupted you in your foolish attempt to anticipate
      your legacy, was no other than the guardian of the daughter to whom
      everything is left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! guardian, indeed! a fine thing, guardian!&rdquo; cried the Cardinal. &ldquo;To
      talk of a woman of my age, just because I wanted to see if my uncle owned
      anything at all, to talk to <i>me</i> of the police! It&rsquo;s hateful! it&rsquo;s <i>disgusting</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t complain; you got off cheaply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you, who broke the locks and said you were going to take the
      diamonds, under color of marrying my daughter! Just as if she would have
      you,&mdash;a legitimate daughter like her! &lsquo;Never, mother,&rsquo; said she;
      &lsquo;never will I give my heart to a man with such a nose.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve found her, have you?&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until last night. She has left her blackguard of a player, and she is
      now, I flatter myself, in a fine position, eating money; has her citadine
      by the month, and is much respected by a barrister who would marry her at
      once, but he has got to wait till his parents die, for the father happens
      to be mayor, and the government wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mayor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;11th arrondissement,&mdash;Minard, powerfully rich, used to do a business
      in cocoa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! very good! very good! I know all about him. You say Olympe is living
      with his son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not to say living together, for that would make talk, though he
      only sees her with good motives. He lives at home with his father, but he
      has bought their furniture, and has put it, and my daughter, too, into a
      lodging in the Chausee d&rsquo;Antin; stylish quarter, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me pretty well arranged,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;and as Heaven, it
      appears, didn&rsquo;t destine us for each other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, yes, well, that&rsquo;s how it was; and I think that girl is going to give
      me great satisfaction; and there&rsquo;s something I want to consult you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my daughter being in luck, I don&rsquo;t think I ought to continue to cry
      fish in the streets; and now that my uncle has disinherited me, I have, it
      seems to me, a right to an &lsquo;elementary allowance.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dreaming, my poor woman; your daughter is a minor; it is you who
      ought to be feeding her; the law doesn&rsquo;t require her to give you aliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you mean,&rdquo; said Madame Cardinal, &ldquo;that those who have nothing are
      to give to those who have much? A fine thing such a law as that! It&rsquo;s as
      bad as guardians who, for nothing at all, talk about calling the police.
      Yes! I&rsquo;d like to see &lsquo;em calling the police to me! Let &lsquo;em guillotine me!
      It won&rsquo;t prevent my saying that the rich are swindlers; yes, swindlers!
      and the people ought to make another revolution to get their rights; and
      <i>then</i>, my lad, you, and my daughter, and barrister Minard, and that
      little old guardian, you&rsquo;ll all come down under it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that his ex-mother-in-law was reaching stage of exaltation that
      was not unalarming, Cerizet hastened to get away, her epithets pursuing
      him for more than a hundred feet; but he comforted himself by thinking
      that he would make her pay for them the next time she came to his back to
      ask for a &ldquo;convenience.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. SET A SAINT TO CATCH A SAINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      As he approached his own abode, Cerizet, who was nothing so little as
      courageous, felt an emotion of fear. He perceived a form ambushed near the
      door, which, as he came nearer, detached itself as if to meet him.
      Happily, it was only Dutocq. He came for his notes. Cerizet returned them
      in some ill-humor, complaining of the distrust implied in a visit at such
      an hour. Dutocq paid no attention to this sensitiveness, and the next
      morning, very early, he presented himself at la Peyrade&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade paid, as he had promised, on the nail, and to a few sentinel
      remarks uttered by Dutocq as soon as the money was in his pocket, he
      answered with marked coldness. His whole external appearance and behavior
      was that of a slave who has burst his chain and has promised himself not
      to make a gospel use of his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he conducted his visitor to the door, the latter came face to face with
      a woman in servant&rsquo;s dress, who was just about to ring the bell. This
      woman was, apparently, known to Dutocq, for he said to her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha ha! little woman; so we feel the necessity of consulting a barrister?
      You are right; at the family council very serious matters were brought up
      against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, I fear no one. I can walk with my head up,&rdquo; said the person
      thus addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for you,&rdquo; replied the clerk of the justice-of-peace;
      &ldquo;but you will probably be summoned before the judge who examines the
      affair. At any rate, you are in good hands here; and my friend la Peyrade
      will advise you for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is mistaken,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;it is not for what he thinks that
      I have come to consult a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be careful what you say and do, my dear woman, for I warn you you
      are going to be finely picked to pieces. The relations are furious against
      you, and you can&rsquo;t get the idea out of their heads that you have got a
      great deal of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking thus, Dutocq kept his eye on Theodose, who bore the look
      uneasily, and requested his client to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here follows a scene which had taken place the previous afternoon between
      this woman and la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade, we may remember, was in the habit of going to early mass at
      his parish church. For some little time he had felt himself the object of
      a singular attention which he could not explain on the part of the woman
      whom we have just seen entering his office, who daily attended the church
      at, as Dorine says, his &ldquo;special hour.&rdquo; Could it be for love? That
      explanation was scarcely compatible with the maturity and the saintly,
      beatific air of this person, who, beneath a plain cap, called &ldquo;a la
      Janseniste,&rdquo; by which fervent female souls of that sect were recognized,
      affected, like a nun, to hide her hair. On the other hand, the rest of her
      clothing was of a neatness that was almost dainty, and the gold cross at
      her throat, suspended by a black velvet ribbon, excluded the idea of
      humble and hesitating mendicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the day on which the dinner at the Rocher de Cancale was to
      take place, la Peyrade, weary of a performance which had ended by
      preoccupying his mind, went up to the woman and asked her pointblank if
      she had any request to make of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she answered, in a tone of solemnity, &ldquo;is, I think, the
      celebrated Monsieur de la Peyrade, the advocate of the poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am la Peyrade; and I have had, it is true, an opportunity to render
      services to the indigent persons of this quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it, then, be asking too much of monsieur&rsquo;s goodness that he should
      suffer me to consult him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;is not well chosen for such
      consultation. What you have to say to me seems important, to judge by the
      length of time you have been hesitating to speak to me. I live near here,
      rue Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer, and if you will take the trouble to come to
      my office&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not annoy monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least; my business is to hear clients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour&mdash;lest I disturb monsieur&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you choose; I shall be at home all the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will hear another mass, at which I can take the communion. I did
      not dare to do so at this mass, for the thought of speaking to monsieur so
      distracted my mind. I will be at monsieur&rsquo;s house by eight o&rsquo;clock, when I
      have ended my meditation, if that hour does not inconvenience him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but there is no necessity for all this ceremony,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade,
      with some impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a little professional jealousy inspired his ill-humor, for it was
      evident that he had to do with an antagonist who was capable of giving him
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hour appointed, not a minute before nor a minute after, the pious
      woman rang the bell, and the barrister having, not without some
      difficulty, induced her to sit down, he requested her to state her case.
      She was then seized with that delaying little cough with which we obtain a
      respite when brought face to face with a difficult subject. At last,
      however, she compelled herself to approach the object of her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to ask monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if he would be so very good as to
      inform me whether it is true that a charitable gentleman, now deceased,
      has bequeathed a fund to reward domestic servants who are faithful to
      their masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;that is to say, Monsieur de Montyon founded
      &lsquo;prizes for virtue,&rsquo; which are frequently given to zealous and exemplary
      domestic servants. But ordinary good conduct is not sufficient; there must
      be some act or acts of great devotion, and truly Christian
      self-abnegation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religion enjoins humility upon us,&rdquo; replied the pious woman, &ldquo;and
      therefore I dare not praise myself; but inasmuch as for the last twenty
      years I have lived in the service of an old man of the dullest
      description, a savant, who has wasted his substance on inventions, so that
      I myself have had to feed and clothe him, persons have thought that I am
      not altogether undeserving of that prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly under such conditions that the Academy selects its
      candidates,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;What is your master&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pere Picot; he is never called otherwise in our quarter; sometimes he
      goes out into the streets as if dressed for the carnival, and all the
      little children crowd about him, calling out: &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Pere Picot!
      Good-morning, Pere Picot!&rsquo; But that&rsquo;s how it is; he takes no care of his
      dignity; he goes about full of his own ideas; and though I kill myself
      trying to give him appetizing food, if you ask him what he has had for his
      dinner he can&rsquo;t tell you. Yet he&rsquo;s a man full of ability, and he has
      taught good pupils. Perhaps monsieur knows young Phellion, a professor in
      the College of Saint-Louis; he was one of his scholars, and he comes to
      see him very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;your master is a mathematician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; mathematics have been his bane; they have flung him into a
      set of ideas which don&rsquo;t seem to have any common-sense in them ever since
      he has been employed at the Observatory, near here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you must bring testimony proving your long
      devotion to this old man, and I will then draw up a memorial to the
      Academy and take the necessary steps to present it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good monsieur is!&rdquo; said the pious woman, clasping her hands; &ldquo;and if
      he would also let me tell him of a little difficulty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me, monsieur, that to get this prize persons must be really
      very poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly; still, the Academy does endeavor to choose whose who are in
      straitened circumstances, and who have made sacrifices too heavy for their
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrifices! I think I may indeed say I have made sacrifices, for the
      little property I inherited from my parents has all been spent in keeping
      the old man, and for fifteen years I have had no wages, which, at three
      hundred francs a year and compound interest, amount now to a pretty little
      sum; as monsieur, I am sure, will agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words &ldquo;compound interest,&rdquo; which evidenced a certain amount of
      financial culture, la Peyrade looked at this Antigone with increased
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your difficulty is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur will not think it strange,&rdquo; replied the saintly person, &ldquo;that a
      very rich uncle dying in England, who had never done anything for his
      family in his lifetime, should have left me twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the barrister, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing in that but what is
      perfectly natural and proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, I have been told that the possession of this money will
      prevent the judges from considering my claims to the prize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly; because seeing you in possession of a little competence, the
      sacrifices which you apparently intend to continue in favor of your master
      will be less meritorious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never abandon him, poor, dear man, in spite of his faults, though
      I know that this poor little legacy which Heaven has given me is in the
      greatest danger from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! monsieur, let him only get wind of that money, and he&rsquo;d snap it up at
      a mouthful; it would all go into his inventions of perpetual motion and
      other machines of various kinds which have already ruined him, and me,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;your desire is that this legacy should remain
      completely unknown, not only to your master but to the judges of the
      Academy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How clever monsieur is, and how well he understands things!&rdquo; she replied,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And also,&rdquo; continued the barrister, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to keep that money
      openly in your possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For fear my master should find it out and get it away from me? Exactly.
      Besides, as monsieur will understand, I shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry, in order to
      supply the poor dear man with extra comforts, that the sum should bear
      interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the highest possible interest,&rdquo; said the barrister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for that, monsieur, five or six per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; then it is not only about the memorial to the Academy for the
      prize of virtue, but also about an investment of your legacy that you have
      so long been desirous of consulting me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is so kind, so charitable, so encouraging!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The memorial, after I have made a few inquiries, will be easy enough; but
      an investment, offering good security, the secret of which you desire to
      keep, is much less readily obtained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if I dared to&mdash;&rdquo; said the pious woman, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur understands me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? not the least in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I prayed earnestly just now that monsieur might be willing to
      keep this money for me. I should feel such confidence if it were in his
      hands; I know he would return it to me, and never speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade gathered, at this instant, the fruit of his comedy of legal
      devotion to the necessitous classes. The choir of porters chanting his
      praises to the skies could alone have inspired this servant-woman with the
      boundless confidence of which he found himself the object. His thoughts
      reverted instantly to Dutocq and his notes, and he was not far from
      thinking that this woman had been sent to him by Providence. But the more
      he was inclined to profit by this chance to win his independence, the more
      he felt the necessity of seeming to yield only to her importunity;
      consequently his objections were many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he had no great belief in the character of his client, and did
      not care, as the common saying is, to uncover Saint Peter to cover Saint
      Paul; in other words, to substitute for a creditor who, after all, was his
      accomplice, a woman who might at any time become exacting and insist in
      repayment in some public manner that would injure his reputation. He
      decided, therefore, to play the game with a high hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not in want of money, and I am not rich
      enough to pay interest on twenty-five thousand francs for which I have no
      use. All that I can do for you is to place that sum, in my name, with the
      notary Dupuis. He is a religious man; you can see him every Sunday in the
      warden&rsquo;s pew in our church. Notaries, you know, never give receipts,
      therefore I could not give you one myself; I can only promise to leave
      among my papers, in case of death, a memorandum which will secure the
      restitution of the money into your hands. The affair, you see, is one of
      blind confidence, and I am very unwilling to make it. If I do so, it is
      only to oblige a person whose piety and the charitable use she intends to
      make of the proceeds of her little fortune entitle her to my good-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If monsieur thinks that the matter cannot be otherwise arranged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This appears to me the only possible way,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;I shall hope
      to get you six per cent interest, and you may rely that it will be paid
      with the utmost regularity. But remember, six months, or even a year, may
      elapse before the notary will be in a position to repay this money,
      because notaries invest such trust funds chiefly in mortgages which
      require a certain time to mature. Now, when you have obtained the prize
      for virtue, which, according to all appearance, I can readily do for you,
      there will be no reason to hide your little property any longer,&mdash;a
      reason which I fully understand; but you will not be able to withdraw it
      from the notary&rsquo;s hands immediately; and in case of any difficulty
      arising, I should be forced to explain the situation, the manner in which
      you have concealed your prosperity from your master, to whom you have been
      supposed to be wholly devoted. This, as you will see, would put you in the
      position of falsely professing virtue, and would do great harm to your
      reputation for piety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur,&rdquo; said the saintly woman, &ldquo;can it be that any one would
      think me a person who did not speak the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you! my good creature, in business it is necessary to foresee
      everything. Money embroils the best friends, and leads to actions they
      never foresaw. Therefore reflect; you can come and see me again in a few
      days. It is possible that between now and then you will find some better
      investment; and I myself, who am doing at this moment a thing I don&rsquo;t
      altogether like, may have found other difficulties which I do not now
      expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This threat, adroitly thrown out as an afterthought, was intended to
      immediately clinch the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reflected carefully,&rdquo; said the pious woman, &ldquo;and I feel sure that
      in the hands of so religious a man as monsieur I run no risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking from her bosom a little pocket-book, she pulled out twenty-five
      bank notes. The rapid manner in which she counted them was a revelation to
      la Peyrade. The woman was evidently accustomed to handle money, and a
      singular idea darted through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be that she is making me a receiver of stolen property? No,&rdquo; he
      said aloud, &ldquo;in order to draw up the memorial for the Academy, I must, as
      I told you, make a few inquiries; and that will give me occasion to call
      upon you. At what hour can I see you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock, when monsieur goes to take his walk in the Luxembourg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue du Val-de-Grace, No. 9.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; at four o&rsquo;clock; and if, as I doubt not, the result of my
      inquiry is favorable, I will take your money then. Otherwise, if there are
      not good grounds for your application for the prize of virtue there will
      be no reason why you should make a mystery of your legacy. You could then
      invest it in some more normal manner than that I have suggested to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how cautious monsieur is!&rdquo; she said, with evident disappointment,
      having thought the affair settled. &ldquo;This money, God be thanked! I have not
      stolen, and monsieur can make what inquiries he likes about me in the
      quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite indispensable that I should do so,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, dryly,
      for he did not at all like, under this mask of simplicity, the quick
      intelligence that penetrated his thoughts. &ldquo;Without being a thief, a woman
      may very well not be a Sister of Charity; there&rsquo;s a wide margin between
      the two extremes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As monsieur chooses,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;he is doing me so great a service
      that I ought to let him take all precautions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a piously humble bow, she went away, taking her money with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; thought la Peyrade; &ldquo;that woman is stronger than I; she
      swallows insults with gratitude and without the sign of a grimace! I have
      never yet been able to master myself like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began now to fear that he had been too timid, and to think that his
      would-be creditor might change her mind before he could pay her the visit
      he had promised. But the harm was done, and, although consumed with
      anxiety lest he had lost a rare chance, he would have cut off a leg sooner
      than yield to his impulse to go to her one minute before the hour he had
      fixed. The information he obtained about her in the quarter was rather
      contradictory. Some said his client was a saint; otherwise declared her to
      be a sly creature; but, on the whole, nothing was said against her
      morality that deterred la Peyrade from taking the piece of luck she had
      offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he met her at four o&rsquo;clock he found her in the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the money in his pocket he went to dine with Cerizet and Dutocq at
      the Rocher de Cancale; and it is to the various emotions he had passed
      through during the day that we must attribute the sharp and ill-considered
      manner in which he conducted his rupture with his two associates. This
      behavior was neither that of his natural disposition nor of his acquired
      temperament; but the money that was burning in his pockets had slightly
      intoxicated him; its very touch had conveyed to him an excitement and an
      impatience for emancipation of which he was not wholly master. He flung
      Cerizet over in the matter of the lease without so much as consulting
      Brigitte; and yet, he had not had the full courage of his duplicity; for
      he had laid to the charge of the old woman a refusal which was merely the
      act of his own will, prompted by bitter recollections of his fruitless
      struggles with the man who had so long oppressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, during the whole day, la Peyrade had not shown himself the able
      and infallible man that we have hitherto seen him. Once before, when he
      carried the fifteen thousand francs entrusted to him by Thuillier, he had
      been led by Cerizet into an insurrectionary proceeding which necessitated
      the affair of Sauvaignou. Perhaps, on the whole, it is more difficult to
      be strong under good than under evil fortune. The Farnese Hercules, calm
      and in still repose, expresses more energetically the plenitude of
      muscular power than a violent and agitated Hercules represented in the
      over-excited energy of his labors.

      CHAPTER I. PHELLION, UNDER A NEW ASPECT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between the first and second parts of this history an immense event had
      taken place in the life of Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no one who has not heard of the misfortunes of the Odeon, that
      fatal theatre which, for years, ruined all its directors. Right or wrong,
      the quarter in which this dramatic impossibility stands is convinced that
      its prosperity depends upon it; so that more than once the mayor and other
      authorities of the arrondissement have, with a courage that honors them,
      taken part in the most desperate efforts to galvanize the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to meddle with theatrical matters is one of the eternally perennial
      ambitions of the lesser bourgeoisie. Always, therefore, the successive
      saviours of the Odeon feel themselves magnificently rewarded if they are
      given ever so small a share in the administration of that enterprise. It
      was at some crisis in its affairs that Minard, in his capacity as mayor of
      the 11th arrondissement, had been called to the chairmanship of the
      committee for reading plays, with the power to join unto himself as
      assistants a certain number of the notables of the Latin quarter,&mdash;the
      selection being left to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall soon know exactly how near was the realization of la Peyrade&rsquo;s
      projects for the possession of Celeste&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot&rdquo;; let us merely say now that
      these projects in approaching maturity had inevitably become noised
      abroad; and as this condition of things pointed, of course, to the
      exclusion of Minard junior and also of Felix the professor, the prejudice
      hitherto manifested by Minard pere against old Phellion was transformed
      into an unequivocal disposition towards friendly cordiality; there is
      nothing that binds and soothes like the feeling of a checkmate shared in
      common. Judged without the evil eye of paternal rivalry, Phellion became
      to Minard a Roman of incorruptible integrity and a man whose little
      treatises had been adopted by the University,&mdash;in other words, a man
      of sound and tested intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that when it became the duty of the mayor to select the members of the
      dramatic custom-house, of which he was now the head, he immediately
      thought of Phellion. As for the great citizen, he felt, on the day when a
      post was offered to him in that august tribunal, that a crown of gold had
      been placed upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be well understood that it was not lightly, nor without having
      deeply meditated, that a man of Phellion&rsquo;s solemnity had accepted the high
      and sacred mission which was offered to him. He said within himself that
      he was called upon to exercise the functions of a magistracy, a priestly
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To judge of men,&rdquo; he replied to Minard, who was much surprised at his
      hesitation, &ldquo;is an alarming task, but to judge of minds!&mdash;who can
      believe himself equal to such a mission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the family&mdash;that rock on which the firmest resolutions
      split&mdash;had threatened to infringe on the domain of his conscience.
      The thought of boxes and tickets of which the future member of the
      committee could dispose in favor of his own kin had excited in the
      household so eager a ferment that his freedom of decision seemed for a
      moment in danger. But, happily, Brutus was able to decide himself in the
      same direction along which a positive uprising of the whole Phellionian
      tribe intended to push him. From the observations of Barniol, his
      son-in-law, and also by his own personal inspiration, he became persuaded
      that by his vote, always given to works of irreproachable morality, and by
      his firm determination to bar the way to all plays that mothers of
      families could not take their daughters to witness, he was called upon to
      render the most signal services to morals and public order. Phellion, to
      use his own expression, had therefore become a member of the areopagus
      presided over by Minard, and&mdash;still speaking as he spoke&mdash;he was
      issuing from the exercise of his functions, which were both delicate and
      interesting, when the conversation we are about to report took place. A
      knowledge of this conversation is necessary to an understanding of the
      ulterior events of this history, and it will also serve to put into relief
      the envious insight which is one of the most marked traits of the
      bourgeois character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session of the committee had been extremely stormy. On the subject of
      a tragedy entitled, &ldquo;The Death of Hercules,&rdquo; the classic party and the
      romantic party, whom the mayor had carefully balanced in the composition
      of his committee, had nearly approached the point of tearing each other&rsquo;s
      hair out. Twice Phellion had risen to speak, and his hearers were
      astonished at the quantity of metaphors the speech of a major of the
      National Guard could contain when his literary convictions were
      imperilled. As the result of a vote, victory remained with the opinions of
      which Phellion was the eloquent organ. It was while descending the
      stairway of the theatre with Minard that he remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done a good work this day. &lsquo;The Death of Hercules&rsquo; reminded me of
      &lsquo;The Death of Hector,&rsquo; by the late Luce de Lancival; the work we have just
      accepted sparkles with sublime verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;the versification has taste; there are some really
      fine lines in it, and I admit to you that I think this sort of literature
      rather above the anagrams of Master Colleville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Minard, &ldquo;Colleville&rsquo;s anagrams are mere witticisms, which
      have nothing in common with the sterner accents of Melpomene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;I can assure you he attaches the greatest
      importance to that rubbish, and apropos to his anagrams, as, indeed, about
      many other things, he is not a little puffed up. Since their emigration to
      the Madeleine quarter it seems to me that not only the Sieur Colleville,
      but his wife and daughter, and the Thuilliers and the whole coterie have
      assumed an air of importance which is rather difficult to justify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder!&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;one must have a pretty strong head to stand
      the fumes of opulence. Our friends have become so very rich by the
      purchase of that property where they have gone to live that we ought to
      forgive them for a little intoxication; and I must say the dinner they
      gave us yesterday for a house-warming was really as well arranged as it
      was succulent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;have given a few remarkable dinners to which men
      in high government positions have not disdained to come, yet I am not
      puffed up with pride on that account; such as my friends have always known
      me, that I have remained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Monsieur le maire, have long been habituated to the splendid
      existence you have made for yourself by your high commercial talents; our
      friends, on the contrary, so lately embarked on the smiling ship of
      Fortune, have not yet found, as the vulgar saying is, their sea-legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then to cut short a conversation in which Phellion began to think the
      mayor rather &ldquo;caustic,&rdquo; he made as if he intended to take leave of him. In
      order to reach their respective homes they did not always take the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going through the Luxembourg?&rdquo; asked Minard, not allowing
      Phellion to give him the slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall cross it, but I have an appointment to meet Madame Phellion and
      the little Barniols at the end of the grand alley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you and have the pleasure of making my
      bow to Madame Phellion; and I shall get the fresh air at the same time,
      for, in spite of hearing fine things, one&rsquo;s head gets tired at the
      business we have just been about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Minard had felt that Phellion gave rather reluctant assent to his sharp
      remarks about the new establishment of the Thuilliers, and he did not
      attempt to renew the subject; but when he had Madame Phellion for a
      listener, he was very sure that his spite would find an echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fair lady,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;what did you think of yesterday&rsquo;s dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very fine,&rdquo; replied Madame Phellion; &ldquo;as I tasted that soup &lsquo;a la
      bisque&rsquo; I knew that some caterer, like Chevet, had supplanted the cook.
      But the whole affair was dull; it hadn&rsquo;t the gaiety of our old meetings in
      the Latin quarter. And then, didn&rsquo;t it strike you, as it did me, that
      Madame and Mademoiselle Thuillier no longer seemed mistresses of their own
      house? I really felt as if I were the guest of Madame&mdash;what <i>is</i>
      her name? I never can remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Torna, Comtesse de Godollo,&rdquo; said Phellion, intervening. &ldquo;The name is
      euphonious enough to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Euphonious if you like, my dear; but to me it never seems a name at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a Magyar, or to speak more commonly, a Hungarian name. Our own
      name, if we wanted to discuss it, might be said to be a loan from the
      Greek language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; at any rate we have the advantage of being known, not only
      in our own quarter, but throughout the tuition world, where we have earned
      an honorable position; while this Hungarian countess, who makes, as they
      say, the good and the bad weather in the Thuilliers&rsquo; home, where does she
      come from, I&rsquo;d like to know? How did such a fine lady,&mdash;for she has
      good manners and a very distinguished air, no one denies her that,&mdash;how
      came she to fall in love with Brigitte; who, between ourselves, keeps a
      sickening odor of the porter&rsquo;s lodge about her. For my part, I think this
      devoted friend is an intriguing creature, who scents money, and is
      scheming for some future gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;then you don&rsquo;t know the original cause of the
      intimacy between Madame la Comtesse de Godollo and the Thuilliers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a tenant in their house; she occupies the entresol beneath their
      apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but there&rsquo;s something more than that in it. Zelie, my wife, heard
      it from Josephine, who wanted, lately, to enter our service; the matter
      came to nothing, for Francoise, our woman, who thought of marrying,
      changed her mind. You must know, fair lady, that it was solely Madame de
      Godollo who brought about the emigration of the Thuilliers, whose
      upholsterer, as one might say, she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! their upholsterer?&rdquo; cried Phellion,&mdash;&ldquo;that distinguished
      woman, of whom one may truly say, &lsquo;Incessu patuit dea&rsquo;; which in French we
      very inadequately render by the expression, &lsquo;bearing of a queen&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Minard. &ldquo;I did not mean that Madame de Godollo is
      actually in the furniture business; but, at the time when Mademoiselle
      Thuillier decided, by la Peyrade&rsquo;s advice, to manage the new house
      herself, that little fellow, who hasn&rsquo;t all the ascendancy over her mind
      he thinks he has, couldn&rsquo;t persuade her to move the family into the
      splendid apartment where they received us yesterday. Mademoiselle Brigitte
      objected that she should have to change her habits, and that her friends
      and relations wouldn&rsquo;t follow her to such a distant quarter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite certain,&rdquo; interrupted Madame Phellion, &ldquo;that to make up one&rsquo;s
      mind to hire a carriage every Sunday, one wants a prospect of greater
      pleasure than can be found in that salon. When one thinks that, except on
      the day of the famous dance of the candidacy, they never once opened the
      piano in the rue Saint-Dominique!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been, I am sure, most agreeable to the company to have a
      talent like yours put in requisition,&rdquo; remarked Minard; &ldquo;but those are not
      ideas that could ever come into the mind of that good Brigitte. She&rsquo;d have
      seen two more candles to light. Five-franc pieces are her music. So, when
      la Peyrade and Thuillier insisted that she should move into the apartment
      in the Place de la Madeleine, she thought of nothing but the extra costs
      entailed by the removal. She judged, rightly enough, that beneath those
      gilded ceilings her old &lsquo;penates&rsquo; might have a singular effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how all things link together,&rdquo; remarked Phellion, &ldquo;and how, from the
      summits of society, luxury infiltrates itself, sooner or later, through
      the lower classes, leading to the ruin of empires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are broaching there, my dear commander,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;one of the
      most knotty questions of political economy. Many good minds think, on the
      contrary, that luxury is absolutely demanded in the interests of commerce,
      which is certainly the life of States. In any case, this view, which isn&rsquo;t
      yours, appears to have been that of Madame de Godollo, for, they tell me,
      her apartment is very coquettishly furnished; and to coax Mademoiselle
      Brigitte into the same path of elegance she made a proposal to her as
      follows: &lsquo;A friend of mine,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;a Russian princess for whom one of
      the first upholsterers has just made splendid furniture, is suddenly
      recalled to Russia by the czar, a gentleman with whom no one dares to
      trifle. The poor woman is therefore obliged to turn everything she owns
      here into money as fast as possible; and I feel sure she would sell this
      furniture for ready money at a quarter of the price it cost her. All of it
      is nearly new, and some things have never been used at all.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; cried Madame Phellion, &ldquo;all that magnificence displayed before our
      eyes last night was a magnificent economical bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Minard; &ldquo;and the thing that decided Mademoiselle
      Brigitte to take that splendid chance was not so much the desire to renew
      her shabby furniture as the idea of doing an excellent stroke of business.
      In that old maid there&rsquo;s always something of Madame la Ressource in
      Moliere&rsquo;s &lsquo;Miser.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Monsieur le maire, that you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Phellion.
      &ldquo;Madame la Ressource is a character in &lsquo;Turcaret,&rsquo; a very immoral play by
      the late Le Sage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Minard. &ldquo;Well, very likely. But what is certain is
      that, though the barrister ingratiated himself with Brigitte in helping
      her to buy the house, it was by this clever jockeying about the furniture
      that the foreign countess got upon the footing with Brigitte that you now
      see. You may have remarked, perhaps, that a struggle is going on between
      those two influences; which we may designate as the house, and its
      furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, with a beaming expression that
      bore witness to the interest she took in the conversation, &ldquo;it did seem to
      me that the great lady allowed herself to contradict the barrister, and
      did it, too, with a certain sharpness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very marked sharpness,&rdquo; resumed Minard, &ldquo;and that intriguing fellow
      perceives it. It strikes me that the lady&rsquo;s hostility makes him uneasy.
      The Thuilliers he got cheaply; for, between ourselves you know, there&rsquo;s
      not much in Thuillier himself; but he feels now that he has met a tough
      adversary, and he is looking anxiously for a weak spot on which to attack
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s justice,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion. &ldquo;For some time past that
      man, who used to make himself so small and humble, has been taking airs of
      authority in the house which are quite intolerable; he behaves openly as
      the son-in-law; and you know very well, in that affair of Thuillier&rsquo;s
      election he jockeyed us all, and made us the stepping-stone for his
      matrimonial ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I can assure you,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;that at the present time his
      influence is waning. In the first place, he won&rsquo;t find every day for his
      dear, good friend, as he calls him, a fine property worth a million to be
      bought for a bit of bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they did get that house very cheap?&rdquo; said Madame Phellion,
      interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They got it for nothing, as the result of a dirty intrigue which the
      lawyer Desroches related to me the other day. If it ever became known to
      the council of the bar, that little barrister would be badly compromised.
      The next thing is the coming election to the Chamber. Eating gives
      appetite, as they say, and our good Thuillier is hungry; but he begins to
      perceive that Monsieur de la Peyrade, when it becomes a question of
      getting him that mouthful, hasn&rsquo;t his former opportunity to make dupes of
      us. That is why the family is turning more and more to Madame de Godollo,
      who seems to have some very high acquaintances in the political world.
      Besides all this, in fact, without dwelling on the election business,
      which is still a distant matter, this Hungarian countess is becoming,
      every day, more and more a necessity to Brigitte; for it must be owned
      that without the help of the great lady, the poor soul would look in the
      midst of her gilded salon like a ragged gown in a bride&rsquo;s trousseau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Monsieur le maire, you are cruel,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, affecting
      compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but say,&rdquo; returned Minard, &ldquo;with your hand on your conscience,
      whether Brigitte, whether Madame Thuillier could preside in such a salon?
      No, it is the Hungarian countess who does it all. She furnished the rooms;
      she selected the male domestic, whose excellent training and intelligence
      you must have observed; it was she who arranged the menu of that dinner;
      in short, she is the providence of the parvenu colony, which, without her
      intervention, would have made the whole quarter laugh at it. And&mdash;now
      this is a very noticeable thing&mdash;instead of being a parasite like la
      Peyrade, this Hungarian lady, who seems to have a fortune of her own,
      proves to be not only disinterested, but generous. The two gowns that you
      saw Brigitte and Madame Thuillier wear last night were a present from her,
      and it was because she came herself to superintend the toilet of our two
      &lsquo;amphitryonesses&rsquo; that you were so surprised last night not to find them
      rigged in their usual dowdy fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can be the motive,&rdquo; asked Madame Phellion, &ldquo;of this maternal and
      devoted guardianship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear wife,&rdquo; said Phellion, solemnly, &ldquo;the motives of human actions are
      not always, thank God! selfishness and the consideration of vile
      interests. There are hearts in this world that find pleasure in doing good
      for its own sake. This lady may have seen in our good friends a set of
      people about to enter blindly into a sphere they knew nothing about, and
      having encouraged their first steps by the purchase of this furniture, she
      may, like a nurse attached to her nursling, find pleasure in giving them
      the milk of her social knowledge and her counsels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to keep aloof from our strictures, the dear husband!&rdquo; cried
      Minard; &ldquo;but just see how he goes beyond them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;it is neither my intention nor my habit to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same it would be difficult to say more neatly that the Thuilliers
      are geese, and that Madame de Godollo is bringing them up by hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not accept for these friends of ours,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;a
      characterization so derogatory to their repute. I meant to say that they
      were lacking, perhaps, in that form of experience, and that this noble
      lady has placed at their service her knowledge of the world and its
      usages. I protest against any interpretation of my language which goes
      beyond my thought thus limited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyhow, you will agree, my dear commander, that in the idea of
      giving Celeste to this la Peyrade, there is something more than want of
      experience; there is, it must be said, blundering folly and immorality;
      for really the goings on of that barrister with Madame Colleville&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le maire,&rdquo; interrupted Phellion, with redoubled solemnity,
      &ldquo;Solon, the law-giver, decreed no punishment for parricide, declaring it
      to be an impossible crime. I think the same thing may be said of the
      offence to which you seem to make allusion. Madame Colleville granting
      favors to Monsieur de la Peyrade, and all the while intending to give him
      her daughter? No, monsieur, no! that passes imagination. Questioned on
      this subject, like Marie Antoinette, by a human tribunal, Madame
      Colleville would answer with the queen, &lsquo;I appeal to all mothers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, my friend,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, &ldquo;allow me to remind you
      that Madame Colleville is excessively light-minded, and has given, as we
      al know, pretty good proofs of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, my dear,&rdquo; said Phellion. &ldquo;The dinner hour summons us; I think
      that, little by little, we have allowed this conversation to drift toward
      the miry slough of backbiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are full of illusions, my dear commander,&rdquo; said Minard, taking
      Phellion by the hand and shaking it; &ldquo;but they are honorable illusions,
      and I envy them. Madame, I have the honor&mdash;&rdquo; added the mayor, with a
      respectful bow to Madame Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And each party took its way.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE PROVENCAL&rsquo;S PRESENT POSITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The information acquired by the mayor of the 11th arrondissement was by no
      means incorrect. In the Thuillier salon, since the emigration to the
      Madeleine quarter, might be seen daily, between the tart Brigitte and the
      plaintive Madame Thuillier, the graceful and attractive figure of a woman
      who conveyed to this salon an appearance of the most unexpected elegance.
      It was quite true that through the good offices of this lady, who had
      become her tenant in the new house, Brigitte had made a speculation in
      furniture not less advantageous in its way, but more avowable, than the
      very shady purchase of the house itself. For six thousand francs in ready
      money she had obtained furniture lately from workshops representing a
      value of at least thirty thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still further true that in consequence of a service which went deep
      into her heart, Brigitte was showing to the beautiful foreign countess the
      respectful deference which the bourgeoisie, in spite of its sulky
      jealousy, is much less indisposed to give to titles of nobility and high
      positions in the social hierarchy than people think. As this Hungarian
      countess was a woman of great tact and accomplished training, in taking
      the direction which she had thought it wise to assume over the affairs of
      her proteges, she had been careful to guard her influence from all
      appearance of meddlesome and imperious dictation. On the contrary, she
      flattered Brigitte&rsquo;s claim to be a model housekeeper; in her own household
      expenses she affected to ask the spinster&rsquo;s advice; so that by reserving
      to herself the department of luxurious expenses, she had more the air of
      giving information than of exercising supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade could not disguise from himself that a change was taking place.
      His influence was evidently waning before that of this stranger; but the
      antagonism of the countess was not confined to a simple struggle for
      influence. She made no secret of being opposed to his suit for Celeste;
      she gave her unequivocal approval to the love of Felix Phellion, the
      professor. Minard, by whom this fact was not unobserved, took very good
      care, in the midst of his other information, not to mention it to those
      whom it most concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was all the more anxious at being thus undermined by a
      hostility the cause of which was inexplicable to him, because he knew he
      had himself to blame for bringing this disquieting adversary into the very
      heart of his citadel. His first mistake was in yielding to the barren
      pleasure of disappointing Cerizet in the lease of the house. If Brigitte
      by his advice and urging had not taken the administration of the property
      into her own hands there was every probability that she would never have
      made the acquaintance of Madame de Godollo. Another imprudence had been to
      urge the Thuilliers to leave their old home in the Latin quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period, when his power and credit had reached their apogee,
      Theodose considered his marriage a settled thing; and he now felt an
      almost childish haste to spring into the sphere of elegance which seemed
      henceforth to be his future. He had therefore furthered the inducements of
      the countess, feeling that he thus sent the Thuilliers before him to make
      his bed in the splendid apartment he intended to share with them. By thus
      removing them from their old home he saw another advantage,&mdash;that of
      withdrawing Celeste from daily intercourse with a rival who seemed to him
      dangerous. Deprived of the advantage of propinquity, Felix would be forced
      to make his visits farther apart; and therefore there would be greater
      facilities to ruin him in the girl&rsquo;s heart, where he was installed on
      condition of giving religious satisfaction,&mdash;a requirement to which
      he showed himself refractory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all these plans and schemes various drawbacks confronted him. To
      enlarge the horizon of the Thuilliers was for la Peyrade to run the chance
      of creating competition for the confidence and admiration of which he had
      been till then the exclusive object. In the sort of provincial life they
      had hitherto lived, Brigitte and his dear, good friend placed him, for
      want of comparison, at a height from which the juxtaposition of other
      superiorities and elegances must bring him down. So, then, apart from the
      blows covertly dealt him by Madame de Godollo, the idea of the
      transpontine emigration had proved to be, on the whole, a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Collevilles had followed their friends the Thuilliers, to the new
      house near the Madeleine, where an entresol at the back had been conceded
      to them at a price conformable to their budget. But Colleville declared it
      lacked light and air, and being obliged to go daily from the boulevard of
      the Madeleine to the faubourg Saint-Jacques, where his office was, he
      fumed against the arrangement of which he was the victim, and felt at
      times that la Peyrade was a tyrant. Madame Colleville, on the other hand,
      had flung herself into an alarming orgy of bonnets, mantles, and new
      gowns, requiring the presentation of a mass of bills, which led not
      infrequently to scenes in the household which were more or less stormy. As
      for Celeste, she had undoubtedly fewer opportunities to see young
      Phellion, but she had also fewer chances to rush into religious
      controversy; and absence, which is dangerous to none but inferior
      attachments, made her think more tenderly and less theologically of the
      man of her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these false calculations of Theodose were as nothing in the
      balance with another cause for his diminishing influence which was now to
      weigh heavily on his situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had assured Thuillier that, after a short delay and the payment of ten
      thousand francs, to which his dear, good friend submitted with tolerable
      grace, the cross of the Legion of honor would arrive to realize the secret
      desire of all his life. Two months had now passed without a sign of that
      glorious rattle; and the former sub-director, who would have felt such joy
      in parading his red ribbon on the boulevard of the Madeleine, of which he
      was now one of the most assiduous promenaders, had nothing to adorn his
      buttonhole but the flowers of the earth, the privilege of everybody,&mdash;of
      which he was far less proud than Beranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade had, to be sure, mentioned an unforeseen and inexplicable
      difficulty by which all the efforts of the Comtesse du Bruel had been
      paralyzed; but Thuillier did not take comfort in the explanation; and on
      certain days, when the disappointment became acute, he was very near
      saying with Chicaneau in Les Plaideurs, &ldquo;Return my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, no outbreak happened, for la Peyrade held him in leash by the
      famous pamphlet on &ldquo;Taxation and the Sliding-Scale&rdquo;; the conclusion of
      which had been suspended during the excitement of the moving; for during
      that agitating period Thuillier had been unable to give proper care to the
      correction of proofs, about which, we may remember, he had reserved the
      right of punctilious examination. La Peyrade had now reached a point when
      he was forced to see that, in order to restore his influence, which was
      daily evaporating, he must strike some grand blow; and it was precisely
      this nagging and vexatious fancy about the proofs that the barrister
      decided to take as the starting-point of a scheme, both deep and
      adventurous, which came into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the pair were engaged on the sheets of the pamphlet, a
      discussion arose upon the word &ldquo;nepotism,&rdquo; which Thuillier wished to
      eliminate from one of la Peyrade&rsquo;s sentences, declaring that never had he
      met with it anywhere; it was pure neologism&mdash;which, to the literary
      notions of the bourgeoisie, is equivalent to the idea of 1793 and the
      Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally la Peyrade took the ridiculous remarks of his dear, good friend
      pretty patiently; but on this occasion he made himself exceedingly
      excited, and signified to Thuillier that he might terminate himself a work
      to which he applied such luminous and intelligent criticism; after which
      remark he departed and was not seen again for several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Thuillier supposed this outbreak to be a mere passing effect of
      ill-humor; but when la Peyrade&rsquo;s absence grew prolonged he felt the
      necessity of taking some conciliatory step, and accordingly he went to see
      the barrister, intending to make honorable amends and so put an end to his
      sulkiness. Wishing, however, to give this advance an air which allowed an
      honest issue to his own self-love, he entered la Peyrade&rsquo;s room with an
      easy manner, and said, cheerfully:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, it turns out that we were both right: &lsquo;nepotism&rsquo; 
      means the authority that the nephews of popes take in public affairs. I
      have searched the dictionary and it gives no other explanation; but, from
      what Phellion tells me, I find that in the political vocabulary the
      meaning of the word has been extended to cover the influence which corrupt
      ministers permit certain persons to exercise illegally. I think,
      therefore, that we may retain the expression, though it is certainly not
      taken in that sense by Napoleon Landais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade, who, in receiving his visitor, had affected to be extremely
      busy in sorting his papers, contented himself by shrugging his shoulders
      and saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;have you got the last proofs? We ought to be
      getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have sent nothing to the printing-office,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;of
      course there are no proofs. I myself haven&rsquo;t touched the manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Theodose,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t possible that for such
      a trifle you are affronted. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a writer, only as my
      name is on the book I have, I think, the right to my opinion about a
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But &lsquo;Mossie&rsquo; Phellion,&rdquo; replied Theodose, &ldquo;is a writer; and inasmuch as
      you have consulted him, I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t engage him to finish the
      work in which, for my part, I have resolved not to co-operate any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! what temper!&rdquo; cried Thuillier; &ldquo;here you are furious just
      because I seemed to question a word and then consulted some one. You know
      very well that I have read passages to Phellion, Colleville, Minard, and
      Barniol as if the work were mine, in order to see the effect it would
      produce upon the public; but that&rsquo;s no reason why I should be willing to
      give my name to the things they are capable of writing. Do you wish me to
      give you a proof of the confidence I have in you? Madame la Comtesse de
      Godollo, to whom I read a few pages last night, told me that the pamphlet
      was likely to get me into trouble with the authorities; but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      allow what she said to have any influence upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I think that the oracle of the family sees the
      matter clearly; and I&rsquo;ve no desire to bring your head to the scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is nonsense,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;Have you, or have you not, an
      intention to leave me in the lurch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literary questions make more quarrels among friends than political
      questions,&rdquo; replied Theodose. &ldquo;I wish to put an end to these discussions
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Theodose, never have I assumed to be a literary man. I think
      I have sound common-sense, and I say out my ideas; you can&rsquo;t be angry at
      that; and if you play me this trick, and refuse to collaborate any longer,
      it is because you have some other grudge against me that I know nothing
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you call it a trick. There&rsquo;s nothing easier for you than
      not to write a pamphlet; you&rsquo;ll simply be Jerome Thuillier, as before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it was you yourself who declared that this publication would help
      my election; besides, I repeat, I have read passages to all our friends, I
      have announced the matter in the municipal council, and if the work were
      not to appear I should be dishonored; people would be sure to say the
      government had bought me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only to say that you are the friend of Phellion, the
      incorruptible; that will clear you. You might even give Celeste to his
      booby of a son; that alliance would certainly protect you from all
      suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodose,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;there is something in your mind that you
      don&rsquo;t tell me. It is not natural that for a simple quarrel about a word
      you should wish to lose a friend like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, there is,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, with the air of a man who makes
      up his mind to speak out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like ingratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I either; I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Thuillier, hotly; &ldquo;and if you accuse
      me of so base an action, I summon you to explain yourself. We must get out
      of these hints and innuendoes. What do you complain of? What have you
      against a man whom only a few days ago you called your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing and everything,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade. &ldquo;You and your sister are
      much too clever to break openly with a man who, at the risk of his
      reputation, has put a million in your hands. But I am not so simple that I
      don&rsquo;t know how to detect changes. There are people about you who have set
      themselves, in an underhand way, to destroy me; and Brigitte has only one
      thought, and that is, how to find a decent way of not keeping her
      promises. Men like me don&rsquo;t wait till their claims are openly protested,
      and I certainly do not intend to impose myself on any family; still, I was
      far, I acknowledge, from expecting such treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Thuillier, kindly, seeing in the barrister&rsquo;s eye the
      glint of a tear of which he was completely the dupe, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      Brigitte may have been doing to you, but one thing is very certain: I have
      never ceased to be your most devoted friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;since that mishap about the cross I am only good,
      as the saying is, to throw to the dogs. How could I have struggled against
      secret influences? Possibly it is that pamphlet, about which you have
      talked a great deal too much, that has hindered your appointment. The
      ministers are so stupid! They would rather wait and have their hand forced
      by the fame of the publication than do the thing with a good grace as the
      reward of your services. But these are political mysteries which would
      never enter your sister&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Thuillier. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got a pretty observing eye,
      and yet I can&rsquo;t see the slightest change in Brigitte toward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;your eyesight is so good that you have never
      seen perpetually beside her that Madame de Godollo, whom she now thinks
      she can&rsquo;t live without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said Thuillier, slyly, &ldquo;so it is a little jealousy, is it, in
      our mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy!&rdquo; retorted la Peyrade. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the right word,
      but certainly your sister&mdash;whose mind is nothing above the ordinary,
      and to whom I am surprised that a man of your intellectual superiority
      allows a supremacy in your household which she uses and abuses&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it, my dear fellow,&rdquo; interrupted Thuillier, sucking in the
      compliment; &ldquo;she is so absolutely devoted to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit the weakness, but, I repeat, your sister doesn&rsquo;t fit into your
      groove. Well, I say that when a man of the value which you are good enough
      to recognize in me, does her the honor to consult her and devote himself
      to her as I have done, it can hardly be agreeable to him to find himself
      supplanted by a woman who comes from nobody knows where&mdash;and all
      because of a few trumpery chairs and tables she has helped her to buy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With women, as you know very well,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, &ldquo;household affairs
      have the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Brigitte, who wants a finger in everything, also assumes to carry
      matters with a high hand in affairs of the heart. As you are so
      extraordinarily clear-sighted you ought to have seen that in Brigitte&rsquo;s
      mind nothing is less certain than my marriage with Mademoiselle
      Colleville; and yet my love has been solemnly authorized by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see any one attempt to
      meddle with my arrangements!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, without speaking of Brigitte, I can tell you of another person,&rdquo;
       said Theodose, &ldquo;who is doing that very thing; and that person is
      Mademoiselle Celeste herself. In spite of their quarrels about religion,
      her mind is none the less full of that little Phellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you tell Flavie to put a stop to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one knows Flavie, my dear Thuillier, better than you. She is a woman
      rather than a mother. I have found it necessary to do a little bit of
      courting to her myself, and, you understand, while she is willing for this
      marriage she doesn&rsquo;t desire it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake to speak to Celeste myself. It
      shall never be said that a slip of a girl lays down the law to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I don&rsquo;t want you to do,&rdquo; cried la Peyrade. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      meddle in all this. Outside of your relations to your sister you have an
      iron will, and I will never have it said that you exerted your authority
      to put Celeste in my arms; on the contrary, I desire that the child may
      have complete control over her own heart. The only thing I request is that
      she shall decide positively between Felix Phellion and myself; because I
      do not choose to remain any longer in this doubtful position. It is true
      we agreed that the marriage should only take place after you became a
      deputy; but I feel now that it is impossible to allow the greatest event
      of my life to remain at the mercy of doubtful circumstances. And, besides,
      such an arrangement, though at first agreed upon, seems to me now to have
      a flavor of a bargain which is unbecoming to both of us. I think I had
      better make you a confidence, to which I am led by the unpleasant state of
      things now between us. Dutocq may have told you, before you left the
      apartment in the rue Saint-Dominique, that an heiress had been offered to
      me whose immediate fortune is larger than that which Mademoiselle
      Colleville will eventually inherit. I refused, because I have had the
      folly to let my heart be won, and because an alliance with a family as
      honorable as yours seemed to me more desirable; but, after all, it is as
      well to let Brigitte know that if Celeste refuses me, I am not absolutely
      turned out into the cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can easily believe that,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;but as for putting the whole
      decision into the hands of that little girl, especially if she has, as you
      tell me, a fancy for Felix&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said the barrister. &ldquo;I must, at any price, get out of
      this position; it is no longer tenable. You talk about your pamphlet; I am
      not in a fit condition to finish it. You, who have been a man of
      gallantry, you must know the dominion that women, fatal creatures!
      exercise over our whole being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Thuillier, conceitedly, &ldquo;they cared for me, but I did not
      often care for them; I took them, and left them, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I, with my Southern nature, love passionately; and Celeste has
      other attractions besides fortune. Brought up in your household, under
      your own eye, you have made her adorable. Only, I must say, you have shown
      great weakness in letting that young fellow, who does not suit her in any
      respect, get such hold upon her fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right; but the thing began in a childish friendship; she
      and Felix played together. You came much later; and it is a proof of the
      great esteem in which we hold you, that when you made your offer we
      renounced our earlier projects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> did, yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;and with some literary manias&mdash;which,
      after all, are frequently full of sense and wit&mdash;you have a heart of
      gold; with you friendship is a sure thing, and you know what you mean. But
      Brigitte is another matter; you&rsquo;ll see, when you propose to her to hasten
      the marriage, what a resistance she will make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you. I think that Brigitte has always wanted you and
      still wants you for son-in-law&mdash;if I may so express myself. But
      whether she does or not, I beg you to believe that in all important
      matters I know how to have my will obeyed. Only, let us come now to a
      distinct understanding of what you wish; then we can start with the right
      foot foremost, and you&rsquo;ll see that all will go well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;to put the last touches to your pamphlet;
      for, above all things, I think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;we ought not to sink in port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in consequence of the feeling that I am oppressed, stultified by
      the prospect of a marriage still so doubtful, I am certain that not a page
      of manuscript could be got out of me in any form, until the question is
      settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;then how do you present that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, if Celeste&rsquo;s decision be against me, I should wish an
      immediate solution. If I am condemned to make a marriage of convenience I
      ought to lose no time in taking the opportunity I mentioned to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it; but what time do you intend to allow us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that in fifteen days a girl might be able to make up her
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Thuillier; &ldquo;but it is very repugnant to me to let
      Celeste decide without appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I will take that risk; in any case, I shall be rid of
      uncertainty; and that is really my first object. Between ourselves, I am
      not risking as much as you think. It will take more than fifteen days for
      a son of Phellion, in other words, obstinacy incarnate in silliness, to
      have done with philosophical hesitations; and it is very certain that
      Celeste will not accept him for a husband unless he gives her some proofs
      of conversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probable. But suppose Celeste tries to dawdle; suppose she refuses
      to accept the alternative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; said the Provencal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you regard the
      family in Paris; I only know that in my part of the country it is an
      unheard-of thing that a girl should have such liberty. If you, your sister
      (supposing she plays fair in the matter), and the father and mother can&rsquo;t
      succeed in making a girl whom you dower agree to so simple a thing as to
      make a perfectly free choice between two suitors, then good-bye to you!
      You&rsquo;ll have to write upon your gate-post that Celeste is queen and
      sovereign of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t got to that point yet,&rdquo; said Thuillier, with a capable
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, my old fellow,&rdquo; resumed la Peyrade, &ldquo;I must postpone our
      business until after Celeste&rsquo;s decision. Be that in my favor or not, I
      will then go to work, and in three days the pamphlet can be finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;I know what you have had on your mind. I&rsquo;ll talk
      about it with Brigitte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sad conclusion,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;but, unhappily, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather, as you can easily imagine, hear you say of yourself that
      the thing shall be done; but old habits can&rsquo;t be broken up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! do you think I&rsquo;m a man without any will, any initiative of my
      own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! but I&rsquo;d like to be hidden in a corner and hear how you will open the
      subject with your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! I shall open it frankly. I WILL, very firmly said, shall meet
      every one of her objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my poor fellow!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, clapping him on the shoulder, &ldquo;from
      Chrysale down how often have we seen brave warriors lowering their penants
      before the wills of women accustomed to master them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about <i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, making a theatrical
      exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager desire to publish his pamphlet, and the clever doubt thrown upon
      the strength of his will had made him furious,&mdash;an actual tiger; and
      he went away resolved, in case of opposition, to reduce his household, as
      the saying is, by fire and sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home Thuillier instantly laid the question before
      Brigitte. She, with her crude good sense and egotism, pointed out to him
      that by thus hastening the period formerly agreed upon for the marriage,
      they committed the blunder of disarming themselves; they could not be sure
      that when the election took place la Peyrade would put the same zeal into
      preparing for it. &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; said the old maid, &ldquo;just as it has been
      about the cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this difference,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;the cross doesn&rsquo;t depend
      directly upon la Peyrade, whereas the influence he exerts in the 12th
      arrondissement he can employ as he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose he willed, after we have feathered his nest,&rdquo; said Brigitte,
      &ldquo;to work his influence for his own election? He is very ambitious, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This danger did not fail to strike the mind of the future legislator, who
      thought, however, that he might feel some security in the honor and
      morality of la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s honor can&rsquo;t be very delicate,&rdquo; returned Brigitte, &ldquo;when he tries
      to get out of a bargain; and this fashion of dangling a bit of sugar
      before us about getting your pamphlet finished, doesn&rsquo;t please me at all.
      Can&rsquo;t you get Phellion to help you, and do without Theodose? Or, I dare
      say, Madame de Godollo, who knows everybody in politics, could find you a
      journalist&mdash;they say there are plenty of them out at elbows; a couple
      of hundred francs would do the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the secret would get into the papers,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;No, I must
      absolutely have Theodose; he knows that, and he makes these conditions.
      After all, we did promise him Celeste, and it is only fulfilling the
      promise a year earlier&mdash;what am I saying?&mdash;a few months, a few
      weeks, possibly; for the king may dissolve the Chamber before any one
      expects it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose Celeste won&rsquo;t have him?&rdquo; objected Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste! Celeste, indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Thuillier; &ldquo;she <i>must</i> have
      whomsoever we choose. We ought to have thought of that when we made the
      engagement with la Peyrade; our word is passed now, you know. Besides, if
      the child is allowed to choose between la Peyrade and Phellion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you really think,&rdquo; said the sceptical old maid, &ldquo;that if Celeste
      decides for Phellion you can still count on la Peyrade&rsquo;s devotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can I do? Those are his conditions. Besides, the fellow has
      calculated the whole thing; he knows very well that Felix will never bring
      himself in two weeks to please Celeste by going to confession, and unless
      he does, that little monkey will never accept him for a husband. La
      Peyrade&rsquo;s game is very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too clever,&rdquo; said Brigitte. &ldquo;Well, settle the matter as you choose; I
      shall not meddle; all this manoeuvring is not to my taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier went to see Madame Colleville, and intimated to her that she
      must inform Celeste of the designs upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celeste had never been officially authorized to indulge her sentiment for
      Felix Phellion. Flavie, on the contrary, had once expressly forbidden her
      to encourage the hopes of the young professor; but as, on the part of
      Madame Thuillier, her godmother and her confidant, she knew she was
      sustained in her inclination, she had let herself gently follow it without
      thinking very seriously of the obstacles her choice might encounter. When,
      therefore, she was ordered to choose at once between Felix and la Peyrade,
      the simple-hearted girl was at first only struck by the advantages of one
      half of the alternative, and she fancied she did herself a great service
      by agreeing to an arrangement which made her the mistress of her own
      choice and allowed her to bestow it as her heart desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But la Peyrade was not mistaken in his calculation when he reckoned that
      the religious intolerance of the young girl on one side, and the
      philosophical inflexibility of Phellion&rsquo;s son on the other, would create
      an invincible obstacle to their coming together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. GOOD BLOOD CANNOT LIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening of the day on which Flavie had communicated to Celeste the
      sovereign orders of Thuillier, the Phellions called to spend the evening
      with Brigitte, and a very sharp engagement took place between the two
      young people. Mademoiselle Colleville did not need to be told by her
      mother that it would be extremely unbecoming if she allowed Felix to know
      of the conditional approval that was granted to their sentiments. Celeste
      had too much delicacy, and too much real religious feeling to wish to
      obtain the conversion of the man she loved on any other ground than that
      of his conviction. Their evening was therefore passed in theological
      debate; but love is so strange a Proteus, and takes so many and such
      various forms, that though it appeared on this occasion in a black gown
      and a mob cap, it was not at all as ungraceful and displeasing as might
      have been imagined. But Phellion junior was in this encounter, the
      solemnity of which he little knew, unlucky and blundering to the last
      degree. Not only did he concede nothing, but he took a tone of airy and
      ironical discussion, and ended by putting poor Celeste so beside herself
      that she finally declared an open rupture and forbade him to appear in her
      presence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just the case for a lover more experienced than the young savant to
      reappear the very next day, for young hearts are never so near to
      understanding each other as when they have just declared the necessity of
      eternal separation. But this law is not one of logarithms, and Felix
      Phellion, being incapable of guessing it, thought himself positively and
      finally banished; so much so, that during the fifteen days granted to the
      poor girl to deliberate (as says the Code in the matter of beneficiary
      bequests), although he was expected day by day, and from minute to minute
      by Celeste, who gave no more thought to la Peyrade than if he had nothing
      to do with the question, the deplorably stupid youth did not have the most
      distant idea of breaking his ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for this hopeless lover, a beneficent fairy was watching over him,
      and the evening before the day on which the young girl was to make her
      decision the following affair took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday, the day on which the Thuilliers still kept up their weekly
      receptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Phellion, convinced that the housekeeping leakage, vulgarly called
      &ldquo;the basket dance,&rdquo; was the ruin of the best-regulated households, was in
      the habit of going in person to her tradespeople. From time immemorial in
      the Phellion establishment, Sunday was the day of the &ldquo;pot-au-feu,&rdquo; and
      the wife of the great citizen, in that intentionally dowdy costume in
      which good housekeepers bundle themselves when they go to market, was
      prosaically returning from a visit to the butcher, followed by her cook
      and the basket, in which lay a magnificent cut of the loin of beef. Twice
      had she rung her own doorbell, and terrible was the storm gathering on the
      head of the foot-boy, who by his slowness in opening the door was putting
      his mistress in a situation less tolerable than that of Louis XIV., who
      had only <i>almost</i> waited. In her feverish impatience Madame Phellion
      had just given the bell a third and ferocious reverberation, when, judge
      of her confusion, a little coupe drew up with much clatter at the door of
      her house, and a lady descended, whom she recognized, at this untimely
      hour, as the elegant Comtesse Torna de Godollo!
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning a purplish scarlet, the unfortunate bourgeoise lost her head, and,
      floundering in excuses, she was about to complicate the position by some
      signal piece of awkwardness, when, happily for her, Phellion, attracted by
      the noise of the bell, and attired in a dressing-gown and Greek cap, came
      out of his study to inquire what was the matter. After a speech, the
      pompous charm of which did much to compensate for his dishabille, the
      great citizen, with the serenity that never abandoned him, offered his
      hand very gallantly to the lady, and having installed her in the salon,
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I, without indiscretion, ask Madame la comtesse what has procured for
      us the unhoped-for advantage of this visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;to talk with Madame Phellion on a matter
      which must deeply interest her. I have no other way of meeting her without
      witnesses; and therefore, though I am hardly known to Madame Phellion, I
      have taken the liberty to call upon her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, your visit is a great honor to this poor dwelling. But where is
      Madame Phellion?&rdquo; added the worthy man, impatiently, going towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I beg of you, don&rsquo;t disturb her,&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;I have
      heedlessly come at a moment when she is busy with household cares.
      Brigitte has been my educator in such matters, and I know the respect we
      ought to pay to good housekeepers. Besides, I have the pleasure of your
      presence, which I scarcely expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Phellion could reply to these obliging words, Madame Phellion
      appeared. A cap with ribbons had taken the place of the market bonnet, and
      a large shawl covered the other insufficiencies of the morning toilet.
      When his wife arrived, the great citizen made as though he would
      discreetly retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Phellion,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;you are not one too many in the
      conference I desire with madame; on the contrary, your excellent judgment
      will be most useful in throwing light upon a matter as interesting to you
      as to your wife. I allude to the marriage of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marriage of my son!&rdquo; cried Madame Phellion, with a look of
      astonishment; &ldquo;but I am not aware that anything of the kind is at present
      in prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marriage of Monsieur Felix with Mademoiselle Celeste is, I think, one
      of your strongest desires&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have never,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;taken any overt steps for that
      object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that only too well,&rdquo; replied the countess; &ldquo;on the contrary, every
      one in your family seems to study how to defeat my efforts in that
      direction. However, one thing is clear in spite of the reserve, and, you
      must allow me to say so, the clumsiness in which the affair has been
      managed, and that is that the young people love each other, and they will
      both be unhappy if they do not marry. Now, to prevent this catastrophe is
      the object with which I have come here this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot, madame, be otherwise than deeply sensible of the interest you
      are so good as to show in the happiness of our son,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;but,
      in truth, this interest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is something so inexplicable,&rdquo; interrupted the countess, &ldquo;that you feel a
      distrust of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madame!&rdquo; said Phellion, bowing with an air of respectful dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;the explanation of my proceeding is very
      simple. I have studied Celeste, and in that dear and artless child I find
      a moral weight and value which would make me grieve to see her
      sacrificed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, madame,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion. &ldquo;Celeste is, indeed, an
      angel of sweetness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for monsieur Felix, I venture to interest myself because, in the first
      place, he is the son of so virtuous a father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! I entreat&mdash;&rdquo; said Phellion, bowing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and he also attracts me by the awkwardness of true love, which
      appears in all his actions and all his words. We mature women find an
      inexpressible charm in seeing the tender passion under a form which
      threatens us with no deceptions and no misunderstandings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is certainly not brilliant,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, with a faint
      tone of sharpness; &ldquo;he is not a fashionable young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has the qualities that are most essential,&rdquo; replied the countess,
      &ldquo;and a merit which ignores itself,&mdash;a thing of the utmost consequence
      in all intellectual superiority&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, madame,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;you force us to hear things that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That are not beyond the truth,&rdquo; interrupted the countess. &ldquo;Another reason
      which leads me to take a deep interest in the happiness of these young
      people is that I am not so desirous for that of Monsieur Theodose de la
      Peyrade, who is false and grasping. On the ruin of their hopes that man is
      counting to carry out his swindling purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite certain,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;that there are dark depths in
      Monsieur de la Peyrade where light does not penetrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as I myself had the misfortune to marry a man of his description, the
      thought of the wretchedness to which Celeste would be condemned by so
      fatal a connection, impels me, in the hope of saving her, to the
      charitable effort which now, I trust, has ceased to surprise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;we do not need the conclusive explanations by
      which you illumine your conduct; but as to the faults on our part, which
      have thwarted your generous efforts, I must declare that in order to avoid
      committing them in future, it seems to me not a little desirable that you
      should plainly indicate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it,&rdquo; asked the countess, &ldquo;since any of your family have paid
      a visit to the Thuilliers&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my memory serves me,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;I think we were all there the
      Sunday after the dinner for the house-warming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen whole days of absence!&rdquo; exclaimed the countess; &ldquo;and you think
      that nothing of importance could happen in fifteen days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! did not three glorious days in July, 1830, cast down a
      perjured dynasty and found the noble order of things under which we now
      live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it yourself!&rdquo; said the countess. &ldquo;Now, tell me, during that
      evening, fifteen days ago, did nothing serious take place between your son
      and Celeste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something did occur,&rdquo; replied Phellion,&mdash;&ldquo;a very disagreeable
      conversation on the subject of my son&rsquo;s religious opinions; it must be
      owned that our good Celeste, who in all other respects has a charming
      nature, is a trifle fanatic in the matter of piety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree to that,&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;but she was brought up by the
      mother whom you know; she was never shown the face of true piety; she saw
      only the mimicry of it. Repentant Magdalens of the Madame Colleville
      species always assume an air of wishing to retire to a desert with their
      death&rsquo;s-head and crossed bones. They think they can&rsquo;t get salvation at a
      cheaper rate. But after all, what did Celeste ask of Monsieur Felix?
      Merely that he would read &lsquo;The Imitation of Christ.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has read it, madame,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;and he thinks it a book
      extremely well written; but his convictions&mdash;and that is a misfortune&mdash;have
      not been affected by the perusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think he shows much cleverness in not assuring his mistress of
      some little change in his inflexible convictions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, madame, has never received from me the slightest lesson in
      cleverness; loyalty, uprightness, those are the principles I have
      endeavored to inculcate in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, monsieur, that there is no want of loyalty when, in
      dealing with a troubled mind, we endeavor to avoid wounding it. But let us
      agree that Monsieur Felix owed it to himself to be that iron door against
      which poor Celeste&rsquo;s applications beat in vain; was that a reason for
      keeping away from her and sulking in his tent for fifteen whole days?
      Above all, ought he to have capped these sulks by a proceeding which I
      can&rsquo;t forgive, and which&mdash;only just made known to us&mdash;has struck
      the girl&rsquo;s heart with despair, and also with a feeling of extreme
      irritation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son capable of any such act! it is quite impossible, madame!&rdquo; cried
      Phellion. &ldquo;I know nothing of this proceeding; but I do not hesitate to
      affirm that you have been ill-informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, nothing is more certain. Young Colleville, who came home to-day
      for his half-holiday, has just told us that Monsieur Felix, who had
      previously gone with the utmost punctuality to hear him recite has ceased
      entirely to have anything to do with him. Unless your son is ill, I do not
      hesitate to say that this neglect is the greatest of blunders, in the
      situation in which he now stands with the sister he ought not to have
      chosen this moment to put an end to these lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Phellions looked at each other as if consulting how to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, &ldquo;is not exactly ill; but since you mention
      a fact which is, I acknowledge, very strange and quite out of keeping with
      his nature and habits, I think it right to tell you that from the day when
      Celeste seemed to signify that all was at an end between them, a very
      extraordinary change has come over Felix, which is causing Monsieur
      Phellion and myself the deepest anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;the young man is certainly not in his
      normal condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter with him?&rdquo; asked the countess, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night of that scene with Celeste,&rdquo; replied Phellion, &ldquo;after his
      return home, he wept a flood of hot tears on his mother&rsquo;s bosom, and gave
      us to understand that the happiness of his whole life was at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo, &ldquo;nothing very serious happened; but
      lovers always make the worst of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion; &ldquo;but since that night Felix has not made
      the slightest allusion to his misfortune, and the next day he went back to
      his work with a sort of frenzy. Does that seem natural to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is capable of explanation; work is said to be a great consoler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is most true,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;but in Felix&rsquo;s whole personality
      there is something excited, and yet repressed, which is difficult to
      describe. You speak to him, and he hardly seems to hear you; he sits down
      to table and forgets to eat, or takes his food with an absent-mindedness
      which the medical faculty consider most injurious to the process of
      digestion; his duties, his regular occupations, we have to remind him of&mdash;him,
      so extremely regular, so punctual! The other day, when he was at the
      Observatory, where he now spends all his evenings, only coming home in the
      small hours, I took it upon myself to enter his room and examine his
      papers. I was terrified, madame, at finding a paper covered with algebraic
      calculations which, by their vast extent appeared to me to go beyond the
      limits of the human intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;he is on the road to some great discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to madness,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, in a low voice, and with a heavy
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not probable,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo; &ldquo;with an organization so
      calm and a mind so well balanced, he runs but little danger of that
      misfortune. I know myself of another danger that threatens him to-morrow,
      and unless we can take some steps this evening to avert it, Celeste is
      positively lost to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said the husband and wife together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are not aware,&rdquo; replied the countess, &ldquo;that Thuillier and his
      sister have made certain promises to Monsieur de la Peyrade about
      Celeste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We suspected as much,&rdquo; replied Madame Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fulfilment of these pledges was postponed to a rather distant period,
      and subordinated to certain conditions. Monsieur de la Peyrade, after
      enabling them to buy the house near the Madeleine, pledged himself not
      only to obtain the cross for Monsieur Thuillier, but to write in his name
      a political pamphlet, and assist him in his election to the Chamber of
      Deputies. It sounds like the romances of chivalry, in which the hero,
      before obtaining the hand of the princess, is compelled to exterminate a
      dragon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is very witty,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, looking at her husband, who
      made her a sign not to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time now,&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;in fact it would be useless to
      tell you the manoeuvres by which Monsieur de la Peyrade has contrived to
      hasten the period of this marriage; but it concerns you to know that,
      thanks to his duplicity, Celeste is being forced to choose between him and
      Monsieur Felix; fifteen days were given her in which to make her choice;
      the time expires to-morrow, and, thanks to the unfortunate state of
      feeling into which your son&rsquo;s attitude has thrown her, there is very
      serious danger of seeing her sacrifice to her wounded feelings the better
      sentiments of her love and her instincts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can be done to prevent it?&rdquo; asked Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight, monsieur; come this evening in force to the Thuilliers&rsquo;; induce
      Monsieur Felix to accompany you; lecture him until he promises to be a
      little more flexible in his philosophical opinions. Paris, said Henri IV.,
      is surely worth a mass. But let him avoid all such questions; he can
      certainly find in his heart the words and tones to move a woman who loves
      him; it requires so little to satisfy her! I shall be there myself, and I
      will help him to my utmost ability; perhaps, under the inspiration of the
      moment, I may think of some way to do effectually. One thing is very
      certain: we have to fight a great battle to-night, and if we do not ALL do
      our duty valorously, la Peyrade may win it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is not here, madame,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;and I regret it, for perhaps
      your generous devotion and urgent words would succeed in shaking off his
      torpor; but, at any rate, I will lay before him the gravity of the
      situation, and, beyond all doubt, he will accompany us to-night to the
      Thuilliers&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is needless to say,&rdquo; added the countess, rising, &ldquo;that we must
      carefully avoid the very slightest appearance of collusion; we must not
      converse together; in fact, unless it can be done in some casual way, it
      would be better not to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to rely, madame, upon my prudence,&rdquo; replied Phellion, &ldquo;and
      kindly accept the assurance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your most distinguished sentiments,&rdquo; interrupted the countess,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; replied Phellion, gravely, &ldquo;I reserve that formula for the
      conclusion of my letters; I beg you to accept the assurance of my warmest
      and most unalterable gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk of that when we are out of danger,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo,
      moving towards the door; &ldquo;and if Madame Phellion, the tenderest and most
      virtuous of mothers, will grant me a little place in her esteem, I shall
      count myself more than repaid for my trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Phellion plunged headlong into a responsive compliment; and the
      countess, in her carriage, was at some distance from the house before
      Phellion had ceased to offer her his most respectful salutations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Latin-quarter element in Brigitte&rsquo;s salon became more rare and less
      assiduous, a livelier Paris began to infiltrate it. Among his colleagues
      in the municipal council and among the upper employees of the prefecture
      of the Seine, the new councillor had made several very important recruits.
      The mayor, and the deputy mayors of the arrondissement, on whom, after his
      removal to the Madeleine quarter, Thuillier had called, hastened to return
      the civility; and the same thing happened with the superior officers of
      the first legion. The house itself had produced a contingent; and several
      of the new tenants contributed, by their presence, to change the aspect of
      the dominical meetings. Among the number we must mention Rabourdin [see
      &ldquo;Bureaucracy&rdquo;], the former head of Thuillier&rsquo;s office at the ministry of
      finance. Having had the misfortune to lose his wife, whose salon, at an
      earlier period, checkmated that of Madame Colleville, Rabourdin occupied
      as a bachelor the third floor, above the apartment let to Cardot, the
      notary. As the result of an odious slight to his just claims, Rabourdin
      had voluntarily resigned his public functions. At this time, when he again
      met Thuillier, he was director of one of those numerous projected
      railways, the construction of which is always delayed by either
      parliamentary rivalry or parliamentary indecision. Let us say, in passing,
      that the meeting with this able administrator, now become an important
      personage in the financial world, was an occasion to the worthy and honest
      Phellion to display once more his noble character. At the time of the
      resignation to which Rabourdin had felt himself driven, Phellion alone, of
      all the clerks in the office, had stood by him in his misfortunes. Being
      now in a position to bestow a great number of places, Rabourdin, on
      meeting once more his faithful subordinate, hastened to offer him a
      position both easy and lucrative.
    </p>

      &ldquo;Mossieu,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;your benevolence touches me and honors me, but
      my frankness owes you an avowal, which I beg you not to take in ill part:
      I do not believe in &lsquo;railways,&rsquo; as the English call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an opinion to which you have every right,&rdquo; said Rabourdin,
      smiling; &ldquo;but, meanwhile, until the contrary is proved, we pay the
      employees in our office well, and I should be glad to have you with me in
      that capacity. I know by experience that you are a man on whom I can
      count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mossieu,&rdquo; returned the great citizen, &ldquo;I did my duty at that time, and
      nothing more. As for the offer you have been so good as to make to me, I
      cannot accept it; satisfied with my humble fortunes, I feel neither the
      need nor the desire to re-enter an administrative career; and, in common
      with the Latin poet, I may say, &lsquo;Claudite jam rivos, pueri, sat prata
      biberunt.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus elevated in the character of its habitues, the salon Thuillier still
      needed a new element of life. Thanks to the help of Madame de Godollo, a
      born organizer, who successfully put to profit the former connection of
      Colleville with the musical world, a few artists came to make diversion
      from bouillotte and boston. Old-fashioned and venerable, those two games
      were forced to beat a retreat before whist, the only manner, said the
      Hungarian countess, in which respectable people can kill time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Louis XVI., who began by putting his own hand to reforms which
      subsequently engulfed his throne, Brigitte had encouraged, at first, this
      domestic revolution; the need of sustaining her position suitably in the
      new quarter to which she had emigrated had made her docile to all
      suggestions of comfort and elegance. But the day on which occurred the
      scene we are about to witness, an apparently trivial detail had revealed
      to her the danger of the declivity on which she stood. The greater number
      of the new guests, recently imported by Thuillier, knew nothing of his
      sister&rsquo;s supremacy in his home. On arrival, therefore, they all asked
      Thuillier to present them to <i>Madame</i>, and, naturally, Thuillier
      could not say to them that his wife was a figure-head who groaned under
      the iron hand of a Richelieu, to whom the whole household bent the knee.
      It was therefore not until the first homage rendered to the sovereign &ldquo;de
      jure&rdquo; was paid, that the new-comers were led up to Brigitte, and by reason
      of the stiffness which displeasure at this misplacement of power gave to
      her greeting they were scarcely encouraged to pay her any further
      attentions. Quick to perceive this species of overthrow, Queen Elizabeth
      said to herself, with that profound instinct of domination which was her
      ruling passion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t take care I shall soon be nobody in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burrowing into that idea, she came to think that if the project of making
      a common household with la Peyrade, then Celeste&rsquo;s husband, were carried
      out, the situation which was beginning to alarm her would become even
      worse. From that moment, and by sudden intuition, Felix Phellion, that
      good young man, with his head too full of mathematics ever to become a
      formidable rival to her sovereignty, seemed to her a far better match than
      the enterprising lawyer, and she was the first, on seeing the Phellion
      father and mother arrive without the son, to express regret at his
      absence. Brigitte, however, was not the only one to feel the injury that
      the luckless professor was doing to his prospects in thus keeping away
      from her reception. Madame Thuillier, with simple candor, and Celeste with
      feigned reserve, both made manifest their displeasure. As for Madame de
      Godollo, who, in spite of a very remarkable voice, usually required much
      pressing before she would sing (the piano having been opened since her
      reign began), she now went up to Madame Phellion and asked her to
      accompany her, and between two verses of a song she said in her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t your son here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion. &ldquo;His father talked to him very
      decidedly; but to-night there happens to be a conjunction of I don&rsquo;t know
      what planets; it is a great night at the Observatory, and he did not feel
      willing to dispense with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is inconceivable that a man should be so foolish!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de
      Godollo; &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t theology bad enough, that he must needs bring in
      astronomy too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her vexation gave to her voice so vibrating a tone that her song ended
      in the midst of what the English call a thunder of applause. La Peyrade,
      who feared her extremely, was not one of the last, when she returned to
      her place, to approach her, and express his admiration; but she received
      his compliments with a coldness so near to incivility that their mutual
      hostility was greatly increased. La Peyrade turned away to console himself
      with Madame Colleville, who had still too many pretensions to beauty not
      to be the enemy of a woman made to intercept all homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you also, you think that woman sings well?&rdquo; she said, contemptuously,
      to Theodose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I have been to tell her so,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;because
      without her, in regard to Brigitte, there&rsquo;s no security. But do just look
      at your Celeste; her eyes never leave that door, and every time a tray is
      brought in, though it is an hour at least since the last guest came, her
      face expresses disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must remark, in passing, that since the reign of Madame de Godollo
      trays were passed round on the Sunday reception days, and that without
      scrimping; on the contrary, they were laden with ices, cakes, and syrups,
      from Taurade&rsquo;s, then the best confectioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harass me!&rdquo; cried Flavie. &ldquo;I know very well what that foolish girl
      has in her mind; and your marriage will take place only too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know it is not for myself I make it,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;it is a
      necessity for the future of all of us. Come, come, there are tears in your
      eyes! I shall leave you; you are not reasonable. The devil! as that
      Prudhomme of a Phellion says, &lsquo;Whoso wants the end wants the means.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went toward the group composed of Celeste, Madame Thuillier, Madame
      de Godollo, Colleville, and Phellion. Madame Colleville followed him; and,
      under the influence of the feeling of jealousy she had just shown, she
      became a savage mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you sing? These gentlemen wish to hear
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;how can I sing after Madame de Godollo, with
      my poor thread of a voice? Besides, you know I have a cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say that, as usual, you make yourself pretentious and
      disagreeable; people sing as they can sing; all voices have their own
      merits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Colleville, who, having just lost twenty francs at the
      card-tables, found courage in his ill-humor to oppose his wife, &ldquo;that
      saying, &lsquo;People sing as they can sing&rsquo; is a bourgeois maxim. People sing
      with a voice, if they have one; but they don&rsquo;t sing after hearing such a
      magnificent opera voice as that of Madame la comtesse. For my part, I
      readily excuse Celeste for not warbling to us one of her sentimental
      little ditties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is well worth while,&rdquo; said Flavie, leaving the group, &ldquo;to spend
      so much money on expensive masters who are good for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Colleville, resuming the conversation which the invasion of
      Flavie had interrupted, &ldquo;Felix no longer inhabits this earth; he lives
      among the stars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear and former colleague,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;I am, as you are, annoyed
      with my son for neglecting, as he does, the oldest friends of his family;
      and though the contemplation of those great luminous bodies suspended in
      space by the hand of the Creator presents, in my opinion, higher interest
      than it appears to have to your more eager brain, I think that Felix, by
      not coming here to-night, as he promised me he would, shows a want of
      propriety, about which, I can assure you I shall speak my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;is a fine thing, but it has, unfortunately,
      the attribute of making bears and monomaniacs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to mention,&rdquo; said Celeste, &ldquo;that it destroys all religious
      sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken there, my dear child,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo. &ldquo;Pascal,
      who was himself a great example of the falseness of your point of view,
      says, if I am not mistaken, that a little science draws us from religion,
      but a great deal draws us back to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, madame,&rdquo; said Celeste, &ldquo;every one admits that Monsieur Felix is
      really very learned; when he helped my brother with his studies nothing
      could be, so Francois told me, clearer or more comprehensible than his
      explanations; and you see, yourself, he is not the more religious for
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, my dear child, that Monsieur Felix is not irreligious, and
      with a little gentleness and patience nothing would be easier than to
      bring him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring back a savant to the duties of religion!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade.
      &ldquo;Really, madame, that seems to me very difficult. These gentlemen put the
      object of their studies before everything else. Tell a geometrician or a
      geologist, for example, that the Church demands, imperatively, the
      sanctification of the Sabbath by the suspension of all species of work,
      and they will shrug their shoulders, though God Himself did not disdain to
      rest from His labors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that in not coming here this evening,&rdquo; said Celeste, naively,
      &ldquo;Monsieur Felix commits not only a fault against good manners, but a sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dearest,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo, &ldquo;do you think that our meeting
      here this evening to sing ballads and eat ices and say evil of our
      neighbor&mdash;which is the customary habit of salons&mdash;is more
      pleasing to God than to see a man of science in his observatory busied in
      studying the magnificent secrets of His creation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time for all things,&rdquo; said Celeste; &ldquo;and, as Monsieur de la
      Peyrade says, God Himself did not disdain to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my love,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo, &ldquo;God has time to do so; He is
      eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;is one of the wittiest impieties ever uttered;
      those are the reasons that the world&rsquo;s people put forth. They interpret
      and explain away the commands of God, even those that are most explicit
      and imperative; they take them, leave them, or choose among them; the
      free-thinker subjects them to his lordly revision, and from free-thinking
      the distance is short to free actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this harangue of the barrister Madame de Godollo had looked at the
      clock; it then said half-past eleven. The salon began to empty. Only one
      card-table was still going on, Minard, Thuillier, and two of the new
      acquaintances being the players. Phellion had just quitted the group with
      which he had so far been sitting, to join his wife, who was talking with
      Brigitte in a corner; by the vehemence of his pantomimic action it was
      easy to see that he was filled with some virtuous indignation. Everything
      seemed to show that all hope of seeing the arrival of the tardy lover was
      decidedly over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the countess to la Peyrade, &ldquo;do you consider the
      gentlemen attached to Saint-Jacques du Haut Pas in the rue des Postes good
      Catholics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied the barrister, &ldquo;religion has no more loyal
      supporters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; continued the countess, &ldquo;I had the happiness to be
      received by Pere Anselme. He is thought the model of all Christian
      virtues, and yet the good father is a very learned mathematician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said, madame, that the two qualities were absolutely
      incompatible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did say that a true Christian could not attend to any species of
      work on Sunday. If so, Pere Anselme must be an unbeliever; for when I was
      admitted to his room I found him standing before a blackboard with a bit
      of chalk in his hand, busy with a problem which was, no doubt, knotty, for
      the board was three-parts covered with algebraic signs; and I must add
      that he did not seem to care for the scandal this ought to cause, for he
      had with him an individual whom I am not allowed to name, a younger man of
      science, of great promise, who was sharing his profane occupation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celeste and Madame Thuillier looked at each other, and both saw a gleam of
      hope in the other&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you tell us the name of that young man of science?&rdquo; Madame
      Thuillier ventured to say, for she never put any diplomacy into the
      expression of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has not, like Pere Anselme, the saintliness which would
      absolve him in the eyes of monsieur here for this flagrant violation of
      the Sabbath. Besides,&rdquo; added Madame de Godollo, in a significant manner,
      &ldquo;he asked me not to mention that I had met him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know a good many scientific young men?&rdquo; said Celeste,
      interrogatively; &ldquo;this one and Monsieur Felix&mdash;that makes two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear love,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;you are an inquisitive little girl,
      and you will not make me say what I do not choose to say, especially after
      a confidence that Pere Anselme made to me; for if I did, your imagination
      would at once set off at a gallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallop had already started, and every word the countess said only
      added to the anxious eagerness of the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, sarcastically, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all
      surprised if Pere Anselme&rsquo;s young collaborator was that very Felix
      Phellion. Voltaire always kept very close relations with the Jesuits who
      brought him up; but he never talked religion with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my young savant does talk of it to his venerable brother in
      science; he submits his doubts to him; in fact, that was the beginning of
      their scientific intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does Pere Anselme,&rdquo; asked Celeste, &ldquo;hope to convert him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sure of it,&rdquo; replied the countess. &ldquo;His young collaborator, apart
      from a religious education which he certainly never had, has been brought
      up to the highest principles; he knows, moreover, that his conversion to
      religion would make the happiness of a charming girl whom he loves, and
      who loves him. Now, my dear, you will not get another word out of me, and
      you may think what you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! godmother!&rdquo; whispered Celeste, yielding to the freshness of her
      feelings, &ldquo;suppose it were he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the tears filled her eyes as she pressed Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the servant threw open the door of the salon, and, singular
      complication! announced Monsieur Felix Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young professor entered the room, bathed in perspiration, his cravat
      in disorder, and himself out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty hour,&rdquo; said Phellion, sternly, &ldquo;to present yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Felix, moving to the side of the room where Madame
      Thuillier and Celeste were seated, &ldquo;I could not leave before the end of
      the phenomenon; and then I couldn&rsquo;t find a carriage, and I have run the
      whole way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ears ought to have burned as you came,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;for you
      have been for the last half-hour in the minds of these ladies, and a great
      problem has been started about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix did not answer. He saw Brigitte entering the salon from the
      dining-room where she had gone to tell the man-servant not to bring in
      more trays, and he hurried to greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening to a few reproaches for the rarity of his visits and
      receiving forgiveness in a very cordial &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; he
      turned towards his pole, and was much astonished to hear himself addressed
      by Madame de Godollo as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope you will pardon the indiscretion I have, in
      the heat of conversation, committed about you. I have told these ladies
      where I met you this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met me?&rdquo; said Felix; &ldquo;if I had the honor to meet you, madame, I did not
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An almost imperceptible smile flickered on la Peyrade&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me well enough to ask me to keep silence as to where I had met
      you; but, at any rate, I did not go beyond a simple statement; I said you
      saw Pere Anselme sometimes, and had certain scientific relations with him;
      also that you defended your religious doubts to him as you do to Celeste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pere Anselme!&rdquo; said Felix, stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pere Anselme,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;a great mathematician who does not
      despair of converting you. Mademoiselle Celeste wept for joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked around him with a bewildered air. Madame de Godollo fixed
      upon him a pair of eyes the language of which a poodle could have
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I could have given that joy to Mademoiselle
      Celeste, but I think, madame, you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, then I must be more precise,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;and if
      your modesty still induces you to hide a step that can only honor you, you
      can contradict me; I will bear the mortification of having divulged a
      secret which, I acknowledge, you trusted implicitly to my discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Thuillier and Celeste were truly a whole drama to behold; never
      were doubt and eager expectation more plainly depicted on the human face.
      Measuring her words deliberately, Madame de Godollo thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said to these ladies, because I know how deep an interest they take in
      your salvation, and because you are accused of boldly defying the
      commandments of God by working on Sundays, that I had met you this morning
      at the house of Pere Anselme, a mathematician like yourself, with whom you
      were busy in solving a problem; I said that your scientific intercourse
      with that saintly and enlightened man had led to other explanations
      between you; that you had submitted to him your religious doubts, and he
      did not despair of removing them. In the confirmation you can give of my
      words there is nothing, I am sure, to wound your self-esteem. The matter
      was simply a surprise you intended for Celeste, and I have had the
      stupidity to divulge it. But when she hears you admit the truth of my
      words you will have given her such happiness that I shall hope to be
      forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing absurd or mortifying
      in having sought for light; you, so honorable and so truly an enemy to
      falsehood, you cannot deny what madame affirms with such decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Felix, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;will you, Mademoiselle
      Celeste, allow me to say a few words to you in private, without
      witnesses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Celeste rose, after receiving an approving sign from Madame Thuillier.
      Felix took her hand and led her to the recess of the nearest window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I entreat you: wait! See,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the
      constellation of Ursa Minor, &ldquo;beyond those visible stars a future lies
      before us; I will place you there. As for Pere Anselme, I cannot admit
      what has been said, for it is not true. It is an invented tale. But be
      patient with me; you shall soon know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mad!&rdquo; said the young girl, in tones of despair, as she resumed her
      place beside Madame Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix confirmed this judgment by rushing frantically from the salon,
      without perceiving the emotion in which his father and his mother started
      after him. After this sudden departure, which stupefied everybody, la
      Peyrade approached Madame de Godollo very respectfully, and said to her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit, madame, that it is difficult to drag a man from the water
      when he persists in being drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea until this moment of such utter simplicity,&rdquo; replied the
      countess; &ldquo;it is too silly. I pass over to the enemy; and with that enemy
      I am ready and desirous to have, whenever he pleases, a frank and honest
      explanation.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. HUNGARY VERSUS PROVENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Theodose felt himself possessed by two curiosities: How would
      Celeste behave as to the option she had accepted? and this Comtesse Torna
      de Godollo, what did she mean by what she had said; and what did she want
      with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these questions seemed, undoubtedly, to have the right of
      way, and yet, by some secret instinct, la Peyrade felt more keenly drawn
      toward the conclusion of the second problem. He decided, therefore, to
      take his first step in that direction, fully understanding that he could
      not too carefully arm himself for the interview to which the countess had
      invited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning had been rainy, and this great calculator was, of course, not
      ignorant how much a spot of mud, tarnishing the brilliancy of varnished
      boots, could lower a man in the opinion of some. He therefore sent his
      porter for a cabriolet, and about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he drove
      from the rue Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer toward the elegant latitudes of the
      Madeleine. It may well be believed that certain cares had been bestowed
      upon his toilet, which ought to present a happy medium between the
      negligent ease of a morning costume and the ceremonious character of an
      evening suit. Condemned by his profession to a white cravat, which he
      rarely laid aside, and not venturing to present himself in anything but a
      dress-coat, he felt himself being drawn, of necessity, to one of the
      extremes he desired to avoid. However by buttoning up his coat and wearing
      tan instead of straw-colored gloves, he managed to <i>unsolemnize</i>
      himself, and to avoid that provincial air which a man in full dress
      walking the streets of Paris while the sun is above the horizon never
      fails to convey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wary diplomatist was careful not to drive to the house where he was
      going. He was unwilling to be seen from the countess&rsquo; entresol issuing
      from a hired cab, and from the first floor he feared to be discovered
      stopping short on his way up at the lower floor,&mdash;a proceeding which
      could not fail to give rise to countless conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore ordered the driver to pull up at the corner of the rue
      Royale, whence, along a pavement that was now nearly dry, he picked his
      way on tiptoe to the house. It so chanced that he was not seen by either
      the porter or his wife; the former being beadle of the church of the
      Madeleine, was absent at a service, and the wife had just gone up to show
      a vacant apartment to a lodger. Theodose was therefore able to glide
      unobserved to the door of the sanctuary he desired to penetrate. A soft
      touch of his hand to the silken bell-rope caused a sound which echoed from
      the interior of the apartment. A few seconds elapsed, and then another and
      more imperious bell of less volume seemed to him a notification to the
      maid that her delay in opening the door was displeasing to her mistress. A
      moment later, a waiting-woman, of middle age, and too well trained to
      dress like a &ldquo;soubrette&rdquo; of comedy, opened the door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer gave his name, and the woman ushered him into a dining-room,
      severely luxurious, where she asked him to wait. A moment later, however,
      she returned, and admitted him into the most coquettish and splendid salon
      it was possible to insert beneath the low ceilings of an entresol. The
      divinity of the place was seated before a writing-table covered with a
      Venetian cloth, in which gold glittered in little spots among the dazzling
      colors of the tapestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me, monsieur, to finish a letter of some importance?&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrister bowed in sign of assent. The handsome Hungarian then
      concluded a note on blue English paper, which she placed in an envelope;
      after sealing it carefully, she rang the bell. The maid appeared
      immediately and lighted a little spirit lamp; above the lamp was suspended
      a sort of tiny crucible, in which was a drop of sealing-wax; as soon as
      this had melted, the maid poured it on the envelope, presenting to her
      mistress a seal with armorial bearings. This the countess imprinted on the
      wax with her own beautiful hands, and then said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the letter at once to that address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman made a movement to take the letter, but, either from haste or
      inadvertence, the paper fell from her hand close to la Peyrade&rsquo;s feet. He
      stooped hastily to pick it up, and read the direction involuntarily. It
      bore the words, &ldquo;His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs&rdquo;; the
      significant words, &ldquo;For him only,&rdquo; written higher up, seemed to give this
      missive a character of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rdquo; said the countess, receiving the paper, which he had
      the good taste to return to her own hands in order to show his eagerness
      to serve her. &ldquo;Be so good, mademoiselle, as to carry that in a way not to
      lose it,&rdquo; she added in a dry tone to the unlucky maid. The countess then
      left her writing-table and took her seat on a sofa covered with pearl-gray
      satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these proceedings la Peyrade had the satisfaction of making an
      inventory of all the choice things by which he was surrounded. Paintings
      by good masters detached themselves from walls of even tone; on a
      pier-table stood a very tall Japanese vase; before the windows the
      jardinieres were filled with lilium rubrum, showing its handsome reversely
      curling petals surmounted by white and red camellias and a dwarf magnolia
      from China, with flowers of sulphur white with scarlet edges. In a corner
      was a stand of arms, of curious shapes and rich construction, explained,
      perhaps, by the lady&rsquo;s Hungarian nationality&mdash;always that of the
      hussar. A few bronzes and statuettes of exquisite selection, chairs
      rolling softly on Persian carpets, and a perfect anarchy of stuffs of all
      kinds completed the arrangement of this salon, which the lawyer had once
      before visited with Brigitte and Thuillier before the countess moved into
      it. It was so transformed that it seemed to him unrecognizable. With a
      little more knowledge of the world la Peyrade would have been less
      surprised at the marvellous care given by the countess to the decoration
      of the room. A woman&rsquo;s salon is her kingdom, and her absolute domain;
      there, in the fullest sense of the word, she reigns, she governs; there
      she offers battle, and nearly always comes off victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coquettishly lying back in a corner of the sofa, her head carelessly
      supported by an arm the form and whiteness of which could be seen nearly
      to the elbow through the wide, open sleeve of a black velvet
      dressing-gown, her Cinderella foot in its dainty slipper of Russia leather
      resting on a cushion of orange satin, the handsome Hungarian had the look
      of a portrait by Laurence or Winterhalter, plus the naivete of the pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, with the slightly foreign accent which lent an added
      charm to her words, &ldquo;I cannot help thinking it rather droll that a man of
      your mind and rare penetration should have thought you had an enemy in
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Madame la comtesse,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, allowing her to read in his
      eyes an astonishment mingled with distrust, &ldquo;all the appearances, you must
      admit, were of that nature. A suitor interposes to break off a marriage
      which has been offered to me with every inducement; this rival does me the
      service of showing himself so miraculously stupid and awkward that I could
      easily have set him aside, when suddenly a most unlooked-for and able
      auxiliary devotes herself to protecting him on the very ground where he
      shows himself most vulnerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must admit,&rdquo; said the countess, laughing, &ldquo;that the protege showed
      himself a most intelligent man, and that he seconded my efforts
      valiantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His clumsiness could not have been, I think, very unexpected to you,&rdquo;
       replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;therefore the protection you have deigned to give him
      is the more cruel to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a misfortune it would be,&rdquo; said the countess, with charmingly
      affected satire, &ldquo;if your marriage with Mademoiselle Celeste were
      prevented! Do you really care so much, monsieur, for that little
      school-girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that last word, especially the intonation with which it was uttered,
      there was more than contempt, there was hatred. This expression did not
      escape an observer of la Peyrade&rsquo;s strength, but not being a man to
      advance very far on a single remark he merely replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, the vulgar expression, to &lsquo;settle down,&rsquo; explains this situation,
      in which a man, after many struggles and being at an end of his efforts
      and his illusions, makes a compromise with the future. When this
      compromise takes the form of a young girl with, I admit, more virtue than
      beauty, but one who brings to a husband the fortune which is indispensable
      to the comfort of married life, what is there so astonishing in the fact
      that his heart yields to gratitude and that he welcomes the prospect of a
      placid happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always thought,&rdquo; replied the countess, &ldquo;that the power of a man&rsquo;s
      intellect ought to be the measure of his ambition; and I imagined that one
      so wise as to make himself, at first, the poor man&rsquo;s lawyer, would have in
      his heart less humble and less pastoral aspirations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; returned la Peyrade, &ldquo;the iron hand of necessity compels us
      to strange resignations. The question of daily bread is one of those
      before which all things bend the knee. Apollo was forced to &lsquo;get a
      living,&rsquo; as the shepherd of Admetus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sheepfold of Admetus,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo, &ldquo;was at least a royal
      fold; I don&rsquo;t think Apollo would have resigned himself to be the shepherd
      of a&mdash;bourgeois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hesitation that preceded that last word seemed to convey in place of
      it a proper name; and la Peyrade understood that Madame de Godollo, out of
      pure clemency, had suppressed that of Thuillier, had turned her remark
      upon the species and not the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree, madame, that your distinction is a just one,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but
      in this case Apollo has no choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like persons who charge too much,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;but still
      less do I like those who sell their merchandise below the market price; I
      always suspect such persons of trying to dupe me by some clever and
      complicated trick. You know very well, monsieur, your own value, and your
      hypocritical humility displeases me immensely. It proves to me that my
      kindly overtures have not produced even a beginning of confidence between
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, madame, that up to the present time life has never
      justified the belief in any dazzling superiority in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said the Hungarian, &ldquo;perhaps I ought to believe in the
      humility of a man who is willing to accept the pitiable finale of his life
      which I threw myself into the breach to prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I, perhaps,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with a touch of sarcasm, &ldquo;ought to
      believe in the reality of a kindness which, in order to save me, has
      handled me so roughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The countess cast a reproachful look upon her visitor; her fingers
      crumpled the ribbons of her gown; she lowered her eyes, and gave a sigh,
      so nearly imperceptible, so slight, that it might have passed for an
      accident in the most regular breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rancorous,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you judge people by one aspect only.
      After all,&rdquo; she added, as if on reflection, &ldquo;you are perhaps right in
      reminding me that I have taken the longest way round by meddling, rather
      ridiculously, in interests that do not concern me. Go on, my dear
      monsieur, in the path of this glorious marriage which offers you so many
      combined inducements; only, let me hope that you may not repent a course
      with which I shall no longer interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Provencal had not been spoilt by an experience of &ldquo;bonnes fortunes.&rdquo;
       The poverty against which he had struggled so long never leads to affairs
      of gallantry, and since he had thrown off its harsh restraint, his mind
      being wholly given up to the anxious work of creating his future, the
      things of the heart had entered but slightly into his life; unless we must
      except the comedy he had played on Flavie. We can therefore imagine the
      perplexity of this novice in the matter of adventures when he saw himself
      placed between the danger of losing what seemed to be a delightful
      opportunity, and the fear of finding a serpent amid the beautiful flowers
      that were offered to his grasp. Too marked a reserve, too lukewarm an
      eagerness, might wound the self-love of that beautiful foreigner, and
      quench the spring from which he seemed invited to draw. On the other hand,
      suppose that appearance of interest were only a snare? Suppose this
      kindness (ill-explained, as it seemed to him), of which he was so suddenly
      the object, had no other purpose than to entice him into a step which
      might be used to compromise him with the Thuilliers? What a blow to his
      reputation for shrewdness, and what a role to play!&mdash;that of the dog
      letting go the meat for the shadow!
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that la Peyrade was trained in the school of Tartuffe, and the
      frankness with which that great master declares to Elmire that without
      receiving a few of the favors to which he aspired he could not trust in
      her tender advances, seemed to the barrister a suitable method to apply to
      the present case, adding, however, a trifle more softness to the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la comtesse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have turned me into a man who is much
      to be pitied. I was cheerfully advancing to this marriage, and you take
      all faith in it away from me. Suppose I break it off, what use can I&mdash;with
      that great capacity you see in me&mdash;make of the liberty I thus
      recover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Bruyere, if I am not mistaken, said that nothing freshens the blood so
      much as to avoid committing a folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be; but it is, you must admit, a negative benefit; and I am of
      an age and in a position to desire more serious results. The interest that
      you deign to show to me cannot, I think, stop short at the idea of merely
      putting an end to my present prospects. I love Mademoiselle Colleville
      with a love, it is true, which has nothing imperative about it; but I
      certainly love her, her hand is promised to me, and before renouncing it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the countess, hastily, &ldquo;in a given case you would not be averse
      to a rupture? And,&rdquo; she added, in a more decided tone, &ldquo;there would be
      some chance of making you see that in taking your first opportunity you
      cut yourself off from a better future, in which a more suitable marriage
      may present itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, at least, madame, I must be enabled to foresee it definitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This persistence in demanding pledges seemed to irritate the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is only a virtue when it believes without seeing. You
      doubt yourself, and that is another form of stupidity. I am not happy, it
      seems, in my selection of those I desire to benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, it cannot be indiscreet to ask to know in some remote way at
      least, what future your kind good-will has imagined for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very indiscreet,&rdquo; replied the countess, coldly, &ldquo;and it shows
      plainly that you offer me only a conditional confidence. Let us say no
      more. You are certainly far advanced with Mademoiselle Colleville; she
      suits you, you say, in many ways; therefore marry her. I say again, you
      will no longer find me in your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does Mademoiselle Colleville really suit me?&rdquo; resumed la Peyrade;
      &ldquo;that is the very point on which you have lately raised my doubts. Do you
      not think there is something cruel in casting me first in one direction
      and then in the other without affording me any ground to go upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the countess, in a tone of impatience, &ldquo;you want my opinion on
      the premises! Well, monsieur, there is one very conclusive fact to which I
      can bring proof: Celeste does not love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have thought,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, humbly. &ldquo;I felt that I was making a
      marriage of mere convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she cannot love you, because,&rdquo; continued Madame de Godollo, with
      animation, &ldquo;she cannot comprehend you. Her proper husband is that blond
      little man, insipid as herself; from the union of those two natures
      without life or heat will result in that lukewarm existence which, in the
      opinion of the world where she was born and where she has lived, is the ne
      plus ultra of conjugal felicity. Try to make that little simpleton
      understand that when she had a chance to unite herself with true talent
      she ought to have felt highly honored! But, above all, try to make her
      miserable, odious family and surroundings understand it! Enriched
      bourgeois, parvenus! there&rsquo;s the roof beneath which you think to rest from
      your cruel labor and your many trials! And do you believe that you will
      not be made to feel, twenty times a day, that your share in the
      partnership is distressingly light in the scale against their money? On
      one side, the Iliad, the Cid, Der Freyschutz, and the frescos of the
      Vatican; on the other, three hundred thousand francs in good, ringing
      coin! Tell me which side they will trust and admire! The artist, the man
      of imagination who falls into the bourgeois atmosphere&mdash;shall I tell
      you to what I compare him? To Daniel cast into the lion&rsquo;s den, less the
      miracle of Holy Writ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This invective against the bourgeoisie was uttered in a tone of heated
      conviction which could scarcely fail to be communicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, &ldquo;how eloquently you say things which again
      and again have entered my troubled and anxious mind! But I have felt
      myself lashed to that most cruel fate, the necessity of gaining a position&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessity! position!&rdquo; interrupted the countess, again raising the
      temperature of her speech,&mdash;&ldquo;words void of meaning! which have not
      even sound to able men, though they drive back fools as though they were
      formidable barriers. Necessity! does that exist for noble natures, for
      those who know how to will? A Gascon minister uttered a saying which ought
      to be engraved on the doors of all careers: &lsquo;All things come to him who
      knows how to wait.&rsquo; Are you ignorant that marriage, to men of a high
      stamp, is either a chain which binds them to the lowest vulgarities of
      existence, or a wing on which to rise to the highest summits of the social
      world? The wife you need, monsieur,&mdash;and she would not be long
      wanting to your career if you had not, with such incredible haste,
      accepted the first &lsquo;dot&rsquo; that was offered you,&mdash;the wife you should
      have chosen is a woman capable of understanding you, able to divine your
      intellect; one who could be to you a fellow-worker, an intellectual
      confidant, and not a mere embodiment of the &lsquo;pot-au-feu&rsquo;; a woman capable
      of being now your secretary, but soon the wife of a deputy, a minister, an
      ambassador; one, in short, who could offer you her heart as a mainspring,
      her salon for a stage, her connections for a ladder, and who, in return
      for all she would give you of ardor and strength, asks only to shine
      beside your throne in the rays of the glory she predicts for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intoxicated, as it were, with the flow of her own words, the countess was
      really magnificent; her eyes sparkled, her nostrils dilated; the prospect
      her vivid eloquence thus unrolled she seemed to see, and touch with her
      quivering fingers. For a moment, la Peyrade was dazzled by this sunrise
      which suddenly burst upon his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as he was a man most eminently prudent, who had made it his rule
      of life never to lend except on sound and solvent security, he was still
      impelled to weigh the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la comtesse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you reproached me just now for speaking
      like a bourgeois, and I, in return, am afraid that you are talking like a
      goddess. I admire you, I listen to you, but I am not convinced. Such
      devotions, such sublime abnegations may be met with in heaven, but in this
      low world who can hope to be the object of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the countess, with solemnity; &ldquo;such
      devotions are rare, but they are neither impossible nor incredible; only,
      it is necessary to have the heart to find them, and, above all, the hand
      to take them when they are offered to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the countess rose majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade saw that he had ended by displeasing her, and he felt that she
      dismissed him. He rose himself, bowed respectfully, and asked to be
      received again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame de Godollo, &ldquo;we Hungarians, primitive people and
      almost savages that we are, have a saying that when our door is open both
      sides of it are opened wide; when we close it it is double-locked and
      bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That dignified and ambiguous speech was accompanied by a slight
      inclination of the head. Bewildered, confounded by this behavior, to him
      so new, which bore but little resemblance to that of Flavie, Brigitte, and
      Madame Minard, la Peyrade left the house, asking himself again and again
      whether he had played his game properly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. SHOWING HOW NEAR THE TARPEIAN ROCK IS TO THE CAPITOL
    </h2>
    <p>
      On leaving Madame de Godollo, la Peyrade felt the necessity of gathering
      himself together. Beneath the conversation he had just maintained with
      this strange woman, what could he see,&mdash;a trap, or a rich and
      distinguished marriage offered to him. Under such a doubt as this, to
      press Celeste for an immediate answer was neither clever nor prudent; it
      was simply to bind himself, and close the door to the changes, still very
      ill-defined, which seemed offered to him. The result of the consultation
      which Theodose held with himself as he walked along the boulevard was that
      he ought, for the moment, to think only of gaining time. Consequently,
      instead of going to the Thuilliers&rsquo; to learn Celeste&rsquo;s decision, he went
      home, and wrote the following little note to Thuillier:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Thuillier,&mdash;You will certainly not think it extraordinary
  that I should not present myself at your house to-day,&mdash;partly
  because I fear the sentence which will be pronounced upon me, and
  partly because I do not wish to seem an impatient and unmannerly
  creditor. A few days, more or less, will matter little under such
  circumstances, and yet Mademoiselle Colleville may find them
  desirable for the absolute freedom of her choice. I shall,
  therefore, not go to see you until you write for me.

  I am now more calm, and I have added a few more pages to our
  manuscript; it will take but little time to hand in the whole to
  the printer.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ever yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodose de la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later a servant, dressed in what was evidently the first step
      towards a livery, which the Thuilliers did not as yet venture to risk, the
      &ldquo;male domestic,&rdquo; whom Minard had mentioned to the Phellions, arrived at la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s lodgings with the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Come to-night, without fail. We will talk over the whole affair
  with Brigitte.
</pre>
    <p>
      Your most affectionately devoted Jerome Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;evidently there is some hindrance on the other
      side; I shall have time to turn myself round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when the servant announced him in the Thuillier salon, the
      Comtesse de Godollo, who was sitting with Brigitte, hastened to rise and
      leave the room. As she passed la Peyrade she made him a very ceremonious
      bow. There was nothing conclusive to be deduced from this abrupt
      departure, which might signify anything, either much or nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking of the weather and so forth for a time, as persons do who
      have met to discuss a delicate subject about which they are not sure of
      coming to an understanding, the matter was opened by Brigitte, who had
      sent her brother to take a walk on the boulevard, telling him to leave her
      to manage the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she said to Theodose, &ldquo;it was very nice of you not to come
      here to-day like a <i>grasp-all</i>, to put your pistol at our throats,
      for we were not, as it happened, quite ready to answer you. I think,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;that our little Celeste needs a trifle more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, quickly, &ldquo;she has not decided in favor of
      Monsieur Felix Phellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joker!&rdquo; replied the old maid, &ldquo;you know very well you settled that
      business last night; but you also know, of course, that her own
      inclinations incline her that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short of being blind, I must have seen that,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not an obstacle to my projects,&rdquo; continued Mademoiselle Thuillier;
      &ldquo;but it serves to explain why I ask for Celeste a little more time; and
      also why I have wished all along to postpone the marriage to a later date.
      I wanted to give you time to insinuate yourself into the heart of my dear
      little girl&mdash;but you and Thuillier upset my plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I think, has been done without your sanction,&rdquo; said la Peyrade,
      &ldquo;and if, during these fifteen days, I have not talked with you on the
      subject, it was out of pure delicacy. Thuillier told me that everything
      was agreed upon with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Thuillier knows very well that I refused to mix myself
      up on your new arrangements. If you had not made yourself so scarce
      lately, I might have been the first to tell you that I did not approve of
      them. However, I can truly say I did nothing to hinder their success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was too little,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;your active help was
      absolutely necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly; but I, who know women better than you, being one of them,&mdash;I
      felt very sure that if Celeste was told to choose between two suitors she
      would consider that a permission to think at her ease of the one she liked
      best. I myself had always left her in the vague as to Felix, knowing as I
      did the proper moment to settle her mind about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you mean that she refuses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much worse than that,&rdquo; returned Brigitte; &ldquo;she accepts you, and is
      willing to pledge her word; but it is so easy to see she regards herself
      as a victim, that if I were in your place I should feel neither flattered
      nor secure in such a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In any other condition of mind la Peyrade would probably have answered
      that he accepted the sacrifice, and would make it his business to win the
      heart which at first was reluctantly given; but delay now suited him, and
      he replied to Brigitte with a question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you advise? What course had I better take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish Thuillier&rsquo;s pamphlet, in the first place, or he&rsquo;ll go crazy; and
      leave me to work the other affair in your interests,&rdquo; replied Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I in friendly hands? For, to tell you the truth, little aunt, I
      have not been able to conceal from myself that you have, for some time
      past, changed very much to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed to you! What change do you see in me, addled-pate that you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nothing very tangible,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;but ever since that
      Countess Torna has had a footing in your house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy, the countess has done me many services, and I am very
      grateful to her; but is that any reason why I should be false to you, who
      have done us still greater services?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must admit,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, craftily, &ldquo;that she has told you a
      great deal of harm of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally she has; these fine ladies are all that way; they expect the
      whole world to adore them, and she sees that you are thinking only of
      Celeste; but all she has said to me against you runs off my mind like
      water from varnished cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, little aunt, I may continue to count on you?&rdquo; persisted la
      Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; provided you are not tormenting, and will let me manage this
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how you are going to do it?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, with an air of
      great good-humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I shall signify to Felix that he is not to set foot
      in this house again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that possible?&rdquo; said the barrister; &ldquo;I mean can it be done civilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possible; I shall make Phellion himself tell him. He&rsquo;s a man who is
      always astride of principles, and he&rsquo;ll be the first to see that if his
      son will not do what is necessary to obtain Celeste&rsquo;s hand he ought to
      deprive us of his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next, I shall signify to Celeste that she was left at liberty to choose
      one husband or the other, and as she did not choose Felix she must make up
      her mind to take you, a pious fellow, such as she wants. You needn&rsquo;t be
      uneasy; I&rsquo;ll sing your praises, especially your generosity in not
      profiting by the arrangement she agreed to make to-day. But all that will
      take a week at least, and if Thuillier&rsquo;s pamphlet isn&rsquo;t out before then, I
      don&rsquo;t know but what we shall have to put him in a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pamphlet can be out in two days. But is it very certain, little aunt,
      that we are playing above-board? Mountains, as they say, never meet, but
      men do; and certainly, when the time comes to promote the election, I can
      do Thuillier either good or bad service. Do you know, the other day I was
      terribly frightened. I had a letter from him in my pocket, in which he
      spoke of the pamphlet as being written by me. I fancied for a moment that
      I had dropped it in the Luxembourg. If I had, what a scandal it would have
      caused in the quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would dare to play tricks with such a wily one as you?&rdquo; said
      Brigitte, fully comprehending the comminatory nature of la Peyrade&rsquo;s last
      words, interpolated into the conversation without rhyme or reason. &ldquo;But
      really,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;why should you complain of us? It is you who are
      behindhand in your promises. That cross which was to have been granted
      within a week, and that pamphlet, which ought to have appeared a long time
      ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pamphlet and the cross will both appear in good time; the one will
      bring the other,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, rising. &ldquo;Tell Thuillier to come and see
      me to-morrow evening, and I think we can then correct the last sheet. But,
      above all, don&rsquo;t listen to the spitefulness of Madame de Godollo; I have
      an idea that in order to make herself completely mistress of this house
      she wants to alienate all your old friends, and also that she is casting
      her net for Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in point of fact,&rdquo; said the old maid, whom the parting shot of the
      infernal barrister had touched on the ever-sensitive point of her
      authority, &ldquo;I must look into that matter you speak of there; she is rather
      coquettish, that little woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade gained a second benefit out of that speech so adroitly flung
      out; he saw by Brigitte&rsquo;s answer to it that the countess had not mentioned
      to her the visit he had paid her during the day. This reticence might have
      a serious meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later, the printer, the stitcher, the paper glazier having
      fulfilled their offices, Thuillier had the inexpressible happiness of
      beginning on the boulevards a promenade, which he continued through the
      Passages, and even to the Palais-Royal, pausing before all the book-shops
      where he saw, shining in black letters on a yellow poster, the famous
      title:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TAXATION AND THE SLIDING-SCALE by J. Thuillier, Member of the
      Council-General of the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the point of persuading himself that the care he had
      bestowed upon the correction of proofs made the merit of the work his own,
      his paternal heart, like that of Maitre Corbeau, could not contain itself
      for joy. We ought to add that he held in very low esteem those booksellers
      who did not announce the sale of the new work, destined to become, as he
      believed, a European event. Without actually deciding the manner in which
      he would punish their indifference, he nevertheless made a list of these
      rebellious persons, and wished them as much evil as if they had offered
      him a personal affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he spent a delightful morning in writing a certain number of
      letters, sending the publication to friends, and putting into paper covers
      some fifty copies, to which the sacramental phrase, &ldquo;From the author,&rdquo;
       imparted to his eyes an inestimable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the third day of the sale brought a slight diminution of his
      happiness. He had chosen for his editor a young man, doing business at a
      breakneck pace, who had lately established himself in the Passage des
      Panoramas, where he was paying a ruinous rent. He was the nephew of Barbet
      the publisher, whom Brigitte had had as a tenant in the rue
      Saint-Dominique d&rsquo;Enfer. This Barbet junior was a youth who flinched at
      nothing; and when he was presented to Thuillier by his uncle, he pledged
      himself, provided he was not shackled in his advertising, to sell off the
      first edition and print a second within a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Thuillier had spent about fifteen hundred francs himself on costs of
      publication, such, for instance, as copies sent in great profusion to the
      newspapers; but at the close of the third day <i>seven</i> copies only had
      been sold, and three of those on credit. It might be believed that in
      revealing to the horror-stricken Thuillier this paltry result the young
      publisher would have lost at least something of his assurance. On the
      contrary, this Guzman of the book-trade hastened to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted at what has happened. If we had sold a hundred copies it
      would trouble me far more than the fifteen hundred now on our hands;
      that&rsquo;s what I call hanging fire; whereas this insignificant sale only
      proves that the edition will go off like a rocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, who thought this view paradoxical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; said Barbet, &ldquo;when we get notices in the newspapers. Newspaper
      notices are only useful to arouse attention. &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; says the public,
      &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a publication that must be interesting.&rsquo; The title is good,&mdash;&lsquo;Taxation
      and the Sliding-Scale,&rsquo;&mdash;but I find that the more piquant a title is,
      the more buyers distrust it, they have been taken in so often; they wait
      for the notices. On the other hand, for books that are destined to have
      only a limited sale, a hundred ready-made purchasers will come in at once,
      but after that, good-bye to them; we don&rsquo;t place another copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;that the sale is hopeless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think it is on the best track. When the &lsquo;Debats,&rsquo; the
      &lsquo;Constitutionnel,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Siecle,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Presse&rsquo; have reviewed it,
      especially if the &lsquo;Debats&rsquo; mauls it (they are ministerial, you know), it
      won&rsquo;t be a week before the whole edition is snapped up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that easily enough,&rdquo; replied Thuillier; &ldquo;but how are we to get
      hold of those gentlemen of the press?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; said Barbet. &ldquo;I am on the best of terms with
      the managing editors; they say the devil is in me, and that I remind them
      of Ladvocat in his best days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, my dear fellow, you ought to have seen to this earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! excuse me, papa Thuillier; there&rsquo;s only one way of seeing to the
      journalists; but as you grumbled about the fifteen hundred francs for the
      advertisements, I did not venture to propose to you another extra
      expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What expense?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were nominated to the municipal council, where was the plan
      mooted?&rdquo; asked the publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! in my own house,&rdquo; replied Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, in your own house, but at a dinner, followed by a ball,
      and the ball itself crowned by a supper. Well, my dear master, there are
      no two ways to do this business; Boileau says:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;All is done through the palate, and not through the mind;
  And it is by our dinners we govern mankind.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I ought to give a dinner to those journalists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but not at your own house; for these journalists, you see, if women
      are present, get stupid; they have to behave themselves. And, besides, it
      isn&rsquo;t dinner they want, but a breakfast&mdash;that suits them best. In the
      evening these gentlemen have to go to first representations, and make up
      their papers, not to speak of their own little private doings; whereas in
      the mornings they have nothing to think about. As for me, it is always
      breakfasts that I give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that costs money, breakfasts like that,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;journalists
      are gourmands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! twenty francs a head, without wine. Say you have ten of them; three
      hundred francs will see you handsomely through the whole thing. In fact,
      as a matter of economy, breakfasts are preferable; for a dinner you
      wouldn&rsquo;t get off under five hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you talk, young man!&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it! everybody knows it costs dear to get elected to the Chamber;
      and all this favors your nomination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I invite those gentlemen? Must I go and see them myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; send them your pamphlet and appoint them to meet you at
      Philippe&rsquo;s or Vefour&rsquo;s&mdash;they&rsquo;ll understand perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten guests,&rdquo; said Thuillier, beginning to enter into the idea. &ldquo;I did not
      know there were so many leading journals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not,&rdquo; said the publisher; &ldquo;but we must have the little dogs as
      well, for they bark loudest. This breakfast is certain to make a noise,
      and if you don&rsquo;t ask them they&rsquo;ll think you pick and choose, and everyone
      excluded will be your enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think it is enough merely to send the invitations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll make the list, and you can write the notes and send them to me.
      I&rsquo;ll see that they are delivered; some of them I shall take in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were sure,&rdquo; said Thuillier, undecidedly, &ldquo;that this expense would
      have the desired effect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If I were sure</i>,&mdash;that&rsquo;s a queer thing to say,&rdquo; said Barbet.
      &ldquo;My dear master, this is money placed on mortgage; for it, I will
      guarantee the sale of fifteen hundred copies,&mdash;say at forty sous
      apiece; allowing the discounts, that makes three thousand francs. You see
      that your costs and extra costs are covered, and more than covered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, turning to go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to la Peyrade about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my dear master; but decide soon, for nothing gets mouldy
      so fast as a book; write hot, serve hot, and buy hot,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      rule for authors, publishers, and public; all is bosh outside of it, and
      no good to touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When la Peyrade was consulted, he did not think in his heart that the
      remedy was heroic, but he had now come to feel the bitterest animosity
      against Thuillier, so that he was well pleased to see this new tax levied
      on his self-important inexperience and pompous silliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Thuillier, the mania for posing as a publicist and getting himself
      talked about so possessed him that although he moaned over this fresh
      bleeding of his purse, he had decided on the sacrifice before he even
      spoke to la Peyrade. The reserved and conditional approval of the latter
      was, therefore, more than enough to settle his determination, and the same
      evening he returned to Barbet junior and asked for the list of guests whom
      he ought to invite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbet gaily produced his little catalogue. Instead of the ten guests
      originally mentioned, there proved to be fifteen, not counting himself or
      la Peyrade, whom Thuillier wanted to second him in this encounter with a
      set of men among whom he himself felt he should be a little out of place.
      Casting his eyes over the list, he exclaimed, vehemently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! my dear fellow, here are names of papers nobody ever heard of.
      Where&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Moralisateur,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Lanterne de Diogene,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Pelican,&rsquo; the
      &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful how you scorn the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Barbet; &ldquo;why, that&rsquo;s the paper of the 12th arrondissement, from which you
      expect to be elected; its patrons are those big tanners of the Mouffetard
      quarter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let that go&mdash;but the &lsquo;Pelican&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Pelican&rsquo;? that&rsquo;s a paper you&rsquo;ll find in every dentist&rsquo;s
      waiting-room; dentists are the first <i>puffists</i> in the world! How
      many teeth do you suppose are daily pulled in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, nonsense,&rdquo; said Thuillier, who proceeded to mark out certain
      names, reducing the whole number present to fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one falls off we shall be thirteen,&rdquo; remarked Barbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Thuillier, the free-thinker, &ldquo;do you suppose I give in to
      that superstition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The list being finally closed and settled at fourteen, Thuillier seated
      himself at the publisher&rsquo;s desk and wrote the invitations, naming, in view
      of the urgency of the purpose, the next day but one for the meeting,
      Barbet having assured him that no journalist would object to the shortness
      of the invitation. The meeting was appointed at Vefour&rsquo;s, the restaurant
      par excellence of the bourgeoisie and all provincials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbet arrived on the day named before Thuillier, who appeared in a cravat
      which alone was enough to create a stir in the satirical circle in which
      he was about to produce himself. The publisher, on his own authority, had
      changed various articles on the bill of fare as selected by his patron,
      more especially directing that the champagne, ordered in true bourgeois
      fashion to be served with the dessert, should be placed on the table at
      the beginning of breakfast, with several dishes of shrimps, a necessity
      which had not occurred to the amphitryon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier, who gave a lip-approval to these amendments, was followed by la
      Peyrade; and then came a long delay in the arrival of the guests.
      Breakfast was ordered at eleven o&rsquo;clock; at a quarter to twelve not a
      journalist had appeared. Barbet, who was never at a loss, made the
      consoling remark that breakfasts at restaurants were like funerals, where,
      as every one knew, eleven o&rsquo;clock meant mid-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, shortly before that hour, two gentlemen, with pointed beards,
      exhaling a strong odor of tobacco, made their appearance. Thuillier
      thanked them effusively for the &ldquo;honor&rdquo; they had done him; after which
      came another long period of waiting, of which we shall not relate the
      tortures. At one o&rsquo;clock the assembled contingent comprised five of the
      invited guests, Barbet and la Peyrade not included. It is scarcely
      necessary to say that none of the self-respecting journalists of the
      better papers had taken any notice of the absurd invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast now had to be served to this reduced number. A few polite
      phrases that reached Thuillier&rsquo;s ears about the &ldquo;immense&rdquo; interest of his
      publication, failed to blind him to the bitterness of his discomfiture;
      and without the gaiety of the publisher, who had taken in hand the reins
      his patron, gloomy as Hippolytus on the road to Mycenae, let fall, nothing
      could have surpassed the glum and glacial coldness of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the oysters were removed, the champagne and chablis which had washed
      them down had begun, nevertheless, to raise the thermometer, when, rushing
      into the room where the banquet was taking place, a young man in a cap
      conveyed to Thuillier a most unexpected and crushing blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said the new-comer to Barbet (he was a clerk in the bookseller&rsquo;s
      shop), &ldquo;we are done for! The police have made a raid upon us; a commissary
      and two men have come to seize monsieur&rsquo;s pamphlet. Here&rsquo;s a paper they
      have given me for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said Barbet, handing the document to la Peyrade, his
      customary assurance beginning to forsake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A summons to appear at once before the court of assizes,&rdquo; said la
      Peyrade, after reading a few lines of the sheriff&rsquo;s scrawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier had turned as pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you fulfil all the necessary formalities?&rdquo; he said to Barbet, in a
      choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a matter of formalities,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;it is a seizure
      for what is called press misdemeanor, exciting contempt and hatred of the
      government; you probably have the same sort of compliment awaiting you at
      home, my poor Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is treachery!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, losing his head completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, my dear fellow! you know very well what you put in your
      pamphlet; for my part, I don&rsquo;t see anything worth whipping a cat for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some misunderstanding,&rdquo; said Barbet, recovering courage; &ldquo;it will
      all be explained, and the result will be a fine cause of complaint&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      it, messieurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter, pens and ink!&rdquo; cried one of the journalists thus appealed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! you&rsquo;ll have time to write your article later,&rdquo; said another of
      the brotherhood; &ldquo;what has a bombshell to do with this &lsquo;filet saute&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, of course, was a parody on the famous speech of Charles XII., King
      of Sweden, when a shot interrupted him while dictating to a secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said Thuillier, rising, &ldquo;I am sure you will excuse me for
      leaving you. If, as Monsieur Barbet thinks, there is some
      misunderstanding, it ought to be explained at once; I must therefore, with
      your permission, go to the police court. La Peyrade,&rdquo; he added in a
      significant tone, &ldquo;you will not refuse, I presume, to accompany me. And
      you, my dear publisher, you would do well to come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, faith!&rdquo; said Barbet, &ldquo;when I breakfast, I breakfast; if the police
      have committed a blunder, so much the worse for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the matter is serious?&rdquo; cried Thuillier, in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should say, what is perfectly true, that I had never read a line
      of your pamphlet. One thing is very annoying; those damned juries hate
      beards, and I must cut off mine if I&rsquo;m compelled to appear in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear amphitryon, sit down again,&rdquo; said the editor of the &ldquo;Echo
      de la Bievre,&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stand by you; I&rsquo;ve already written an article in my
      head which will stir up all the tanners in Paris; and, let me tell you,
      that honorable corporation is a power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, &ldquo;no; a man like me cannot rest an hour
      under such an accusation as this. Continue your breakfast without us; I
      hope soon to see you again. La Peyrade, are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s charming, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Barbet, when Thuillier and his counsel had
      left the room. &ldquo;To ask me to leave a breakfast after the oysters, and go
      and talk with the police! Come, messieurs, close up the ranks,&rdquo; he added,
      gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; said one of the hungry journalists, who had cast his eyes into
      the garden of the Palais-Royal, on which the dining-room of the restaurant
      opened, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Barbanchu going by; suppose I call him in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Barbet junior, &ldquo;have him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbanchu! Barbanchu!&rdquo; called out the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbanchu, his hat being over his eyes, was some time in discovering the
      cloud above him whence the voice proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, up here!&rdquo; called the voice, which seemed to Barbanchu celestial
      when he saw himself hailed by a man with a glass of champagne in his hand.
      Then, as he seemed to hesitate, the party above called out in chorus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up! come up! <i>There&rsquo;s fat to be had</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Thuillier left the office of the public prosecutor he could no longer
      have any illusions. The case against him was serious, and the stern manner
      in which he had been received made him see that when the trial came up he
      would be treated without mercy. Then, as always happens among accomplices
      after the non-success of an affair they have done in common, he turned
      upon la Peyrade in the sharpest manner: La Peyrade had paid no attention
      to what he wrote; he had given full swing to his stupid Saint-Simonian
      ideas; <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t care for the consequences; it was not <i>he</i>
      who would have to pay the fine and go to prison! Then, when la Peyrade
      answered that the matter did not look to him serious, and he expected to
      get a verdict of acquittal without difficulty, Thuillier burst forth upon
      him, vehemently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! the thing is plain enough; monsieur sees nothing in it? Well, I
      shall not put my honor and my fortune into the hands of a little upstart
      like yourself; I shall take some great lawyer if the case comes to trial.
      I&rsquo;ve had enough of your collaboration by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the injustice of these remarks la Peyrade felt his anger rising.
      However, he saw himself disarmed, and not wishing to come to an open
      rupture, he parted from Thuillier, saying that he forgave a man excited by
      fear, and would go to see him later in the afternoon, when he would
      probably be calmer; they could then decide on what steps they had better
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, about four o&rsquo;clock, the Provencal arrived at the house in the
      Place de la Madeleine. Thuillier&rsquo;s irritation was quieted, but frightful
      consternation had taken its place. If the executioner were coming in half
      an hour to lead him to the scaffold he could not have been more utterly
      unstrung and woe-begone. When la Peyrade entered Madame Thuillier was
      trying to make him take an infusion of linden-leaves. The poor woman had
      come out of her usual apathy, and proved herself, beside the present
      Sabinus, another Eponina.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Brigitte, who presently appeared, bearing a foot-bath, she had no
      mercy or restraint towards Theodose; her sharp and bitter reproaches,
      which were out of all proportion to the fault, even supposing him to have
      committed one would have driven a man of the most placid temperament
      beside himself. La Peyrade felt that all was lost to him in the Thuillier
      household, where they now seemed to seize with joy the occasion to break
      their word to him and to give free rein to revolting ingratitude. On an
      ironical allusion by Brigitte to the manner in which he decorated his
      friends, la Peyrade rose and took leave, without any effort being made to
      retain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking about the streets for awhile, la Peyrade, in the midst of
      his indignation, turned to thoughts of Madame de Godollo, whose image, to
      tell the truth, had been much in his mind since their former interview.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &lsquo;TWAS THUS THEY BADE ADIEU
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not only once when the countess met the barrister at the Thuilliers had
      she left the room; but the same performance took place at each of their
      encounters; and la Peyrade had convinced himself, without knowing exactly
      why, that in each case, this affectation of avoiding him, signified
      something that was not indifference. To have paid her another visit
      immediately would certainly have been very unskilful; but now a sufficient
      time had elapsed to prove him to be a man who was master of himself.
      Accordingly, he returned upon his steps to the Boulevard de la Madeleine,
      and without asking the porter if the countess was at home, he passed the
      lodge as if returning to the Thuilliers&rsquo;, and rang the bell of the
      entresol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid who opened the door asked him, as before, to wait until she
      notified her mistress; but, on this occasion, instead of showing him into
      the dining-room, she ushered him into a little room arranged as a library.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited long, and knew not what to think of the delay. Still, he
      reassured himself with the thought that if she meant to dismiss him he
      would not have been asked to wait at all. Finally the maid reappeared, but
      even then it was not to introduce him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la comtesse,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;was engaged on a matter of
      business, but she begged monsieur be so kind as to wait, and to amuse
      himself with the books in the library, because she might be detained
      longer than she expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The excuse, both in form and substance, was certainly not discouraging,
      and la Peyrade looked about him to fulfil the behest to amuse himself.
      Without opening any of the carved rosewood bookcases, which enclosed a
      collection of the most elegantly bound volumes he had ever laid his eyes
      upon, he saw on an oblong table with claw feet a pell-mell of books
      sufficient for the amusement of a man whose attention was keenly alive
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he opened one after another of the various volumes, he began to
      fancy that a feast of Tantalus had been provided for him: one book was
      English, another German, a third Russian; there was even one in cabalistic
      letters that seemed Turkish. Was this a polyglottic joke the countess had
      arranged for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      One volume, however, claimed particular attention. The binding, unlike
      those of the other books, was less rich than dainty. Lying by itself at a
      corner of the table, it was open, with the back turned up, the edges of
      the leaves resting on the green table-cloth in the shape of a tent. La
      Peyrade took it up, being careful not to lose the page which it seemed to
      have been some one&rsquo;s intention to mark. It proved to be a volume of the
      illustrated edition of Monsieur Scribe&rsquo;s works. The engraving which
      presented itself on the open page to la Peyrade&rsquo;s eyes, was entitled &ldquo;The
      Hatred of a Woman&rdquo;; the principal personage of which is a young widow,
      desperately pursuing a poor young man who cannot help himself. There is
      hatred all round. Through her devilries she almost makes him lose his
      reputation, and does make him miss a rich marriage; but the end is that
      she gives him more than she took away from him, and makes a husband of the
      man who was thought her victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      If chance had put this volume apart from the rest, and had left it open at
      the precise page where la Peyrade found it marked, it must be owned that,
      after what had passed between himself and the countess, chance can
      sometimes seem clever and adroit. As he stood there, thinking over the
      significance which this more or less accidental combination might have, la
      Peyrade read through a number of scenes to see whether in the details as
      well as the general whole they applied to the present situation. While
      thus employed, the sound of an opening door was heard, and he recognized
      the silvery and slightly drawling voice of the countess, who was evidently
      accompanying some visitor to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may promise the ambassadress,&rdquo; said a man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;that you will
      honor her ball with your presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, commander, if my headache, which is just beginning to get a little
      better, is kind enough to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir, then, fairest lady,&rdquo; said the gentleman. After which the doors
      were closed, and silence reigned once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title of commander reassured la Peyrade somewhat, for it was not the
      rank of a young dandy. He was nevertheless curious to know who this
      personage was with whom the countess had been shut up so long. Hearing no
      one approach the room he was in, he went to the window and opened the
      curtain cautiously, prepared to let it drop back at the slightest noise,
      and to make a quick right-about-face to avoid being caught, &ldquo;flagrante
      delicto,&rdquo; in curiosity. An elegant coupe, standing at a little distance,
      was now driven up to the house, a footman in showy livery hastened to open
      the door, and a little old man, with a light and jaunty movement, though
      it was evident he was one of those relics of the past who have not yet
      abandoned powder, stepped quickly into the carriage, which was then driven
      rapidly away. La Peyrade had time to observe on his breast a perfect
      string of decorations. This, combined with the powdered hair, was certain
      evidence of a diplomatic individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade had picked up his book once more, when a bell from the inner
      room sounded, quickly followed by the appearance of the maid, who invited
      him to follow her. The Provencal took care <i>not</i> to replace the
      volume where he found it, and an instant later he entered the presence of
      the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pained expression was visible on the handsome face of the foreign
      countess, who, however, lost nothing of her charm in the languor that
      seemed to overcome her. On the sofa beside her was a manuscript written on
      gilt-edged paper, in that large and opulent handwriting which indicates an
      official communication from some ministerial office or chancery. She held
      in her hand a crystal bottle with a gold stopper, from which she
      frequently inhaled the contents, and a strong odor of English vinegar
      pervaded the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you are ill, madame,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is nothing,&rdquo; replied the countess; &ldquo;only a headache, to which I am
      very subject. But you, monsieur, what has become of you? I was beginning
      to lose all hope of ever seeing you again. Have you come to announce to me
      some great news? The period of your marriage with Mademoiselle Colleville
      is probably so near that I think you can speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This opening disconcerted la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame,&rdquo; he answered, in a tone that was almost tart, &ldquo;you, it seems
      to me, must know too well everything that goes on in the Thuillier
      household not to be aware that the event you speak of is not approaching,
      and, I may add, not probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I assure you, I know nothing; I have strictly forbidden myself from
      taking any further interest in an affair which I felt I had meddled with
      very foolishly. Mademoiselle Brigitte and I talk of everything except
      Celeste&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is no doubt the desire to allow me perfect freedom in the matter
      that induces you to take flight whenever I have the honor to meet you in
      the Thuillier salon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;that ought to be the reason that makes me leave
      the room; else, why should I be so distant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame, there are other reasons that might make a woman avoid a man&rsquo;s
      presence. For instance, if he has displeased her; if the advice, given to
      him with rare wisdom and kindness, was not received with proper eagerness
      and gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear monsieur,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I have no such ardor in
      proselytizing that I am angry with those who are not docile to my advice.
      I am, like others, very apt to make mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, madame, in the matter of my marriage your judgment was
      perfectly correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said the countess, eagerly. &ldquo;Has the seizure of the pamphlet,
      coming directly after the failure to obtain the cross, led to a rupture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;my influence in the Thuillier household rests on a
      solid basis; the services I have rendered Mademoiselle Brigitte and her
      brother outweigh these checks, which, after all, are not irreparable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; said the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;when the Comtesse du Bruel takes it into
      her head to seriously obtain that bit of red ribbon, she can do so, in
      spite of all obstacles that are put in her way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The countess received this assertion with a smile, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, only a day or two ago Madame du Bruel told Madame Colleville
      that the unexpected opposition she had met with piqued her, and that she
      meant to go in person to the minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget that since then this seizure has been made by the police;
      it is not usual to decorate a man who is summoned before the court of
      assizes. You seem not to notice that the seizure argues a strong ill-will
      against Monsieur Thuillier, and, I may add, against yourself, monsieur,
      for you are known to be the culprit. You have not, I think, taken all this
      into account. The authorities appear to have acted not wholly from legal
      causes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade looked at the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must own,&rdquo; he said, after that rapid glance, &ldquo;that I have tried in vain
      to find any passage in that pamphlet which could be made a legal pretext
      for the seizure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s servants must have a vivid
      imagination to persuade themselves they were dealing with a seditious
      publication. But that only proves the strength of the underground power
      which is thwarting all your good intentions in favor of Monsieur
      Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;do you know our secret enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; replied the countess, with another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I dare to utter a suspicion, madame?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with some
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, say what you think,&rdquo; replied Madame de Godollo. &ldquo;I shall not blame
      you if you guess right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, our enemies, Thuillier&rsquo;s and mine, are&mdash;a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing that is so,&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;do you know how many lines
      Richelieu required from a man&rsquo;s hand in order to hang him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can imagine, then, that a pamphlet of two hundred pages might afford
      a&mdash;slightly intriguing woman sufficient ground for persecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all, madame, I understand it!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, with animation.
      &ldquo;I believe that woman to be one of the elite of her sex, with as much mind
      and malice as Richelieu! Adorable magician! it is she who has set in
      motion the police and the gendarmes; but, more than that, it is she who
      withholds that cross the ministers were about to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;why struggle against her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I struggle no longer,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. Then, with an assumed air of
      contrition, he added, &ldquo;You must, indeed, <i>hate</i> me, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite as much as you may think,&rdquo; replied the countess; &ldquo;but, after
      all, suppose that I do hate you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! madame,&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, ardently, &ldquo;I should then be the happiest
      of unhappy men; for that hatred would seem to me sweeter and more precious
      than your indifference. But you do not hate me; why should you feel to me
      that most blessed feminine sentiment which Scribe has depicted with such
      delicacy and wit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Godollo did not answer immediately. She lowered her eyelids, and
      the deeper breathing of her bosom gave to her voice when she did speak a
      tremulous tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hatred of a woman!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is a man of your stoicism able to
      perceive it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, madame,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;I do indeed perceive it, but not
      to revolt against it; on the contrary, I bless the harshness that deigns
      to hurt me. Now that I know my beautiful and avowed enemy, I shall not
      despair of touching her heart; for never again will I follow any road but
      the one that she points out to me, never will I march under any banner but
      hers. I shall wait&mdash;for her inspiration, to think; for her will, to
      will; for her commands, to act. In all things I will be her auxiliary,&mdash;more
      than that, her slave; and if she still repulses me with that dainty foot,
      that snowy hand, I will bear it resignedly, asking, in return for such
      obedience one only favor,&mdash;that of kissing the foot that spurns me,
      of bathing with tears the hand that threatens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this long cry of the excited heart, which the joy of triumph wrung
      from a nature so nervous and impressionable as that of the Provencal, he
      had slidden from his chair, and now knelt with one knee on the ground
      beside the countess, in the conventional attitude of the stage, which is,
      however, much more common in real life than people suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, monsieur,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;and be so good as to answer me.&rdquo;
       Then, giving him a questioning look from beneath her beautiful frowning
      brows, she continued: &ldquo;Have you well-weighed the outcome of the words you
      have just uttered? Have you measured the full extent of your pledge, and
      its depth? With your hand on your heart and on your conscience, are you a
      man to fulfil those words? Or are you one of the falsely humble and
      perfidious men who throw themselves at our feet only to make us lose the
      balance of our will and our reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade; &ldquo;never can I react against the fascination you
      have wielded over me from the moment of our first interview! Ah! madame,
      the more I have resisted, the more I have struggled, the more you ought to
      trust in my sincerity and its tardy expression. What I have said, I think;
      that which I think aloud to-day I have thought in my soul since the hour
      when I first had the honor of admittance to you; and the many days I have
      passed in struggling against this allurement have ended in giving me a
      firm and deliberate will, which understands itself, and is not cast down
      by your severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Severity?&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;possibly. But you ought to think of the
      kindness too. Question yourself carefully. We foreign women do not
      understand the careless ease with which a Frenchwoman enters upon a solemn
      engagement. To us, our <i>yes</i> is sacred; our word is a bond. We do and
      we will nothing by halves. The arms of my family bear a motto which seems
      significant under the present circumstances,&mdash;&lsquo;All or Nothing&rsquo;; that
      is saying much, and yet, perhaps, not enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is how I understand my pledge,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;and on leaving
      this room my first step will be to break with that ignoble past which for
      an instant I seemed to hold in the balance against the intoxicating future
      you do not forbid me to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;do it calmly and advisedly; I do not like rash
      conduct; you will not please me by taking open steps. These Thuilliers are
      not really bad at heart; they humiliated you without knowing that they did
      so; their world is not yours. Is that their fault? Loosen the tie between
      you, but do not violently break it. And, above all, reflect. Your
      conversion to my beliefs is of recent date. What man is certain of what
      his heart will say to him to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I am that man. We men of Southern blood do not
      love as you say a Frenchwoman loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the countess, with a charming smile, &ldquo;I thought it was hatred
      we were talking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; cried the barrister, &ldquo;explained and understood as it has
      been, that word is still a thing that hurts me. Tell me rather, not that
      you love me, but that the words you deigned to say to me at our first
      interview were indeed the expression of your thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the countess, dwelling on the word; &ldquo;one of your
      moralists has said: &lsquo;There are persons who say, <i>that is</i> or <i>that
      is not</i>.&rsquo; Do me the favor to count me among such persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she held out her hand to her suitor with a charming gesture of
      modesty and grace. La Peyrade, quite beside himself, darted upon that
      beautiful hand and devoured it with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, child!&rdquo; said the countess, gently freeing her imprisoned fingers;
      &ldquo;adieu now, soon to meet again! Adieu! My headache, I think, has
      disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade picked up his hat, and seemed about to rush from the apartment;
      but at the door he turned and cast upon the handsome creature a look of
      tenderness. The countess made him, with her head, a graceful gesture of
      adieu; then, seeing that la Peyrade was inclined to return to her, she
      raised her forefinger as a warning to control himself and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade turned and left the apartment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. HOW TO SHUT THE DOOR IN PEOPLE&rsquo;S FACES
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the staircase la Peyrade stopped to exhale, if we may so express it,
      the happiness of which his heart was full. The words of the countess, the
      ingenious preparation she had made to put him on the track of her
      sentiments, seemed to him the guarantee of her sincerity, and he left her
      full of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed by that intoxication of happy persons which shows itself in
      their gestures, their looks, their very gait, and sometimes in actions not
      authorized by their common-sense, after pausing a moment, as we have said,
      on the staircase, he ran up a few steps till he could see the door of the
      Thuilliers&rsquo; apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;fame, fortune, happiness have come to me; but, above
      all, I can now give myself the joy of vengeance. After Dutocq and Cerizet,
      I will crush <i>you</i>, vile bourgeois brood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he shook his fist at the innocent door. Then he turned and ran
      out; the popular saying that the earth could not hold him, was true at
      that moment of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, for he could not restrain any longer the tempest that was
      swelling within him, la Peyrade went to see Thuillier in the bitterest and
      most hostile of moods. What was therefore his amazement when, before he
      had time to put himself on guard and stop the demonstration of union and
      oblivion, Thuillier flung himself into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; cried the municipal councillor, as he loosened his clasp, &ldquo;my
      political fortune is made; this morning all the newspapers, without
      exception, have spoken of the seizure of my pamphlet; and you ought to see
      how the opposition sheets have mauled the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, not moved by this enthusiasm; &ldquo;you are a
      topic for them, that&rsquo;s all. But this does not alter the situation; the
      prosecution will be only the more determined to have you condemned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Thuillier, proudly raising his head, &ldquo;I will go to
      prison, like Beranger, like Lamennais, like Armand Carrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow, persecution is charming at a distance; but when you hear
      the big bolts run upon you, you may be sure you won&rsquo;t like it as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Thuillier, &ldquo;prisoners condemned for political offences are
      always allowed to do their time in hospital if they like. Besides, I&rsquo;m not
      yet convicted. You said yourself you expected to get me acquitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but since then I have heard things which make that result very
      doubtful; the same hand that withheld your cross has seized your pamphlet;
      you are being murdered with premeditation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know who that dangerous enemy is,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
      refuse to point him out to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;I only suspect him. This is what
      you get by playing too shrewd a game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing a shrewd game!&rdquo; said Thuillier, with the curiosity of a man who
      is perfectly aware that he has nothing of that kind on his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you made a sort of decoy of Celeste to attract
      young bloods to your salon. All the world has not the forbearance of
      Monsieur Godeschal, who forgave his rejection and generously managed that
      affair about the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself better,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t see what you
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier to understand. Without counting me, how many suitors
      have you had for Mademoiselle Colleville? Godeschal, Minard junior,
      Phellion junior, Olivier Vinet, the substitute judge,&mdash;all men who
      have been sent about their business, as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olivier Vinet, the substitute judge!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, struck with a
      flash of light. &ldquo;Of course; the blow must have come from him. His father,
      they say, has a long arm. But it can&rsquo;t be truly said that we sent him
      about his business,&mdash;to use your expression, which strikes me as
      indecorous,&mdash;for he never came to the house but once, and made no
      offer; neither did Minard junior or Phellion junior, for that matter.
      Godeschal is the only one who risked a direct proposal, and he was refused
      at once, before he dipped his beak in the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always so!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, still looking for a ground of quarrel.
      &ldquo;Straightforward and outspoken persons are always those that sly men boast
      of fooling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;what are you insinuating?
      Didn&rsquo;t you settle everything with Brigitte the other day? You take a
      pretty time to come and talk to me about your love-affairs, when the sword
      of justice is hanging over my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, ironically; &ldquo;so now you are going to make the most
      of your interesting position of accused person! I knew very well how it
      would be; I was certain that as soon as your pamphlet appeared the old cry
      of not getting what you expected out of me would come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! your pamphlet!&rdquo; cried Thuillier. &ldquo;I think you are a fine fellow
      to boast of that when, on the contrary, it has caused the most deplorable
      complications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deplorable? how so? you have just said your political fortune was made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, truly, my dear Theodose,&rdquo; said Thuillier, with feeling, &ldquo;I should
      never have thought that you would choose the hour of adversity to come and
      put your pistol at our throats and make me the object of your sneers and
      innuendoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;now it is the hour of adversity! A minute
      ago you were flinging yourself into my arms as a man to whom some signal
      piece of luck had happened. You ought really to choose decidedly between
      being a man who needs pity and a glorious victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well to be witty,&rdquo; returned Thuillier; &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t
      controvert what I say. I am logical, if I am not brilliant. It is very
      natural that I should console myself by seeing that public opinion decides
      in my favor, and by reading in its organs the most honorable assurances of
      sympathy; but do you suppose I wouldn&rsquo;t rather that things had taken their
      natural course? Besides, when I see myself the object of unworthy
      vengeance on the part of persons as influential as the Vinets, how can I
      help measuring the extent of the dangers to which I am exposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with pitiless persistency, &ldquo;I see that you prefer
      to play the part of Jeremiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thuillier, in a solemn tone. &ldquo;Jeremiah laments over a
      friendship I did think true and devoted, but which I find has only
      sarcasms to give me when I looked for services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What services?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade. &ldquo;Did you not tell me positively, no
      later than yesterday, that you would not accept my help under any form
      whatever? I offered to plead your case, and you answered that you would
      take a better lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in the first shock of surprise at such an unexpected blow, I did say
      that foolish thing; but, on reflection, who can explain as well as you can
      the intention of the words you wrote with your own pen? Yesterday I was
      almost out of my mind; but you, with your wounded self-love, which can&rsquo;t
      forgive a momentary impatience, you are very caustic and cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you formally request me to defend you before the
      jury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear fellow; and I don&rsquo;t know any other hands in which I could
      better place my case. I should have to pay a monstrous sum to some great
      legal luminary, and he wouldn&rsquo;t defend me as ably as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I refuse. Roles have changed, as you see, diametrically. Yesterday,
      I thought, as you do, that I was the man to defend you. To-day, I see that
      you had better take the legal luminary, because, with Vinet&rsquo;s antagonism
      against you the affair is taking such proportions that whoever defends it
      assumes a fearful responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Thuillier, sarcastically. &ldquo;Monsieur has his eye on
      the magistracy, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to quarrel with a man who is already
      talked of for Keeper of the Seals. It is prudent, but I don&rsquo;t know that it
      is going to help on your marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, seizing the ball in its bound, &ldquo;that to get
      you out of the claws of that jury is a thirteenth labor of Hercules,
      imposed upon me to earn the hand of Mademoiselle Colleville? I expected
      that demands would multiply in proportion to the proofs of my devotion.
      But that is the very thing that has worn me out, and I have come here
      to-day to put an end to this slave labor by giving back to you your
      pledges. You may dispose of Celeste&rsquo;s hand; for my part, I am no longer a
      suitor for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpectedness and squareness of this declaration left Thuillier
      without words or voice, all the more because at this moment entered
      Brigitte. The temper of the old maid had also greatly moderated since the
      previous evening, and her greeting was full of the most amicable
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so here you are, you good old barrister,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, your servant,&rdquo; he replied, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, paying no attention to the stiffness of his manner,
      &ldquo;the government has got itself into a pretty mess by seizing your
      pamphlet. You ought to see how the morning papers lash it! Here,&rdquo; she
      added, giving Thuillier a small sheet printed on sugar-paper, in coarse
      type, and almost illegible,&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s another, you didn&rsquo;t read; the
      porter has just brought it up. It is a paper from our old quarter, &lsquo;L&rsquo;Echo
      de la Bievre.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know, gentlemen, if you&rsquo;ll be of my opinion, but I
      think nothing could be better written. It is droll, though, how
      inattentive these journalists are! most of them write your name without
      the H; I think you ought to complain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier took the paper, and read the article inspired to the reviewer of
      the tanner&rsquo;s organ by stomach gratitude. Never in her life had Brigitte
      paid the slightest attention to a newspaper, except to know if it was the
      right size for the packages she wrapped up in it; but now, suddenly,
      converted to a worship of the press by the ardor of her sisterly love, she
      stood behind Thuillier and re-read, over his shoulder, the more striking
      passages of the page she thought so eloquent, pointing her finger to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thuillier, folding up the paper, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s warm, and very
      flattering to me. But here&rsquo;s another matter! Monsieur has come to tell me
      that he refuses to plead for me, and renounces all claim to Celeste&rsquo;s
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;he renounces her if, after having
      pleaded, the marriage does not take place &lsquo;subito.&rsquo; Well, poor fellow, I
      think that&rsquo;s a reasonable demand. When he has done that for us there ought
      to be no further delay; and whether Mademoiselle Celeste likes it or not,
      she must accept him, because, you know, there&rsquo;s an end to all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that, my good fellow?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, seizing upon
      Brigitte&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;When I have pleaded, the marriage is to take place.
      Your sister is frankness itself; she, at least, doesn&rsquo;t practise
      diplomacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diplomacy!&rdquo; echoed Brigitte. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see myself creeping underground
      in matters. I say things as I think them. The workman has worked, and he
      ought to have his pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be silent,&rdquo; cried Thuillier, stamping his foot; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say a word
      that doesn&rsquo;t turn the knife in the wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knife in the wound?&rdquo; said Brigitte, inquiringly. &ldquo;Ah ca! are you two
      quarrelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;that la Peyrade had returned our promises;
      and the reason he gives is that we are asking him another service for
      Celeste&rsquo;s hand. He thinks he has done us enough without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done us some services, no doubt,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;but it seems to
      me that we have not been ungrateful to him. Besides, it was he who made
      the blunder, and I think it rather odd he should now wish to leave us in
      the lurch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reasoning, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;might have some
      appearance of justice if I were the only barrister in Paris; but as the
      streets are black with them, and as, only yesterday, Thuillier himself
      spoke of engaging some more important lawyer than myself, I have not the
      slightest scruple in refusing to defend him. Now, as to the marriage, in
      order that it may not be made the object of another brutal and forcible
      demand upon me, I here renounce it in the most formal manner, and nothing
      now prevents Mademoiselle Colleville from accepting Monsieur Felix
      Phellion and all his advantages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my dear monsieur,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s your last
      word. We shall not be at a loss to find a husband for Celeste,&mdash;Felix
      Phellion or another. But you must permit me to tell you that the reason
      you give is not the true one. We can&rsquo;t go faster than the fiddles. If the
      marriage were settled to-day, there are the banns to publish; you have
      sense enough to know that Monsieur le maire can&rsquo;t marry you before the
      formalities are complied with, and before then Thuillier&rsquo;s case will have
      been tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;and if I lose the case it will be I who have sent
      him to prison,&mdash;just as yesterday it was I who brought about the
      seizure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, it seems to me that if you had written nothing the police
      would have found nothing to bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Brigitte,&rdquo; said Thuillier, seeing la Peyrade shrug his shoulders,
      &ldquo;your argument is vicious in the sense that the writing was not
      incriminating on any side. It is not la Peyrade&rsquo;s fault if persons of high
      station have organized a persecution against me. You remember that little
      substitute, Monsieur Olivier Vinet, whom Cardot brought to one of our
      receptions. It seems that he and his father are furious that we didn&rsquo;t
      want him for Celeste, and they&rsquo;ve sworn my destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why did we refuse him,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fine
      eyes of monsieur here? For, after all, a substitute in Paris is a very
      suitable match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, nonchalantly. &ldquo;Only, he did not happen to
      bring you a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, firing up. &ldquo;If you are going to talk any more about
      that house you helped us to buy, I shall tell you plainly that if you had
      had the money to trick the notary you never would have come after us. You
      needn&rsquo;t think I have been altogether your dupe. You spoke just now of a
      bargain, but you proposed that bargain yourself. &lsquo;Give me Celeste and I&rsquo;ll
      get you that house,&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you said to us in so many words.
      Besides which, we had to pay large sums on which we never counted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Brigitte,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;you are making a great deal out
      of nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Brigitte. &ldquo;Did we, or did we not, have to
      pay much more than we expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Thuillier,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I think, with you, that the matter
      is now settled, and it can only be embittered by discussing it further. My
      course was decided on before I came here; all that I have now heard can
      only confirm it. I shall not be the husband of Celeste, but you and I can
      remain good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, monsieur,&rdquo; said Brigitte, barring his way; &ldquo;there is one
      matter which I do not consider settled; and now that we are no longer to
      have interests in common, I should not be sorry if you would be so good as
      to tell me what has become of a sum of ten thousand francs which Thuillier
      gave you to bribe those rascally government offices in order to get the
      cross we have never got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brigitte!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, in anguish, &ldquo;you have a devil of a tongue!
      You ought to be silent about that; I told it to you in a moment of
      ill-temper, and you promised me faithfully never to open your lips about
      it to any one, no matter who.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did; but,&rdquo; replied the implacable Brigitte, &ldquo;we are parting. When
      people part they settle up; they pay their debts. Ten thousand francs! For
      my part, I thought the cross itself dear at that; but for a cross that has
      melted away, monsieur himself will allow the price is too high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, la Peyrade, my friend, don&rsquo;t listen to her,&rdquo; said Thuillier, going
      up to the barrister, who was pale with anger. &ldquo;The affection she has for
      me blinds her; I know very well what government offices are, and I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you had had to pay out money of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I am, unfortunately, not in a position to
      return to you, instantly, that money, an accounting for which is so
      insolently demanded. Grant me a short delay; and have the goodness to
      accept my note, which I am ready to sign, if that will give you patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with your note!&rdquo; cried Thuillier; &ldquo;you owe me nothing; on
      the contrary, it is we who owe you; for Cardot told me I ought to give you
      at least ten thousand francs for enabling us to buy this magnificent
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardot! Cardot!&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;he is very generous with other people&rsquo;s
      money. We were giving monsieur Celeste, and that&rsquo;s a good deal more than
      ten thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was too great a comedian not to turn the humiliation he had
      just endured into a scene finale. With tears in his voice, which presently
      fell from his eyes, he turned to Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I had the honor to be received by you I was
      poor; you long saw me suffering and ill at ease, knowing, alas! too well,
      the indignities that poverty must bear. From the day that I was able to
      give you a fortune which I never thought of for myself I have felt, it is
      true, more assurance; and your own kindness encouraged me to rise out of
      my timidity and depression. To-day, when I, by frank and loyal conduct,
      release you from anxiety,&mdash;for, if you chose to be honest, you would
      acknowledge that you have been thinking of another husband for Celeste,&mdash;we
      might still remain friends, even though I renounce a marriage which my
      delicacy forbids me to pursue. But you have not chosen to restrain
      yourself with the limits of social politeness, of which you have a model
      beside you in Madame de Godollo, who, I am persuaded, although she is not
      at all friendly to me, would never have approved of your odious behavior.
      Thank Heaven! I have in my heart some religious sentiment at least; the
      Gospel is not to me a mere dead-letter, and&mdash;understand me well,
      mademoiselle&mdash;<i>I forgive you</i>. It is not to Thuillier, who would
      refuse them, but to you that I shall, before long, pay the ten thousand
      francs which you insinuate I have applied to my own purposes. If, by the
      time they are returned to you, you feel regret for your unjust suspicions,
      and are unwilling to accept the money, I request that you will turn it
      over to the bureau of Benevolence to the poor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the bureau of Benevolence!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, interrupting him. &ldquo;No, I
      thank you! the idea of all that money being distributed among a crowd of
      do-nothings and devotes, who&rsquo;ll spend it in junketing! I&rsquo;ve been poor too,
      my lad; I made bags for the money of others long before I had any money of
      my own; I have some now, and I take care of it. So, whenever you will, I
      am ready to receive that ten thousand francs and keep it. If you didn&rsquo;t
      know how to do what you undertook to do, and spent that money in trying to
      put salt on a sparrow&rsquo;s tail, so much the worse for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he had missed his effect, and had made not the slightest
      impression on Brigitte&rsquo;s granite, la Peyrade cast a disdainful look upon
      her and left the room majestically. As he did so he noticed a movement
      made by Thuillier to follow him, and also the imperious gesture of
      Brigitte, always queen and mistress, which nailed her brother to his
      chair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the moment when la Peyrade was preparing to lay at the feet of the
      countess the liberty he had recovered in so brutal a manner, he received a
      perfumed note, which made his heart beat, for on the seal was that
      momentous &ldquo;All or Nothing&rdquo; which she had given him as the rule of the
      relation now to be inaugurated between them. The contents of the note were
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dear Monsieur,&mdash;I have heard of the step you have taken; thank
  you! But I must now prepare to take my own. I cannot, as you may
  well think, continue to live in this house, and among these people
  who are so little of our own class and with whom we have nothing
  in common. To arrange this transaction, and to avoid explanations
  of the fact that the entresol welcomes the voluntary exile from
  the first-floor, I need to-day and to-morrow to myself. Do not
  therefore come to see me until the day after. By that time I shall
  have executed Brigitte, as they say at the Bourse, and have much
  to tell you.
</pre>
    <p>
      Tua tota,
    </p>
    <p>
      Torna de Godollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Wholly thine&rdquo; in Latin seemed charming to la Peyrade, who was not,
      however, astonished, for Latin is a second national language to the
      Hungarians. The two days&rsquo; waiting to which he was thus condemned only
      fanned the flame of the ardent passion which possessed him, and on the
      third day when reached the house by the Madeleine his love had risen to a
      degree of incandescence of which only a few days earlier he would scarcely
      have supposed himself capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the porter&rsquo;s wife perceived him; but he was now quite
      indifferent as to whether or not the object of his visit should be known.
      The ice was broken, his happiness was soon to be official, and he was more
      disposed to cry it aloud in the streets than to make a mystery of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running lightly up the stairs, he prepared to ring the bell, when, on
      putting out his hand to reach the silken bell-cord he perceived that the
      bell-cord had disappeared. La Peyrade&rsquo;s first thought was that one of
      those serious illnesses which make all noises intolerable to a patient
      would explain its absence; but with the thought came other observations
      that weakened it, and which, moreover, were not in themselves comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the vestibule to the countess&rsquo;s door a stair carpet, held at each
      step by a brass rod, made a soft ascent to the feet of visitors; this,
      too, had been removed. A screen-door covered with green velvet and studded
      with brass nails had hitherto protected the entrance to the apartment; of
      that no sign, except the injury to the wall done by the workmen in taking
      it away. For a moment the barrister thought, in his agitation, that he
      must have mistaken the floor, but, casting his eye over the baluster he
      saw that he had not passed the entresol. Madame de Godollo must,
      therefore, be in the act of moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then resigned himself to make known his presence at the great lady&rsquo;s
      door as he would have done at that of a grisette. He rapped with his
      knuckles, but a hollow sonority revealing the void, &ldquo;intonuere cavernae,&rdquo;
       echoed beyond the door which he vainly appealed to with his fist. He also
      perceived from beneath that door a ray of vivid light, the sure sign of an
      uninhabited apartment where curtains and carpets and furniture no longer
      dim the light or deaden sound. Compelled to believe in a total removal, la
      Peyrade now supposed that in the rupture with Brigitte, mentioned as
      probable by Madame de Godollo, some brutal insolence of the old maid had
      necessitated this abrupt departure. But why had he not been told of it?
      And what an idea, to expose him to this ridiculous meeting with what the
      common people call, in their picturesque language, &ldquo;the wooden face&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving the door finally, and as if some doubt still remained in
      his mind, la Peyrade made a last and most thundering assault upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s knocking like that, as if they&rsquo;d bring the house down?&rdquo; said the
      porter, attracted by the noise to the foot of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Madame de Godollo still live here?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she doesn&rsquo;t live here now; she has moved away. If monsieur had
      told me he was going to her apartment I would have spared him the trouble
      of battering down the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that she was going to leave the apartment,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, not
      wishing to seem ignorant of the project of departure, &ldquo;but I had no idea
      she was going so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was something sudden,&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;for she went off
      early this morning with post-horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post-horses!&rdquo; echoed la Peyrade, stupefied. &ldquo;Then she has left Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be supposed,&rdquo; said the porter; &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t usually take
      post-horses and a postilion to change from one quarter of Paris to
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she did not tell you where she was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, what an idea! Do people account to us porters for what they
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but her letters&mdash;those that come after her departure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her letters? I am ordered to deliver them to Monsieur le commandeur, the
      little old gentlemen who came to see her so often; monsieur must have met
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, certainly,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, keeping his presence of mind in
      the midst of the successive shocks which came upon him,&mdash;&ldquo;the powered
      little man who was here every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say every day; but he came often. Well, I am told to give the
      countess&rsquo;s letters to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for other persons of her acquaintance,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, carelessly,
      &ldquo;did she leave no message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;good-morning.&rdquo; And he turned to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think,&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;that Mademoiselle Thuillier knows more
      about it than I do. Won&rsquo;t monsieur go up? She is at home; and so is
      Monsieur Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never mind,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I only came to tell Madame de Godollo
      about a commission she asked me to execute; I haven&rsquo;t time to stop now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I told you, she left with post-horses this morning. Two hours
      earlier monsieur might still have found her; but now, with post-horses,
      she must by this time have gone a good distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade departed, with a sense of despair in his heart. Added to the
      anxiety caused by this hasty departure, jealousy entered his soul, and in
      this agonizing moment of disappointment the most distressing explanations
      crowded on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after further reflection, he said to himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These clever diplomatic women are often sent on secret missions which
      require the most absolute silence, and extreme rapidity of movement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here a sudden revulsion of thought overcame him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose she were one of those intriguing adventurers whom foreign
      governments employ as agents? Suppose the tale, more or less probable, of
      that Russian princess forced to sell her furniture to Brigitte were also
      that of this Hungarian countess? And yet,&rdquo; he continued, as his brain made
      a third evolution in this frightful anarchy of ideas and feelings, &ldquo;her
      education, her manners, her language, all bespoke a woman of the best
      position. Besides, if she were only a bird of passage, why have given
      herself so much trouble to win me over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade might have continued to plead thus for and against for a long
      time had he not been suddenly grasped round the shoulders by a strong arm
      and addressed in a well-known voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! my dear barrister; a frightful danger threatens you; you are
      running right into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade, thus arrested, looked round and found himself in the arms of
      Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene took place in front of a house which was being pulled down at
      the corner of the rues Duphot and Saint-Honore. Posted on the pavement of
      the other side of the street, Phellion, whose taste for watching the
      process of building our readers may remember, had been witnessing for the
      last fifteen minutes the drama of a wall about to fall beneath the united
      efforts of a squadron of workmen. Watch in hand, the great citizen was
      estimating the length of the resistance which that mass of freestone would
      present to the destructive labor of which it was the object. Precisely at
      the crucial moment of the impending catastrophe la Peyrade, lost in the
      tumult of his thoughts, was entering, heedless of the shouts addressed to
      him on all sides, the radius within which the stones would fall. Seen by
      Phellion (who, it must be said, would have done the same for a total
      stranger) la Peyrade undoubtedly owed his life to him; for, at the moment
      when he was violently flung back by the vigorous grasp of the worthy
      citizen, the wall fell with the noise of a cannon-shot, and the stones
      rolled in clouds of dust almost to his very feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you blind and deaf?&rdquo; said the workman whose business it was to warn
      the passers, in a tone of amenity it is easy to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear friend,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, recalled to earth. &ldquo;I should
      certainly have been crushed like an idiot if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pressed Phellion&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reward,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;lies in the satisfaction of knowing that
      you are saved from an imminent peril. And I may say that that satisfaction
      is mingled, for me, with a certain pride; for I was not mistaken by a
      single second in the calculation which enabled me to foresee the exact
      moment when that formidable mass would be displaced from its centre of
      gravity. But what were you thinking of, my dear monsieur? Probably of the
      plea you are about to make in the Thuillier affair. The public prints have
      informed me of the danger of prosecution by the authorities which hangs
      above the head of our estimable friend. You have a noble cause to defend,
      monsieur. Habituated as I am, through my labors as a member of the reading
      committee of the Odeon, to judge of works of intellect, and with my hand
      upon my conscience, I declare that after reading the incriminated
      passages, I can find nothing in the tone of that pamphlet which justifies
      the severe measures of which it is the object. Between ourselves,&rdquo; added
      the great citizen, lowering his voice, &ldquo;I think the government has shown
      itself petty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I think,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;but I am not employed for the defence. I
      have advised Thuillier to engage some noted lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be good advice,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;at any rate, it speaks well for
      your modesty. Poor man! I went to him at once when the blow fell, but I
      did not see him; I saw only Brigitte, who was having a discussion with
      Madame de Godollo. There is a woman with strong political views; it seems
      she predicted that the seizure would be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know that the countess had left Paris?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, rushing
      at the chance of speaking on the subject of his present monomania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! left Paris, has she?&rdquo; said Phellion. &ldquo;Well, monsieur, I must tell you
      that, although there was not much sympathy between us, I regard her
      departure as a misfortune. She will leave a serious void in the salon of
      our friends. I say this, because it is my belief, and I am not in the
      habit of disguising my convictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;she is certainly a very distinguished woman, with
      whom in spite of her prejudice against me, I think I should have come to
      an understanding. But this morning, without leaving any word as to where
      she was going, she started suddenly with post-horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post-horses!&rdquo; said Phellion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you will agree with
      me, monsieur, but I think that travelling by post is a most agreeable
      method of conveyance. Certainly Louis XI., to whom we owe the institution,
      had a fortunate inspiration in the matter; although, on the other hand,
      his sanguinary and despotic government was not, to my humble thinking,
      entirely devoid of reproach. Once only in my life have I used that method
      of locomotion, and I can truly say I found it far superior, in spite of
      its inferior relative rapidity, to the headlong course of what in England
      are called <i>railways</i>; where speed is attained only at the price of
      safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade paid but little attention to Phellion&rsquo;s phraseology. &ldquo;Where can
      she have gone?&rdquo;&mdash;round that idea he dug and delved in every
      direction, an occupation that would have made him indifferent to a far
      more interesting topic. However, once started, like the locomotive he
      objected to, the great citizen went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made that journey at the period of Madame Phellion&rsquo;s last confinement.
      She was in Perche, with her mother, when I learned that serious
      complications were feared from the milk-fever. Overcome with terror at the
      danger which threatened my wife, I went instantly to the post-office to
      obtain a seat in the mail-coach, but all were taken; I found they had been
      engaged for more than a week. Upon that, I came to a decision; I went to
      the rue Pigalle, and, for a very large sum in gold a post-chaise and three
      horses were placed at my disposal, when unfortunately the formality of a
      passport, with which I had neglected to supply myself, and without which,
      in virtue of the decrees of the consulate of 17 Nivose, year VII., the
      post agents were not permitted to deliver horses to travellers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last few words were like a flash of light to la Peyrade, and without
      waiting for the end of the postal odyssey of the great citizen, he darted
      away in the direction of the rue Pigalle, before Phellion, in the middle
      of his sentence, perceived his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the Royal postal establishment, la Peyrade was puzzled as to whom
      to address himself in order to obtain the information he wanted. He began
      by explaining to the porter that he had a letter to send to a lady of his
      acquaintance that morning by post, neglecting, very thoughtlessly, to send
      him her address, and that he thought he might discover it by means of the
      passport which she must have presented in order to obtain horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a lady accompanied by a maid whom I took up on the boulevard de la
      Madeleine?&rdquo; asked a postilion sitting in the corner of the room where la
      Peyrade was making his preliminary inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, going eagerly up to the providential being,
      and slipping a five-franc piece into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, she&rsquo;s a queer traveller!&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;she told me to take
      her to the Bois de Boulogne, and there she made me drive round and round
      for an hour. After that, we came back to the Barriere de l&rsquo;Etoile, where
      she gave me a good &lsquo;pourboire&rsquo; and got into a hackney coach, telling me to
      take the travelling carriage back to the man who lets such carriages in
      the Cour des Coches, Faubourg Saint-Honore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the name of that man?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simonin,&rdquo; replied the postilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furnished with that information la Peyrade resumed his course, and fifteen
      minutes later he was questioning the livery-stable keeper; but that
      individual knew only that a lady residing on the Boulevard de la Madeleine
      had hired, without horses, a travelling-carriage for half a day; that he
      had sent out the said carriage at nine that morning, and it was brought
      back at twelve by a postilion of the Royal Post house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; thought la Peyrade, &ldquo;I am certain now she has not left
      Paris, and is not avoiding me. Most probably, she wants to break utterly
      with the Thuilliers, and so has invented this journey. Fool that I am! no
      doubt there&rsquo;s a letter waiting for me at home, explaining the whole
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Worn out with emotion and fatigue, and in order to verify as quickly as
      possible this new supposition, la Peyrade flung himself into a street cab,
      and in less than a quarter of an hour, having promised the driver a good
      pourboire, he was deposited at the house in the rue Saint-Dominique
      d&rsquo;Enfer. There he was compelled to endure still longer the tortures of
      waiting. Since Brigitte&rsquo;s departure, the duty of the porter, Coffinet, had
      been very negligently performed, and when la Peyrade rushed to the lodge
      to inquire for his letter, which he thought he saw in the case that
      belonged to him, the porter and his wife were both absent and their door
      was locked. The wife was doing some household work in the building, and
      Coffinet himself, taking advantage of that circumstance, had allowed a
      friend to entice him into a neighboring wine-shop, where, between two
      glasses, he was supporting, against a republican who was talking
      disrespectfully against it, the cause of the owners of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was twenty minutes before the worthy porter, remembering the &ldquo;property&rdquo;
       entrusted to his charge, decided to return to his post. It is easy to
      imagine the reproaches with which la Peyrade overwhelmed him. He excused
      himself by saying that he had gone to do a commission for Mademoiselle,
      and that he couldn&rsquo;t be at the door and where his masters chose to send
      him at the same time. At last, however, he gave the lawyer a letter
      bearing the Paris postmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his heart rather than his eyes la Peyrade recognized the handwriting,
      and, turning over the missive, the arms and motto confirmed the hope that
      he had reached the end of the cruellest emotion he had ever in his life
      experienced. To read that letter before that odious porter seemed to him a
      profanation. With a refinement of feeling which all lovers will
      understand, he gave himself the pleasure of pausing before his happiness;
      he would not even unseal that blissful note until the moment when, with
      closed doors and no interruptions to distract him, he could enjoy at his
      ease the delicious sensation of which his heart had a foretaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rushing up the staircase two steps at a time, the now joyous lover
      committed the childish absurdity of locking himself in; then, having
      settled himself at his ease before his desk, and having broken the seal
      with religious care, he was forced to press his hand on his heart, which
      seemed to burst from his bosom, before he could summon calmness to read
      the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dear Monsieur,&mdash;I disappear forever, because my play is played
  out. I thank you for having made it both attractive and easy. By
  setting against you the Thuilliers and Collevilles (who are fully
  informed of your sentiments towards them), and by relating in a
  manner most mortifying to their bourgeois self-love the true
  reason of your sudden and pitiless rupture with them, I am proud
  and happy to believe that I have done you a signal service. The
  girl does not love you, and you love nothing but the eyes of her
  &ldquo;dot&rdquo;; I have therefore saved you both from a species of hell.
  But, in exchange for the bride you have so curtly rejected,
  another charming girl is proposed to you; she is richer and more
  beautiful than Mademoiselle Colleville, and&mdash;to speak of myself
  &mdash;more at liberty than

  Your unworthy servant,

  Torna &ldquo;Comtesse de Godollo.&rdquo;
 
  P.S. For further information apply, without delay, to Monsieur du
  Portail, householder, rue Honore-Chevalier, near the rue de la
  Cassette, quartier Saint-Sulpice, by whom you are expected.
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had read this letter the advocate of the poor took his head in his
      hands; he saw nothing, heard nothing, thought nothing; he was annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days were necessary to la Peyrade before he could even begin to
      recover from the crushing blow which had struck him down. The shock was
      terrible. Coming out of that golden dream which had shown him a
      perspective of the future in so smiling an aspect, he found himself fooled
      under conditions most cruel to his self-love, and to his pretensions to
      depth and cleverness; irrevocably parted from the Thuilliers; saddled with
      a hopeless debt of twenty-five thousand francs to Madame Lambert, together
      with another of ten thousand to Brigitte, which his dignity required him
      to pay with the least delay possible; and, worst of all,&mdash;to complete
      his humiliation and his sense of failure,&mdash;he felt that he was not
      cured of the passionate emotion he had felt for this woman, the author of
      his great disaster, and the instrument of his ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either this Delilah was a very great lady, sufficiently high in station to
      allow herself such compromising caprices,&mdash;but even so, she would
      scarcely have cared to play the role of a coquette in a vaudeville where
      he himself played the part of ninny,&mdash;<i>or</i> she was some noted
      adventuress who was in the pay of this du Portail and the agent of his
      singular matrimonial designs. Evil life or evil heart, these were the only
      two verdicts to be pronounced on this dangerous siren, and in either case,
      it would seem, she was not very deserving of the regrets of her victim;
      nevertheless, he was conscious of feeling them. We must put ourselves in
      the place of this son of Provence, this region of hot blood and ardent
      heads, who, for the first time in his life finding himself face to face
      with jewelled love in laces, believed he was to drink that passion from a
      wrought-gold cup. Just as our minds on waking keep the impression of a
      vivid dream and continue in love with what we know was but a shadow, la
      Peyrade had need of all his mental energy to drive away the memory of that
      treacherous countess. We might go further and say that he never ceased to
      long for her, though he was careful to drape with an honest pretext the
      intense desire that he had to find her. That desire he called curiosity,
      ardor for revenge; and here follow the ingenious deductions which he drew
      for himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet talked to me about a rich heiress; the countess, in her letter,
      intimates that the whole intrigue she wound about me was to lead to a rich
      marriage; rich marriages flung at a man&rsquo;s head are not so plentiful that
      two such chances should come to me within a few weeks; therefore the match
      offered by Cerizet and that proposed by the countess must be the crazy
      girl they are so frantic to make me marry; therefore Cerizet, being in the
      plot, must know the countess; therefore, through him I shall get upon her
      traces. In any case, I am sure of information about this extraordinary
      choice that has fallen upon me; evidently, these people, whoever they are,
      who can pull the wires of such puppets to reach their ends must be persons
      of considerable position; therefore, I&rsquo;ll go and see Cerizet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went to see Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the dinner at the Rocher de Cancale, the pair had not met. Once or
      twice la Peyrade had asked Dutocq at the Thuilliers&rsquo; (where the latter
      seldom went now, on account of the distance to their new abode) what had
      become of his copying clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never speaks of you,&rdquo; Dutocq had answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it might be inferred that resentment, the &ldquo;manet alta mente
      repostum&rdquo; was still living in the breast of the vindictive usurer. La
      Peyrade, however, was not stopped by that consideration. After all, he was
      not going to ask for anything; he went under the pretext of renewing an
      affair in which Cerizet had taken part, and Cerizet never took part in
      anything unless he had a personal interest in it. The chances were,
      therefore, that he would be received with affectionate eagerness rather
      than unpleasant acerbity. Moreover, he decided to go and see the copying
      clerk at Dutocq&rsquo;s office; it would look, he thought, less like a visit
      than if he went to his den in the rue des Poules. It was nearly two
      o&rsquo;clock when la Peyrade made his entrance into the precincts of the
      justice-of-peace of the 12th arrondissement. He crossed the first room, in
      which were a crowd of persons whom civil suits of one kind or another
      summoned before the magistrate. Without pausing in that waiting-room, la
      Peyrade pushed on to the office adjoining that of Dutocq. There he found
      Cerizet at a shabby desk of blackened wood, at which another clerk, then
      absent, occupied the opposite seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his visitor, Cerizet cast a savage look at him and said, without
      rising, or suspending the copy of the judgment he was then engrossing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, Sieur la Peyrade? You have been doing fine things for your
      friend Thuillier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, in a tone both resolute and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;As you see, still rowing my galley; and, to follow
      out the nautical metaphor, allow me to ask what wind has blown you hither;
      is it, perchance, the wind of adversity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade, without replying, took a chair beside his questioner, after
      which he said in a grave tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, we have something to say to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Cerizet, spitefully, &ldquo;the Thuilliers have grown cold
      since the seizure of the pamphlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Thuilliers are ungrateful people; I have broken with them,&rdquo; replied
      la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupture or dismissal,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;their door is shut against you; and
      from what Dutocq tells me, I judge that Brigitte is handling you without
      gloves. You see, my friend, what it is to try and manage affairs alone;
      complications come, and there&rsquo;s no one to smooth the angles. If you had
      got me that lease, I should have had a footing at the Thuilliers&rsquo;, Dutocq
      would not have abandoned you, and together we could have brought you
      gently into port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I don&rsquo;t want to re-enter that port?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with
      some sharpness. &ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve had enough of those Thuilliers, and I
      broke with them myself; I warned them to get out of my sun; and if Dutocq
      told you anything else you may tell him from me that he lies. Is that
      clear enough? It seems to me I&rsquo;ve made it plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, exactly, my good fellow, if you are so savage against your
      Thuilliers you ought to have put me among them, and then you&rsquo;d have seen
      me avenge you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;I wish I could have set you at
      their legs&mdash;but as for that matter of the lease I tell you again, I
      was not master of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;it was your conscience which obliged you to
      tell Brigitte that the twelve thousand francs a year I expected to make
      out of it were better in her pocket than in mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that Dutocq continues the honorable profession of spy which he
      formerly practised at the ministry of finance,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;and,
      like others who do that dirty business, he makes his reports more witty
      than truthful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;you are talking of my patron in his own lair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;I have come to talk to you on serious
      matters. Will you do me the favor to drop the Thuilliers and all their
      belongings, and give me your attention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say on, my friend,&rdquo; said Cerizet, laying down his pen, which had never
      ceased to run, up to this moment, &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talked to me some time ago,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;about marrying a girl
      who was rich, fully of age, and slightly hysterical, as you were pleased
      to put it euphemistically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried Cerizet. &ldquo;I expected this; but you&rsquo;ve been some time
      coming to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In offering me this heiress, what did you have in your mind?&rdquo; asked la
      Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! to help you to a splendid stroke of business. You had only to
      stoop and take it. I was formally charged to propose it to you; and, as
      there wasn&rsquo;t any brokerage, I should have relied wholly on your
      generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not the only person who was commissioned to make me that
      offer. A woman had the same order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; cried Cerizet in a perfectly natural tone of surprise. &ldquo;Not
      that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a foreigner, young and pretty, whom you must have met in the family
      of the bride, to whom she seems to be ardently devoted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;never has there been the slightest question of a
      woman in this negotiation. I have every reason to believe that I am
      exclusively charged with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, fixing upon Cerizet a scrutinizing eye, &ldquo;did you
      never hear of the Comtesse Torna de Godollo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, in all my life; this is the first time I ever heard that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;it must really have been another match; for that
      woman, after many singular preliminaries, too long to explain to you, made
      me a formal offer of the hand of a young woman much richer than
      Mademoiselle Colleville&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hysterical?&rdquo; asked Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she did not embellish the proposal with that accessory; but there&rsquo;s
      another detail which may put you on the track of her. Madame de Godollo
      exhorted me, if I wished to push the matter, to go and see a certain
      Monsieur du Portail&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue Honore-Chevalier?&rdquo; exclaimed Cerizet, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is the same marriage which is offered to you through two
      different mediums. It is strange I was not informed of this
      collaboration!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you not only didn&rsquo;t have wind of the
      countess&rsquo;s intervention, but you don&rsquo;t know her, and you can&rsquo;t give me any
      information about her&mdash;is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll find out about her; for
      the whole proceeding is rather cavalier towards me; but this employment of
      two agents only shows you how desirable you are to the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door of the room was opened cautiously, a woman&rsquo;s head
      appeared, and a voice, which was instantly recognized by la Peyrade, said,
      addressing the copying-clerk:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! excuse me! I see monsieur is busy. Could I say a word to monsieur
      when he is alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet, who had an eye as nimble as a hand, instantly noticed a certain
      fact. La Peyrade, who was so placed as to be plainly seen by the
      new-comer, no sooner heard that drawling, honeyed voice, than he turned
      his head in a manner to conceal his features. Instead therefore of being
      roughly sent away, as usually happened to petitioners who addressed the
      most surly of official clerks, the modest visitor heard herself greeted in
      a very surprising manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in, Madame Lambert,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be kept
      waiting long; come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor advanced, and then came face to face with la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur!&rdquo; cried his creditor, whom the reader has no doubt
      recognized, &ldquo;how fortunate I am to meet monsieur! I have been several
      times to his office to ask if he had had time to attend to my little
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had many engagements which have kept me away from my office
      lately; but I attended to that matter; everything has been done right, and
      is now in the hands of the secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how good monsieur is! I pray God to bless him,&rdquo; said the pious woman,
      clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! do you have business with Madame Lambert?&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;you
      never told me that. Are you Pere Picot&rsquo;s counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unfortunately,&rdquo; said Madame Lambert, &ldquo;my master won&rsquo;t take any
      counsel; he is so self-willed, so obstinate! But, my good monsieur, what I
      came to ask is whether the family council is to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;and not later than to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But monsieur, I hear those gentlemen of the Royal court said the family
      had no rights&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;the lower court and the Royal court
      have both, on the petition of the relatives, rejected their demand for a
      commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;to think of making him out a lunatic!
      him so full of wisdom and learning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the relations don&rsquo;t mean to give up; they are going to try the matter
      again under a new form, and ask for the appointment of a judicial counsel.
      That&rsquo;s what the family council meets for to-morrow; and I think, this
      time, my dear Madame Lambert, your old Picot will find himself restrained.
      There are serious allegations, I can tell you. It was all very well to
      take the eggs, but to pluck the hen was another thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that monsieur can suppose&mdash;&rdquo; began the devote,
      clasping her hands under her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose nothing,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;I am not the judge of this affair. But
      the relations declare that you have pocketed considerable sums, and made
      investments about which they demand inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! heavens!&rdquo; said the woman, casting up her eyes; &ldquo;they can inquire; I
      am poor; I have not a deed, nor a note, nor a share; not the slightest
      security of any kind in my possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said Cerizet, glancing at la Peyrade out of the corner
      of his eye; &ldquo;but there are always friends to take care of such things.
      However, that is none of my business; every one must settle his own
      affairs in his own way. Now, then, say what you have to say, distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came, monsieur,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;to implore you, monsieur, to implore
      Monsieur the judge&rsquo;s clerk, to speak in our favor to Monsieur the
      justice-of-peace. Monsieur the vicar of Saint-Jacques is also to speak to
      him. That poor Monsieur Picot!&rdquo; she went on, weeping, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll kill him if
      they continue to worry him in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t conceal from you,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;that the justice-of-peace is
      very ill-disposed to your cause. You must have seen that the other day,
      when he refused to receive you. As for Monsieur Dutocq and myself, our
      assistance won&rsquo;t help you much; and besides, my good woman, you are too
      close-mouthed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur asked me if I had laid by a few little savings; and I couldn&rsquo;t
      tell him that I had, be&mdash;because they have gone to keep the h&mdash;house
      of that poor Monsieur Pi&mdash;i&mdash;cot; and now they accuse me of r&mdash;robbing
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lambert sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;that you are making yourself out much
      poorer than you are; and if friend Peyrade here, who seems to be more in
      your confidence, hadn&rsquo;t his tongue tied by the rules of his profession&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, hastily, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything of madame&rsquo;s affairs.
      She asked me to draw up a petition on a matter in which there was nothing
      judicial or financial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;Madame had doubtless gone to see
      you about this petition the day Dutocq met her at your office, the morning
      after our dinner at the Rocher de Cancale&mdash;when you were such a
      Roman, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without seeming to attach any importance to the reminiscence, he
      added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good Madame Lambert, I&rsquo;ll ask my patron to speak to the
      justice-of-peace, and, if I get a chance, I&rsquo;ll speak to him myself; but, I
      repeat it, he is very much prejudiced against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lambert retired with many curtseys and protestations of gratitude.
      When she was fairly gone la Peyrade remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to believe that that woman came to me about a petition;
      and yet nothing was ever truer. She is thought a saint in the street she
      lives in, and that old man they accuse her of robbing is actually kept
      alive by her devotion, so I&rsquo;m told. Consequently, the neighbors have put
      it into the good woman&rsquo;s head to apply for the Montyon prize; and it was
      for the purpose of putting her claims in legal shape that she applied to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear! dear! the Montyon prize!&rdquo; cried Cerizet; &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s an idea! My
      good fellow, we ought to have cultivated it before,&mdash;I, especially,
      as banker of the poor, and you, their advocate. As for this client of
      yours, it is lucky for her Monsieur Picot&rsquo;s relatives are not members of
      the French academy; it is in the correctional police-court, sixth chamber,
      where they mean to give her the reward of virtue. However, to come back to
      what we were talking about. I tell you that after all your tergiversations
      you had better settle down peaceably; and I advise you, as your countess
      did, to go and see du Portail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and what is he?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a little old man,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;as shrewd as a weasel. He
      gives me the idea of having dealings with the devil. Go and see him!
      Sight, as they say, costs nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;perhaps I will; but, first of all, I want you to
      find out for me about this Comtesse de Godollo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you care about her? She is nothing but a supernumerary, that
      countess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my reasons,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;you can certainly get some
      information about her in three days; I&rsquo;ll come and see you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;you seem to me to be amusing yourself
      with things that don&rsquo;t pay; you haven&rsquo;t fallen in love with that
      go-between, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague take him!&rdquo; thought la Peyrade; &ldquo;he spies everything; there&rsquo;s no
      hiding anything from him! No,&rdquo; he said, aloud, &ldquo;I am not in love; on the
      contrary, I am very cautious. I must admit that this marriage with a crazy
      girl doesn&rsquo;t attract me, and before I go a step into it I want to know
      where I put my feet. These crooked proceedings are not reassuring, and as
      so many influences are being brought to bear, I choose to control one by
      another. Therefore don&rsquo;t play sly, but give me all the information you get
      into your pouch about Madame la Comtesse Torna de Godollo. I warn you I
      know enough to test the veracity of your report; and if I see you are
      trying to overreach me I&rsquo;ll break off short with your du Portail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to overreach you, monseigneur!&rdquo; replied Cerizet, in the tone and
      manner of Frederic Lemaitre. &ldquo;Who would dare attempt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced those words in a slightly mocking tone, Dutocq appeared,
      accompanied by his little clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, seeing la Peyrade and Cerizet together; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
      the trinity reconstituted! but the object of the alliance, the &lsquo;casus
      foederis,&rsquo; has floated off. What have you done to that good Brigitte, la
      Peyrade? She is after your blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Thuillier?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moliere was reversed; here was Tartuffe inquiring for Orgon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier began by not being very hostile to you; but it now seems that
      the seizure business has taken a good turn, and having less need of you he
      is getting drawn into his sister&rsquo;s waters; and if the tendency continues,
      I haven&rsquo;t a doubt that he&rsquo;ll soon come to think you deserving of hanging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m out of it all,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;and if anybody ever catches
      me in such a mess again!&mdash;Well, adieu, my friends,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And
      you, Cerizet, as to what we were speaking about, activity, safety, and
      discretion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When la Peyrade reached the courtyard of the municipal building, he was
      accosted by Madame Lambert, who was lying in wait for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur wouldn&rsquo;t believe, I am sure,&rdquo; she said, in a deprecating tone,
      &ldquo;the villainous things that Monsieur Cerizet said about me; monsieur knows
      it was the little property I received from my uncle in England that I
      placed in his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;but you must understand that with all these
      rumors set about by your master&rsquo;s relatives the prize of virtue is
      desperately endangered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is God&rsquo;s will that I am not to have it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought also to understand how important it is for your interests to
      keep secret the other service which I did for you. At the first appearance
      of any indiscretion on your part that money, as I told you, will be
      peremptorily returned to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! monsieur may be easy about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then good-bye to you, my dear,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, in a friendly
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned to leave her, a nasal voice was heard from a window on the
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Lambert!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, who, suspecting the colloquy, had gone to
      the staircase window to make sure of it. &ldquo;Madame Lambert! Monsieur Dutocq
      has returned; you may come up and see him, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impossible for la Peyrade to prevent the conference, although he knew the
      secret of that twenty-five thousand francs ran the greatest danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said to himself as he walked away, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a run of
      ill-luck; and I don&rsquo;t know where it will end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Brigitte&rsquo;s nature there was such an all-devouring instinct of
      domination, that it was without regret, and, we may even say, with a sort
      of secret joy that she saw the disappearance of Madame de Godollo. That
      woman, she felt, had a crushing superiority over her; and this, while it
      had given a higher order to the Thuillier establishment, made her ill at
      ease. When therefore the separation took place, which was done, let us
      here say, on good terms, and under fair and honorable pretexts,
      Mademoiselle Thuillier breathed more freely. She felt like those kings
      long swayed by imperious and necessary ministers, who celebrate within
      their hearts the day when death delivers them from a master whose services
      and rival influence they impatiently endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was not far from having the same sentiment about la Peyrade. But
      Madame de Godollo was only the elegance, whereas la Peyrade was the
      utility of the house they had now simultaneously abandoned; and after the
      lapse of a few days, a terrible need of Theodose made itself felt in the
      literary and political existence of his dear, good friend. The municipal
      councillor found himself suddenly appointed to draft an important report.
      He was unable to decline the task, saddled as he was with the reputation,
      derived from his pamphlet, of being a man of letters and an able writer;
      therefore, in presence of the perilous honor conferred upon him by his
      colleagues of the general Council, he sat down terrified by his solitude
      and his insufficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain did he lock himself into his study, gorge himself with black
      coffee, mend innumerable pens, and write a score of times at the head of
      his paper (which he was careful to cut of the exact dimensions as that
      used by la Peyrade) the solemn words: &ldquo;Report to the Members of the
      Municipal Council of the City of Paris,&rdquo; followed, on a line by itself, by
      a magnificent <i>Messieurs</i>&mdash;nothing came of it! He was fain to
      issue furious from his study, complaining of the horrible household racket
      which &ldquo;cut the thread of his ideas&rdquo;; though really no greater noise than
      the closing of a door or the opening of a closet or the moving of a chair
      had made itself heard. All this, however, did not help the advancement of
      the work, which remained, as before&mdash;simply begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most fortunately, it happened that Rabourdin, wanting to make some change
      in his apartment, came, as was proper, to submit his plan to the owner of
      the house. Thuillier granted cordially the request that was made to him,
      and then discoursed to his tenant about the report with which he was
      charged,&mdash;being desirous, he said, to obtain his ideas on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabourdin, to whom no administrative question was foreign, very readily
      threw upon the subject a number of very clear and lucid ideas. He was one
      of those men to whom the quality of the intellect to which they address
      themselves is more or less indifferent; a fool, or a man of talent who
      will listen to them, serves equally well to think aloud to, and they are,
      as a stimulant, about the same thing. After Rabourdin had said his say, he
      observed that Thuillier had not understood him; but he had listened to
      himself with pleasure, and he was, moreover, grateful for the attention,
      obtuse as it was, of his hearer, and also for the kindliness of the
      landlord in receiving his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have among my papers,&rdquo; he said as he went away, &ldquo;something on this
      subject; I will look it up and send it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, that same evening Thuillier received a voluminous manuscript;
      and he spent the entire night in delving into that precious repository of
      ideas, from which he extracted enough to make a really remarkable report,
      clumsily as the pillage was managed. When read before the council it
      obtained a very great success, and Thuillier returned home radiant and
      much elated by the congratulations he had received. From that moment&mdash;a
      moment that was marked in his life, for even to advanced old age he still
      talked of the &ldquo;report he had had the honor of making to the
      Council-general of the Seine&rdquo;&mdash;la Peyrade went down considerably in
      his estimation; he felt then that he could do very well without the
      barrister, and this thought of emancipation was strengthened by another
      happiness which came to him at almost the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A parliamentary crisis was imminent,&mdash;a fact that caused the ministry
      to think about depriving its adversaries of a theme of opposition which
      always has great influence on public opinion. It resolved therefore to
      relax its rigor, which of late had been much increased against the press.
      Being included in this species of hypocritical amnesty, Thuillier received
      one morning a letter from the barrister whom he had chosen in place of la
      Peyrade. This letter announced that the Council of State had dismissed the
      complaint, and ordered the release of the pamphlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dutocq&rsquo;s prediction was realized. That weight the less within his
      bosom, Thuillier took a swing toward insolence; he chorused Brigitte, and
      came at last to speak of la Peyrade as a sort of adventurer whom he had
      fed and clothed, a tricky fellow who had <i>extracted</i> much money from
      him, and had finally behaved with such ingratitude that he was thankful
      not to count him any longer among his friends. Orgon, in short, was in
      full revolt, and like Dorine, he was ready to cry out: &ldquo;A beggar! who,
      when he came, had neither shoes nor coat worth a brass farthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet, to whom these indignities were reported by Dutocq, would gladly
      have served them up hot to la Peyrade; but the interview in which the
      copying clerk was to furnish information about Madame de Godollo did not
      take place at the time fixed. La Peyrade made his own discoveries in this
      wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursued by the thought of the beautiful Hungarian, and awaiting, or rather
      not awaiting the result of Cerizet&rsquo;s inquiry, he scoured Paris in every
      direction, and might have been seen, like the idlest of loungers, in the
      most frequented places, his heart telling him that sooner or later he must
      meet the object of his ardent search.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;it was towards the middle of October&mdash;the autumn,
      as frequently happens in Paris, was magnificent, and along the boulevards,
      where the Provencal was airing his love and his melancholy, the out-door
      life and gaiety were as animated as in summer. On the boulevard des
      Italiens, formerly known as the boulevard de Gand, as he lounged past the
      long line of chairs before the Cafe de Paris, where, mingled with a few
      women of the Chaussee d&rsquo;Antin accompanied by their husbands and children,
      may be seen toward evening a cordon of nocturnal beauties waiting only a
      gloved hand to gather them, la Peyrade&rsquo;s heart received a cruel shock.
      From afar, he thought he saw his adored countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone, in a dazzling toilet scarcely authorized by the place and
      her isolation; before her, mounted on a chair, trembled a tiny lap-dog,
      which she stroked from time to time with her beautiful hands. After
      convincing himself that he was not mistaken, la Peyrade was about to dart
      upon that celestial vision, when he was forestalled by a dandy of the most
      triumphant type. Without throwing aside his cigar, without even touching
      his hat, this handsome young man began to converse with the barrister&rsquo;s
      ideal; but when she saw la Peyrade making towards her the siren must have
      felt afraid, for she rose quickly, and taking the arm of the man who was
      talking to her, she said aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your carriage here, Emile? Mabille closes to-night, and I should like
      to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name of that disreputable place thus thrown in the face of the unhappy
      barrister, was a charity, for it saved him from a foolish action, that of
      addressing, on the arm of the man who had suddenly made himself her
      cavalier, the unworthy creature of whom he was thinking a few seconds
      earlier with so much tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not worth insulting,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as lovers are beings who will not allow their foothold to be taken
      from them easily, the Provencal was neither convinced nor resigned as yet.
      Not far from the place which his countess had left, sat another woman,
      also alone; but this one was ripe with years, with feathers on her head,
      and beneath the folds of a cashmere shawl she concealed the plaintive
      remains of tarnished elegance and long past luxury. There was nothing
      imposing about this sight, nor did it command respect, but the contrary.
      La Peyrade went up to the woman without ceremony and addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know that woman who has just gone away on the
      arm of a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, monsieur; I know nearly all the women who come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her name is?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Komorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she as impregnable as the fortress of that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our readers will doubtless remember that at the time of the insurrection
      in Hungary our ears were battered by the press and by novelists about the
      famous citadel of Komorn; and la Peyrade knew that by assuming a tone of
      indifference or flippancy he was more likely to succeed with his
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has monsieur any idea of making her acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;but she is a woman who makes people
      think of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very dangerous woman, monsieur,&rdquo; added his companion; &ldquo;a fearful
      spendthrift, but with no inclination to return generously what is done for
      her. I can speak knowingly of that; when she first arrived here from
      Berlin, six months ago, she was very warmly recommended to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at that time I had in the environs of Ville d&rsquo;Avray a very beautiful
      place, with park and coverts and a stream for fishing; but as I was alone
      I found it dull, and several of these ladies and gentlemen said to me,
      &lsquo;Madame Louchard, why don&rsquo;t you organize parties in the style of
      picnics?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Louchard!&rdquo; repeated la Peyrade, &ldquo;are you any relation to Monsieur
      Louchard of the commercial police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife, monsieur, but legally separated from him. A horrid man who
      wants me to go back to him; but I, though I&rsquo;m ready to forgive most
      things, I can&rsquo;t forgive a want of respect; just imagine that he dared to
      raise his hand against me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, trying to bring her back to the matter in hand;
      &ldquo;you organized those picnics, and Madame de Godo&mdash;I mean Madame
      Komorn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was one of my first lodgers. It was there she made acquaintance with an
      Italian, a handsome man, and rich, a political refugee, but one of the
      lofty kind. You understand it didn&rsquo;t suit my purposes to have intrigues
      going on in my house; still the man was so lovable, and so unhappy because
      he couldn&rsquo;t make Madame Komorn like him, that at last I took an interest
      in this particular love affair; which produced a pot of money for madame,
      for she managed to get immense sums out of that Italian. Well, would you
      believe that when&mdash;being just then in great need&mdash;I asked her to
      assist me with a trifling little sum, she refused me point-blank, and left
      my house, taking her lover with her, who, poor man, can&rsquo;t be thankful for
      the acquaintance now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What happened to him?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened to him that this serpent knows every language in Europe; she
      is witty and clever to the tips of her fingers, but more manoeuvring than
      either; so, being, as it appears, in close relations to the police, she
      gave the government a lot of papers the Italian left about carelessly, on
      which they expelled him from France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after his departure, Madame Komorn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since then, she has had a good many adventures and upset several
      fortunes, and I thought she had left Paris. For the last two months she
      was nowhere to be seen, but three days ago she reappeared, more brilliant
      than ever. My advice to monsieur is not to trust himself in that
      direction; and yet, monsieur looks to me a Southerner, and Southerners
      have passions; perhaps what I have told him will only serve to spur them
      up. However, being warned, there&rsquo;s not so much danger, and she is a most
      fascinating creature&mdash;oh! very fascinating. She used to love me very
      much, though we parted such ill-friends; and just now, seeing me here, she
      came over and asked my address, and said she should come and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, rising and bowing to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bow was returned with extreme coldness; his abrupt departure did not
      show him to be a man of <i>serious</i> intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be supposed from the lively manner in which la Peyrade made these
      inquiries that his cure though sudden was complete; but this surface of
      indifference and cool self-possession was only the stillness of the
      atmosphere that precedes a storm. On leaving Madame Louchard, la Peyrade
      flung himself into a street-cab and there gave way to a passion of tears
      like that Madame Colleville had witnessed on the day he believed that
      Cerizet had got the better of him in the sale of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his position now? The investment of the Thuilliers, prepared with
      so much care, all useless; Flavie well avenged for the odious comedy he
      had played with her; his affairs in a worse state than they were when
      Cerizet and Dutocq had sent him, like a devouring wolf, into the sheepfold
      from which he had allowed the stupid sheep to drive him; his heart full of
      revengeful projects against the woman who had so easily got the better of
      what he thought his cleverness; and the memory, still vivid, of the
      seductions to which he had succumbed,&mdash;such were the thoughts and
      emotions of his sleepless night, sleepless except for moments shaken by
      agitated dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day la Peyrade could think no more; he was a prey to fever, the
      violence of which became sufficiently alarming for the physician who
      attended him to take all precautions against the symptoms now appearing of
      brain fever: bleeding, cupping, leeches, and ice to his head; these were
      the agreeable finale to his dream of love. We must hasten to add, however,
      that this violent crisis in the physical led to a perfect cure of the
      mental being. The barrister came out of his illness with no other
      sentiment than cold contempt for the treacherous Hungarian, a sentiment
      which did not even rise to a desire for vengeance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. GIVE AND TAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once more afoot, and reckoning with his future, on which he had lost so
      much ground, la Peyrade asked himself if he had not better try to renew
      his relations with the Thuilliers, or whether he should be compelled to
      fall back on the rich crazy woman who had bullion where others have
      brains. But everything that reminded him of his disastrous campaign was
      repulsive to him; besides, what safety was there in dealing with this du
      Portail, a man who could use such instruments for his means of action?
    </p>
    <p>
      Great commotions of the soul are like those storms which purify the
      atmosphere; they induce reflection, they counsel good and strong
      resolutions. La Peyrade, as the result of the cruel disappointment he had
      just endured, examined his own soul. He asked himself what sort of
      existence was this, of base and ignoble intrigue, which he had led for the
      past year? Was there for him no better, no nobler use to make of the
      faculties he felt within him? The bar was open to him as to others; that
      was a broad, straight path which could lead him to all the satisfaction of
      legitimate ambition. Like Figaro, who displayed more science and
      calculation in merely getting a living than statesmen had shown in
      governing Spain for a hundred years, he, la Peyrade, in order to install
      and maintain himself in the Thuillier household and marry the daughter of
      a clarionet and a smirched coquette, had spent more mind, more art, and&mdash;it
      should also be said, because in a corrupt society it is an element that
      must be reckoned&mdash;more dishonesty than was needed to advance him in
      some fine career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of such connections as Dutocq and Cerizet,&rdquo; he said to himself;
      &ldquo;enough of the nauseating atmosphere of the Minards and Phellions and
      Collevilles and Barniols and all the rest of them. I&rsquo;ll shake off this
      province &lsquo;intra muros,&rsquo; a thousand times more absurd and petty than the
      true provinces; they at least, side by side with their pettiness, have
      habits and customs that are characteristic, a &lsquo;sui generis&rsquo; dignity; they
      are frankly what they are, the antipodes of Parisian life; this other is
      but a parody of it. I will fling myself upon Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of these reflections, la Peyrade went to see two or three
      barristers who had offered to introduce him at the Palais in secondary
      cases. He accepted those that presented themselves at once, and three
      weeks after his rupture with the Thuilliers he was no longer the &ldquo;advocate
      of the poor,&rdquo; but a barrister pleading before the Royal court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already pleaded several cases successfully when he received, one
      morning, a letter which greatly disturbed him. The president of the order
      of barristers requested him to come to his office at the Palais in the
      course of the day, as he had something of importance to say to him. La
      Peyrade instantly thought of the transaction relating to the purchase of
      the house on the boulevard de la Madeleine; it must have come, he thought,
      to the ears of the Council of Discipline; if so he was accountable to that
      tribunal and he knew its severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this du Portail, whom he had never yet been to see, in spite of his
      conditional promise to Cerizet, was likely to have heard the whole story
      of that transaction from Cerizet himself. Evidently all means were thought
      good by that man, judging by the use he had made of the Hungarian woman.
      In his savage determination to bring about the marriage with the crazy
      girl, had this virulent old man denounced him? On seeing him courageously
      and with some appearance of success entering a career in which he might
      find fame and independence, had his persecutor taken a step to make that
      career impossible? Certainly there was enough likelihood in this
      suggestion to make the barrister wait in cruel anxiety for the hour when
      he might learn the true nature of the alarming summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      While breakfasting rather meagrely, his mind full of these painful
      conjectures, Madame Coffinet, who had the honor to take charge of his
      housekeeping, came up to ask if he would see Monsieur Etienne Lousteau.
      [See &ldquo;The Great Man of the Provinces in Paris.&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau! la Peyrade had an idea that he had heard the name
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him into my office,&rdquo; he said to the portress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he met his visitor, whose face did not seem utterly unknown
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said this new-comer, &ldquo;I had the honor of breakfasting with you
      not long ago at Vefour&rsquo;s; I was invited to that meeting, afterwards rather
      disturbed, by Monsieur Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very good!&rdquo; said the barrister, offering a chair; &ldquo;you are attached
      to the staff of a newspaper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editor-in-chief of the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rsquo; and it is on the subject of
      that paper that I have now called to see you. You know what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible you are not aware that the ministry met with terrible
      defeat last night? But instead of resigning, as every one expected, they
      have dissolved the Chamber and appeal to the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing of all that,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;I have not read the
      morning papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued Lousteau, &ldquo;all parliamentary ambitions will take the
      field, and, if I am well informed, Monsieur Thuillier, already member of
      the Council-general, intends to present himself as candidate for election
      in the 12th arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that is likely to be his intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, I desire to place at his disposition an instrument the
      value of which I am confident you will not underestimate. The &lsquo;Echo de la
      Bievre,&rsquo; a specialist paper, can have a decisive influence on the election
      in that quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would be disposed,&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, &ldquo;to make that paper support
      Monsieur Thuillier&rsquo;s candidacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that,&rdquo; replied Lousteau. &ldquo;I have come to propose to Monsieur
      Thuillier that he purchase the paper itself. Once the proprietor of it he
      can use it as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the first place,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;what is the present condition
      of the enterprise? In its character as a specialist journal&mdash;as you
      called it just now&mdash;it is a sheet I have seldom met with; in fact, it
      would be entirely unknown to me were it not for the remarkable article you
      were so good as to devote to Thuillier&rsquo;s defence at the time his pamphlet
      was seized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne Lousteau bowed his thanks, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position of the paper is excellent; we can give it to you on easy
      terms, for we were intending shortly to stop the publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange for a prosperous journal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it happens to be quite natural. The founders, who were
      all representatives of the great leather interest, started this paper for
      a special object. That object has been attained. The &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre&rsquo; 
      has therefore become an effect without a cause. In such a case,
      stockholders who don&rsquo;t like the tail end of matters, and are not eager
      after small profits, very naturally prefer to sell out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, &ldquo;does the paper pay its costs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Lousteau, &ldquo;is a point we did not consider; we were not
      very anxious to have subscribers; the mainspring of the whole affair was
      direct and immediate action on the ministry of commerce to obtain a higher
      duty on the introduction of foreign leathers. You understand that outside
      of the tannery circle, this interest was not very exciting to the general
      reader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought, however,&rdquo; persisted la Peyrade, &ldquo;that a newspaper,
      however circumscribed its action, would be a lever which depended for its
      force on the number of its subscribers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for journals which aim for a single definite thing,&rdquo; replied
      Lousteau, dogmatically. &ldquo;In that case, subscribers are, on the contrary,
      an embarrassment, for you have to please and amuse them, and in so doing,
      the real object has to be neglected. A newspaper which has a definite and
      circumscribed object ought to be like the stroke of that pendulum which,
      striking steadily on one spot, fires at a given hour the cannon of the
      Palais-Royal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;what price do you put upon a publication
      which has no subscribers, does not pay its expenses, and has until now
      been devoted to a purpose totally different from that you propose for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before answering,&rdquo; returned Lousteau, &ldquo;I shall ask you another question.
      Have you any intention of buying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s according to circumstances,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade. &ldquo;Of course I must
      see Thuillier; but I may here remark to you that he knows absolutely
      nothing about newspaper business. With his rather bourgeois ideas, the
      ownership of a newspaper will seem to him a ruinous speculation.
      Therefore, if, in addition to an idea that will scare him, you suggest an
      alarming price, it is useless for me to speak to him. I am certain he
      would never go into the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lousteau. &ldquo;I have told you we should be reasonable; these
      gentlemen have left the whole matter in my hands. Only, I beg to remark
      that we have had propositions from other parties, and in giving Monsieur
      Thuillier this option, we intended to pay him a particular courtesy. When
      can I have your answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, I think; shall I have the honor of seeing you at your own
      house, or at the office of the journal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;to-morrow I will come here, at the same hour, if
      that is convenient to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, bowing out his visitor, whom he was
      inclined to think more consequential than able.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the manner in which the barrister had received the proposition to
      become an intermediary to Thuillier, the reader must have seen that a
      rapid revolution had taken place in his ideas. Even if he had not received
      that extremely disquieting letter from the president of the order of
      barristers, the new situation in which Thuillier would be placed if
      elected to the Chamber gave him enough to think about. Evidently his dear
      good friend would have to come back to him, and Thuillier&rsquo;s eagerness for
      election would deliver him over, bound hand and foot. Was it not the right
      moment to attempt to renew his marriage with Celeste? Far from being an
      obstacle to the good resolutions inspired by his amorous disappointment
      and his incipient brain fever, such a finale would ensure their
      continuance and success. Moreover, if he received, as he feared, one of
      those censures which would ruin his dawning prospects at the bar, it was
      with the Thuilliers, the accomplices and beneficiaries of the cause of his
      fall, that his instinct led him to claim an asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts stirring in his mind la Peyrade obeyed the summons and
      went to see the president of the order of barristers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not mistaken; a very circumstantial statement of his whole
      proceeding in the matter of the house had been laid before his brethren of
      the bar; and the highest dignitary of the order, after stating that an
      anonymous denunciation ought always to be received with great distrust,
      told him that he was ready to receive and welcome an explanation. La
      Peyrade dared not entrench himself in absolute denial; the hand from which
      he believed the blow had come seemed to him too resolute and too able not
      to hold the proofs as well. But, while admitting the facts in general, he
      endeavored to give them an acceptable coloring. In this, he saw that he
      had failed, when the president said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the vacation which is now beginning I shall report to the Council
      of the order the charges made against you, and the statements by which you
      have defended yourself. The Council alone has the right to decide on a
      matter of such importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus dismissed, la Peyrade felt that his whole future at the bar was
      imperilled; but at least he had a respite, and in case of condemnation a
      new project on which to rest his head. Accordingly, he put on his gown,
      which he had never worn till now, and went to the fifth court-room, where
      he was employed upon a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the court-room, carrying one of those bundles of legal papers
      held together by a strip of cotton which, being too voluminous to hold
      under the arm, are carried by the hand and the forearm pressed against the
      chest, la Peyrade began to pace about the Salle des Pas perdus with that
      harassed look of business which denotes a lawyer overwhelmed with work.
      Whether he had really excited himself in pleading, or whether he was
      pretending to be exhausted to prove that his gown was not a dignity for
      show, as it was with many of his legal brethren, but an armor buckled on
      for the fight, it is certain that, handkerchief in hand, he was mopping
      his forehead as he walked, when, in the distance, he spied Thuillier, who
      had evidently just caught sight of him, and was beginning on his side to
      manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was not surprised by the encounter. On leaving home he had told
      Madame Coffinet he was going to the Palais, and should be there till three
      o&rsquo;clock, and she might send to him any persons who called on business. Not
      wishing to let Thuillier accost him too easily, he turned abruptly, as if
      some thought had changed his purpose, and went and seated himself on one
      of the benches which surround the walls of that great antechamber of
      Justice. There he undid his bundle, took out a paper, and buried himself
      in it with the air of a man who had not had time to examine in his study a
      case he was about to plead. It is not necessary to say that while doing
      this the Provencal was watching the manoeuvres of Thuillier out of the
      corner of his eye. Thuillier, believing that la Peyrade was really
      occupied in some serious business, hesitated to approach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after sundry backings and fillings the municipal councillor made
      up his mind, and sailing straight before the wind he headed for the spot
      he had been reconnoitring for the last ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Theodose!&rdquo; he cried as soon as he had got within hailing
      distance. &ldquo;Do you come to the Palais now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; replied Theodose, &ldquo;that barristers at the Palais are
      like Turks at Constantinople, where a friend of mine affirmed you could
      see a good many. It is YOU whom it is rather surprising to see here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Thuillier, carelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come about that cursed
      pamphlet. Is there ever any end to your legal bothers? I was summoned here
      this morning, but I don&rsquo;t regret it, as it gives me the happy chance of
      meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, tying up his bundle. &ldquo;I am very glad to see
      you, but I must leave you now; I have an appointment, and I suppose you
      want to do your business at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done it,&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to Olivier Vinet, that mortal enemy of yours? he sits in
      that court,&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Thuillier, naming another official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; said the barrister; &ldquo;that fellow must have the gift
      of ubiquity; he has been all the morning in the fifth court-room, and has
      just this minute given a judgment on a case I pleaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier colored, and got out of his hobble as best he could. &ldquo;Oh, hang
      it!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;those men in gowns are all alike, I don&rsquo;t know one from
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade shrugged his shoulders and said aloud, but as if to himself:
      &ldquo;Always the same; crafty, crooked, never straightforward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, rather nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of you, my dear fellow, who take me for an imbecile, as if I and the
      whole world didn&rsquo;t know that your pamphlet business came to an end two
      weeks ago. Why, then, summon you to court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was sent for,&rdquo; said Thuillier, with embarrassment; &ldquo;something
      about registry fees,&mdash;it is all Greek to me, I can&rsquo;t comprehend their
      scrawls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they chose,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;precisely the very day when the
      Moniteur, announcing the dissolution of the Chamber, made you think about
      being a candidate for the 12th arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, &ldquo;what has my candidacy to do with the fees I
      owe to the court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, dryly. &ldquo;The court is a thing essentially
      amiable and complaisant. &lsquo;Tiens!&rsquo; it said to itself, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s this good
      Monsieur Thuillier going to be a candidate for the Chamber; how hampered
      he&rsquo;ll be by his attitude to his ex-friend Monsieur de la Peyrade, with
      whom he wishes now he hadn&rsquo;t quarrelled. I&rsquo;ll summon him for fees he
      doesn&rsquo;t owe; that will bring him to the Palais where la Peyrade comes
      daily; and in that way he can meet him by chance, and so avoid taking a
      step which would hurt his self-love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are mistaken!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, breaking the ice. &ldquo;I used
      so little craft, as you call it, that I&rsquo;ve just come from your house,
      there! and your portress told me where to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I like this frankness; I can get on with
      men who play above-board. Well, what do you want of me? Have you come to
      talk about your election? I have already begun to work for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really?&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, feeling under his gown for his pocket and
      bringing out a paper, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I scribbled just now in the court-room
      while the lawyer on the other side rambled on like an expert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it about?&rdquo; asked Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

                                         &ldquo; yearly,     181,320 &rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to set up a paper?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, in dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, &ldquo;I want nothing at all; you are the one to be asked
      if you want to be a deputy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly I do; because, when you urged me to become a municipal
      councillor, you put the idea into my head. But reflect, my dear Theodose,
      one hundred and eighty one thousand three hundred and twenty francs to put
      out! Have I a fortune large enough to meet such a demand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you could very well support that expense, for
      considering the end you want to obtain there is nothing exorbitant in it.
      In England they make much greater sacrifices to get a seat in Parliament;
      but in any case, I beg you to observe that the costs are very high on that
      estimate, and some could be cut off altogether. For instance, you would
      not want an administrator. You, yourself, an old accountant, and I, an old
      journalist, can very well manage the affair between us. Also rent, we
      needn&rsquo;t count that; you have your old apartment in the rue Saint-Dominique
      which is not yet leased; that will make a fine newspaper office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that costs off two thousand four hundred francs a year,&rdquo; said
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something; but your error consists in calculating on the
      yearly cost. When do the elections take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two months,&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; two months will cost you thirty thousand francs, even
      supposing the paper had no subscribers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;the expense is certainly less than I thought at
      first. But does a newspaper really seem to you essential?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So essential that without that power in our hands, I won&rsquo;t have anything
      to do with the election. You don&rsquo;t seem to see, my poor fellow, that in
      going to live in the other quarter you have lost, electorally speaking, an
      immense amount of ground. You are no longer the man of the place, and your
      election could be balked by the cry of what the English call
      &lsquo;absenteeism.&rsquo; This makes your game very hard to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;but there are so many things wanted
      besides money,&mdash;a name for one thing, a manager, editorial staff, and
      so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A name, we have one made to hand; editors, they are you and I and a few
      young fellows who grow on every bush in Paris. As for the manager, I have
      a man in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name is it?&rdquo; asked Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L&rsquo;Echo de la Bievre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is already a paper of that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, and that&rsquo;s why I give my approval to the affair. Do you think
      I should be fool enough to advise you to start an entirely new paper?
      &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre!&rsquo; that title is a treasure to a man who wants support
      for his candidacy in the 12th arrondissement. Say the word only, and I put
      that treasure into your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! by buying it; it can be had for a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, you see,&rdquo; said Thuillier in a discouraged tone; &ldquo;you never
      counted in the cost of purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you dwell on nothings!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, hunching his shoulders; &ldquo;we
      have other and more important difficulties to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other difficulties?&rdquo; echoed Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade; &ldquo;do you suppose that after all that has
      taken place between us I should boldly harness myself to your election
      without knowing exactly what benefit I am to get for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Thuillier, rather astonished, &ldquo;I thought that friendship was a
      good exchange for such services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but when the exchange consists in one side giving all and the other
      side nothing, friendship gets tired of that sort of sharing, and asks for
      something a little better balanced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Theodose, what have I to offer you that you have not already
      rejected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rejected it, because it was offered without heartiness, and seasoned
      with Mademoiselle Brigitte&rsquo;s vinegar; every self-respecting man would have
      acted as I did. Give and keep don&rsquo;t pass, as the old legal saying is; but
      that is precisely what you persist in doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;I think you took offence very unreasonably; but the engagement
      might be renewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;but I will not put myself at the mercy of
      either the success of the election or Mademoiselle Celeste&rsquo;s caprices. I
      claim the right to something positive and certain. Give and take; short
      accounts make good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly agree with you,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;and I have always treated
      you with too much good faith to fear any of these precautions you now want
      to take. But what guarantees do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want that the husband of Celeste should manage your election, and not
      Theodose de la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By hurrying things as much as possible, so Brigitte said, it would still
      take fifteen days; and just think, with the elections only eight weeks
      off, to lose two of them doing nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day after to-morrow,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;the banns can be published for
      the first time at the mayor&rsquo;s office, in the intervals of publication some
      things could be done, for though the publishing of the banns is not a step
      from which there is no retreat, it is at least a public pledge and a long
      step taken; after that we can get your notary to draw the contract at
      once. Moreover, if you decide on buying this newspaper, I shouldn&rsquo;t be
      afraid that you would go back on me, for you don&rsquo;t want a useless horse in
      your stable, and without me I am certain you can&rsquo;t manage him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Thuillier, going back to his objections,
      &ldquo;suppose that affair proves too onerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to say that you are the sole judge of the conditions of
      the purchase. I don&rsquo;t wish any more than you do to buy a pig in a poke. If
      to-morrow you authorize me, I won&rsquo;t say to buy, but to let these people
      know that you may possibly make the purchase, I&rsquo;ll confer with one of them
      on your behalf, and you may be certain that I&rsquo;ll stand up for your
      interests as if they were my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as soon as the paper is purchased we are to fix the day for signing
      the contract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Thuillier; &ldquo;but will you bind yourself to use your utmost
      influence on the election?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if it were my own,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;which, by the bye, is not
      altogether an hypothesis. I have already received suggestions about my own
      candidacy, and if I were vindictive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thuillier, with humility, &ldquo;you would make a better
      deputy than I; but you are not of the required age, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a better reason than that,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;you are my friend;
      I find you again what you once were, and I shall keep the pledges I have
      given you. As for the election, I prefer that people say of me, &lsquo;He makes
      deputies, but will be none himself.&rsquo; Now I must leave you and keep my
      appointment. To-morrow in my own rooms, come and see me; I shall have
      something to announce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whoso has ever been a newspaper man will ever be one; that horoscope is as
      sure and certain as that of drunkards. Whoever has tasted that feverishly
      busy and relatively lazy and independent life; whoever has exercised that
      sovereignty which criticises intellect, art, talent, fame, virtue,
      absurdity, and even truth; whoever has occupied that tribune erected by
      his own hands, fulfilled the functions of that magistracy to which he is
      self-appointed,&mdash;in short, whosoever has been, for however brief a
      span, that proxy of public opinion, looks upon himself when remanded to
      private life as an exile, and the moment a chance is offered to him puts
      out an eager hand to snatch back his crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason when Etienne Lousteau went to la Peyrade, a former
      journalist, with an offer of the weapon entitled the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rdquo;
       all the latter&rsquo;s instincts as a newspaper man were aroused, in spite of
      the very inferior quality of the blade. The paper had failed; la Peyrade
      believed he could revive it. The subscribers, on the vendor&rsquo;s own showing,
      were few and far between, but he would exercise upon them a &ldquo;compelle
      intrare&rdquo; both powerful and irresistible. In the circumstances under which
      the affair was presented to him it might surely be considered provincial.
      Threatened with the loss of his position at the bar, he was thus
      acquiring, as we said before, a new position and that of a &ldquo;detached
      fort&rdquo;; compelled, as he might be, to defend himself, he could from that
      vantage-ground take the offensive and oblige his enemies to reckon with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Thuillier side, the newspaper would undoubtedly make him a
      personage of considerable importance; he would have more power on the
      election; and by involving their capital in an enterprise which, without
      him, they would feel a gulf and a snare, he bound them to him by
      self-interests so firmly that there was nothing to fear from their caprice
      or ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      This horizon, rapidly taken in during Etienne Lousteau&rsquo;s visit, had fairly
      dazzled the Provencal, and we have seen the peremptory manner in which
      Thuillier was forced into accepting with some enthusiasm the discovery of
      this philosopher&rsquo;s-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cost of the purchase was ridiculously insignificant. A bank-note for
      five hundred francs, for which Etienne Lousteau never clearly accounted to
      the share-holders, put Thuillier in possession of the name, property,
      furniture, and good-will of the newspaper, which he and la Peyrade at once
      busied themselves in reorganizing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. IN WHICH CERIZET PRACTISES THE HEALING ART AND
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ART OF POISONING ON THE SAME DAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      While this regeneration was going on, Cerizet went one morning to see du
      Portail, with whom la Peyrade was now more than ever determined to hold no
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the little old man to the poor man&rsquo;s banker, &ldquo;what effect did
      the news we gave to the president of the bar produce on our man? Did the
      affair get wind at the Palais?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Cerizet, whose intercourse, no doubt pretty frequent, with du
      Portail had put him on a footing of some familiarity with the old man,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no question of that now. The eel has wriggled out of our hands;
      neither softness nor violence has any effect upon that devil of a man. He
      has quarrelled with the bar, and is in better odor than ever with
      Thuillier. &lsquo;Necessity,&rsquo; says Figaro, &lsquo;obliterates distance.&rsquo; Thuillier
      needs him to push his candidacy in the quartier Saint-Jacques, so they
      kissed and made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no doubt,&rdquo; said du Portail, without much appearance of feeling, &ldquo;the
      marriage is fixed for an early day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s another piece of work on hand. That
      crazy fellow has persuaded Thuillier to buy a newspaper, and he&rsquo;ll make
      him sink forty thousand francs in it. Thuillier, once involved, will want
      to get his money back, and in my opinion they are bound together for the
      rest of their days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What paper is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a cabbage-leaf that calls itself the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre&rsquo;!&rdquo; replied
      Cerizet with great scorn; &ldquo;a paper which an old hack of a journalist on
      his last legs managed to set up in the Mouffetard quarter by the help of a
      lot of tanners&mdash;that, you know, is the industry of the quarter. From
      a political and literary point of view the affair is nothing at all, but
      Thuillier has been made to think it a masterly stroke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for local service to the election the instrument isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo;
       remarked du Portail. &ldquo;La Peyrade has talent, activity, and much resource
      of mind; he may make something out of that &lsquo;Echo.&rsquo; Under what political
      banner will Thuillier present himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier,&rdquo; replied the beggars&rsquo; banker, &ldquo;is an oyster; he hasn&rsquo;t any
      opinions. Until the publication of his pamphlet he was, like all those
      bourgeois, a rabid conservative; but since the seizure he has gone over to
      the Opposition. His first stage will probably be the Left-centre; but if
      the election wind should blow from another quarter, he&rsquo;ll go straight
      before it to the extreme left. Self-interest, for those bourgeois, that&rsquo;s
      the measure of their convictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;this new combination of la Peyrade&rsquo;s may
      assume the importance of a political danger from the point of view of my
      opinions, which are extremely conservative and governmental.&rdquo; Then, after
      a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he added, &ldquo;I think you did newspaper work once upon
      a time; I remember &lsquo;the courageous Cerizet.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the usurer, &ldquo;I even managed one with la Peyrade,&mdash;an
      evening paper; and a pretty piece of work we did, for which we were finely
      recompensed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you do it again,&mdash;journalism, I
      mean,&mdash;with la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet looked at du Portail in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are you the devil, monsieur? Can nothing ever be
      hidden from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;I know a good many things. But what has been
      settled between you and la Peyrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, remembering my experience in the business, and not knowing whom
      else to get, he offered to make me manager of the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;but it was quite probable. Did
      you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conditionally; I asked time for reflection. I wanted to know what you
      thought of the offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! I think that out of an evil that can&rsquo;t be remedied we should
      get, as the proverb says, wing or foot. I had rather see you inside than
      outside of that enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but in order to get into it there&rsquo;s a difficulty. La Peyrade
      knows I have debts, and he won&rsquo;t help me with the thirty-three-thousand
      francs&rsquo; security which must be paid down in my name. I haven&rsquo;t got them,
      and if I had, I wouldn&rsquo;t show them and expose myself to the insults of
      creditors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have a good deal left of that twenty-five thousand francs la
      Peyrade paid you not more than two months ago,&rdquo; remarked du Portail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two thousand two hundred francs and fifty centimes,&rdquo; replied
      Cerizet. &ldquo;I was adding it up last night; the rest has all gone to pay off
      pressing debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you have paid your debts you haven&rsquo;t any creditors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, those I&rsquo;ve paid, but those I haven&rsquo;t paid I still owe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that your liabilities were more than twenty-five
      thousand francs?&rdquo; said du Portail, in a tone of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a man go into bankruptcy for less?&rdquo; replied Cerizet, as though he
      were enunciating a maxim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see I am expected to pay that sum myself,&rdquo; said du Portail,
      crossly; &ldquo;but the question is whether the utility of your presence in this
      enterprise is worth to me the interest on one hundred and thirty-three
      thousand, three hundred and thirty-three francs, thirty-three centimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;if I were once installed near Thuillier, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t despair of soon putting him and la Peyrade at loggerheads. In
      the management of a newspaper there are lots of inevitable disagreements,
      and by always taking the side of the fool against the clever man, I can
      increase the conceit of one and wound the conceit of the other until life
      together becomes impossible. Besides, you spoke just now of political
      danger; now the manager of a newspaper, as you ought to know, when he has
      the intellect to be something better than a man of straw, can quietly give
      his sheet a push in the direction wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal of truth in that,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;but defeat to la
      Peyrade, that&rsquo;s what I am thinking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I think I have another nice little insidious means
      of demolishing him with Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what it is, then!&rdquo; exclaimed du Portail, impatiently; &ldquo;you go round
      and round the pot as if I were a man it would do you some good to finesse
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Cerizet, coming out with it, &ldquo;that some time ago
      Dutocq and I were much puzzled to know how la Peyrade was, all of a
      sudden, able to make that payment of twenty-five thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the old man quickly, &ldquo;have you discovered the origin of that
      very improbable sum in our friend&rsquo;s hands; and is that origin shady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall judge,&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he related in all its details the affair of Madame Lambert,&mdash;adding,
      however, that on questioning the woman closely at the office of the
      justice-of-peace, after the meeting with la Peyrade, he had been unable to
      extract from her any confession, although by her whole bearing she had
      amply confirmed the suspicions of Dutocq and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Lambert, rue du Val-de-Grace, No. 9; at the house of Monsieur
      Picot, professor of mathematics,&rdquo; said du Portail, as he made a note of
      the information. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;come back and see me to-morrow,
      my dear Monsieur Cerizet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But please remark,&rdquo; said the usurer, &ldquo;that I must give an answer to la
      Peyrade in the course of to-day. He is in a great hurry to start the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; you must accept, asking a delay of twenty-four hours to obtain
      your security. If, after making certain inquiries I see it is more to my
      interests not to meddle in the affair, you can get out of it by merely
      breaking your word; you can&rsquo;t be sent to the court of assizes for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Independently of a sort of inexplicable fascination which du Portail
      exercised over his agent, he never lost an opportunity to remind him of
      the very questionable point of departure of their intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Cerizet returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You guessed right,&rdquo; said du Portail. &ldquo;That woman Lambert, being obliged
      to conceal the existence of her booty, and wanting to draw interest on her
      stolen property, must have taken it into her head to consult la Peyrade;
      his devout exterior may have recommended him to her. She probably gave him
      that money without taking a receipt. In what kind of money was Dutocq
      paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In nineteen thousand-franc notes, and twelve of five-hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely it,&rdquo; said du Portail. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be the slightest
      doubt left. Now, what use do you expect to make of this information
      bearing upon Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to put it into his head that la Peyrade, to whom he is going to
      give his goddaughter and heiress, is over head and ears in debt; that he
      makes enormous secret loans; and that in order to get out of his
      difficulties he means to gnaw the newspaper to the bone; and I shall
      insinuate that the position of a man so much in debt must be known to the
      public before long, and become a fatal blow to the candidate whose right
      hand he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad,&rdquo; said du Portail; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s another and even more
      conclusive use to be made of the discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, master; I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; said Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thuillier has not yet been able, has he, to explain to himself the reason
      of the seizure of the pamphlet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;La Peyrade was telling me only yesterday,
      by way of explaining Thuillier&rsquo;s idiotic simplicity, that he had believed
      a most ridiculous bit of humbug. The &lsquo;honest bourgeois&rsquo; is persuaded that
      the seizure was instigated by Monsieur Olivier Vinet, substitute to the
      procureur-general. The young man aspired for a moment to the hand of
      Mademoiselle Colleville, and the worthy Thuillier has been made to imagine
      that the seizure of his pamphlet was a revenge for the refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said du Portail; &ldquo;to-morrow, as a preparation for the other
      version of which you are to be the organ, Thuillier shall receive from
      Monsieur Vinet a very sharp and decided denial of the abuse of power he
      foolishly gave ear to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he?&rdquo; said Cerizet, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But another explanation must take its place,&rdquo; continued du Portail; &ldquo;you
      must assure Thuillier that he is the victim of police machinations. That
      is all the police is good for, you know,&mdash;machinations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that very well; I&rsquo;ve made that affirmation scores of times when I
      was working for the republican newspapers and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were &lsquo;the courageous Cerizet,&rsquo;&rdquo; interrupted du Portail. &ldquo;Well,
      the present machination, here it is. The government was much displeased at
      seeing Thuillier elected without its influence to the Council-general of
      the Seine; it was angry with an independent and patriotic citizen who
      showed by his candidacy that he could do without it; and it learned,
      moreover, that this excellent citizen was preparing a pamphlet on the
      subject, always a delicate one, of the finances, as to which this
      dangerous adversary had great experience. So, what did this essentially
      corrupt government do? It suborned a man in whom, as it learned, Thuillier
      placed confidence, and for a sum of twenty-five thousand francs (a mere
      trifle to the police), this treacherous friend agreed to insert into the
      pamphlet three or four phrases which exposed it to seizure and caused its
      author to be summoned before the court of assizes. Now the way to make the
      explanation clinch the doubt in Thuillier&rsquo;s mind is to let him know that
      the next day la Peyrade, who, as Thuillier knew, hadn&rsquo;t a sou, paid Dutocq
      precisely that very sum of twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Cerizet, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a bad trick. Fellows of the
      Thuillier species will believe anything against the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see, then,&rdquo; continued du Portail, &ldquo;whether Thuillier will want
      to keep such a collaborator beside him, and above all, whether he will be
      so eager to give him his goddaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strong man, monsieur,&rdquo; said Cerizet, again expressing his
      approbation; &ldquo;but I must own that I feel some scruples at the part
      assigned me. La Peyrade came and offered me the management of the paper,
      and, you see, I should be working to evict him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that lease he knocked you out of in spite of his promises, have you
      forgotten that?&rdquo; asked the little old man. &ldquo;Besides, are we not aiming for
      his happiness, though the obstinate fellow persists in thwarting our
      benevolent intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;that the result will absolve me. Yes, I&rsquo;ll go
      resolutely along the ingenious path you&rsquo;ve traced out for me. But there&rsquo;s
      one thing more: I can&rsquo;t fling my revelation at Thuillier&rsquo;s head at the
      very first; I must have time to prepare the way for it, but that security
      will have to be paid in immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Monsieur Cerizet,&rdquo; said du Portail, in a tone of authority;
      &ldquo;if the marriage of la Peyrade to my ward takes place it is my intention
      to reward your services, and the sum of thirty thousand francs will be
      your perquisite. Now, thirty thousand from one side and twenty-five
      thousand from the other makes precisely fifty-five thousand francs that
      the matrimonial vicissitudes of your friend la Peyrade will have put into
      your pocket. But, as country people do at the shows of a fair, I shall not
      pay till I come out. If you take that money out of your own hoard I shall
      feel no anxiety; you will know how to keep it from the clutches of your
      creditors. If, on the contrary, my money is at stake, you will have
      neither the same eagerness nor the same intelligence in keeping it out of
      danger. Therefore arrange your affairs so that you can pay down your own
      thirty-three thousand; in case of success, that sum will bring you in
      pretty nearly a hundred per cent. That&rsquo;s my last word, and I shall not
      listen to any objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet had no time to make any, for at that moment the door of du
      Portail&rsquo;s study opened abruptly, and a fair, slender woman, whose face
      expressed angelic sweetness, entered the room eagerly. On her arm, wrapped
      in handsome long clothes, lay what seemed to be the form of an infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that naughty Katte insisted that the doctor was not
      here. I knew perfectly well that I had seen him enter. Well, doctor,&rdquo; she
      continued, addressing Cerizet, &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the condition of
      my little one, not satisfied at all; she is very pallid, and has grown so
      thin. I think she must be teething.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Du Portail made Cerizet a sign to accept the role so abruptly thrust upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, evidently,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is the teeth; children always turn pale at
      that crisis; but there&rsquo;s nothing in that, my dear lady, that need make you
      anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so, doctor,&rdquo; said the poor crazed girl, whom our
      readers have recognized as du Portail&rsquo;s ward, Lydie de la Peyrade; &ldquo;but
      see her dear little arms, how thin they are getting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then taking out the pins that fastened the swathings, she exhibited to
      Cerizet a bundle of linen which to her poor distracted mind represented a
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, no,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;she is a trifle thin, it is true, but the
      flesh is firm and her color excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darling!&rdquo; said Lydie, kissing her dream lovingly. &ldquo;I do think she is
      better since morning. What had I better give her, doctor? Broth disgusts
      her, and she won&rsquo;t take soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;try panada. Does she like sweet things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried the poor girl, her face brightening, &ldquo;she adores them.
      Would chocolate be good for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;but without vanilla; vanilla is very
      heating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get what they call health-chocolate,&rdquo; said Lydie, with all the
      intonations of a mother, listening to the doctor as to a god who reassured
      her. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;please ring for Bruneau, and tell him to go to
      Marquis at once and get some pounds of that chocolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruneau has just gone out,&rdquo; said her guardian; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no hurry, he
      shall go in the course of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, she is going to sleep,&rdquo; said Cerizet, anxious to put an end to the
      scene, which, in spite of his hardened nature, he felt to be painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the girl, replacing the bandages and rising; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put her to
      bed. Adieu, doctor; it is very kind of you to come sometimes without being
      sent for. If you knew how anxious we poor mothers are, and how, with a
      word or two, you can do us such good. Ah, there she is crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so sleepy,&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be much better in her cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll play her that sonata of Beethoven that dear papa was so
      fond of; it is wonderful how calming it is. Adieu, doctor,&rdquo; she said
      again, pausing on the threshold of the door. &ldquo;Adieu, kind doctor!&rdquo; And she
      sent him a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet was quite overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;that she is an angel,&mdash;never the least
      ill-humor, never a sharp word; sad sometimes, but always caused by a
      feeling of motherly solicitude. That is what first gave the doctors the
      idea that if reality could take the place of her constant hallucination
      she might recover her reason. Well, this is the girl that fool of a
      Peyrade refuses, with the accompaniment of a magnificent &lsquo;dot.&rsquo; But he
      must come to it, or I&rsquo;ll forswear my name. Listen,&rdquo; he added as the sound
      of a piano came to them; &ldquo;hear! what talent! Thousands of sane women can&rsquo;t
      compare with her; they are not as reasonable as she is, except on the
      surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata, played from the soul with a perfection of shades
      and tones that filled her hardened hearer with admiration, had ceased to
      sound, Cerizet said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, monsieur; la Peyrade refuses an angel, a treasure, a
      pearl, and if I were in his place&mdash;But we shall bring him round to
      your purpose. Now I shall serve you not only with zeal, but with
      enthusiasm, I may say fanaticism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cerizet was concluding this oath of fidelity at the door of the study,
      he heard a woman&rsquo;s voice which was not that of Lydie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he in his study, the dear commander?&rdquo; said that voice, with a slightly
      foreign accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, but please come into the salon. Monsieur is not alone; I
      will tell him you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the voice of Katte, the old Dutch maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, go this way,&rdquo; said du Portail quickly to Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he opened a hidden door which led through a dark corridor directly to
      the staircase, whence Cerizet betook himself to the office of the &ldquo;Echo de
      la Bievre,&rdquo; where a heated discussion was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article by which the new editors of every newspaper lay before the
      public their &ldquo;profession of faith,&rdquo; as the technical saying is, always
      produces a laborious and difficult parturition. In this particular case it
      was necessary, if not openly to declare Thuillier&rsquo;s candidacy, to at least
      make it felt and foreseen. The terms of the manifesto, after la Peyrade
      had made a rough draft of it, were discussed at great length. This
      discussion took place in Cerizet&rsquo;s presence, who, acting on du Portail&rsquo;s
      advice, accepted the management, but postponed the payment of the security
      till the next day, through the latitude allowed in all administrations for
      the accomplishment of that formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleverly egged on by this master-knave, who, from the start, made himself
      Thuillier&rsquo;s flatterer, the discussion became stormy, and presently bitter;
      but as, by the deed of partnership the deciding word was left to la
      Peyrade in all matters concerning the editorship, he finally closed it by
      sending the manifesto, precisely as he had written it, to the printing
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was incensed at what he called an abuse of power, and finding
      himself alone with Cerizet later in the day, he hastened to pour his
      griefs and resentments into the bosom of his faithful manager, thus
      affording the latter a ready-made and natural opportunity to insinuate the
      calumnious revelation agreed upon with du Portail. Leaving the knife in
      the wound, Cerizet went out to make certain arrangements to obtain the
      money necessary for his bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tortured by the terrible revelation, Thuillier could not keep it to
      himself; he felt the need of confiding it, and of talking over the course
      he would be compelled to take by this infernal discovery. Sending for a
      carriage he drove home, and half an hour later he had told the whole story
      to his Egeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte had from the first very vehemently declared against all the
      determinations made by Thuillier during the last few days. For no purpose
      whatever, not even for the sake of her brother&rsquo;s election, would she agree
      to a renewal of the relation to la Peyrade. In the first place, she had
      treated him badly, and that was a strong reason for disliking him; then,
      in case that adventurer, as she now called him, married Celeste, the fear
      of her authority being lessened gave her a species of second-sight; she
      had ended by having an intuitive sense of the dark profundities of the
      man&rsquo;s nature, and now declared that under no circumstances and for no
      possible price would she make one household with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruin yourself if you choose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are the master of that, and
      you can do as you like; a fool and his money are soon parted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, she listened to her brother&rsquo;s confidences it was not with
      reproaches, but, on the contrary, with a crow of triumph, celebrating the
      probable return of her power, that she welcomed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;it is well to know at last that the man
      is a spy. I always thought so, the canting bigot! Turn him out of doors
      without an explanation. WE don&rsquo;t want him to work that newspaper. This
      Monsieur Cerizet seems, from what you tell me, the right sort of man, and
      we can get another manager. Besides, when Madame de Godollo went away she
      promised to write to me; and she can easily put us in the way of finding
      some one. Poor, dear Celeste! what a fate we were going to give her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you run on!&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;La Peyrade, my dear, is so far only
      accused. He must be heard in his defence. And besides, there&rsquo;s a deed that
      binds us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very good!&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;I see how it will be; you&rsquo;ll let that man
      twist you round his finger again. A deed with a spy! As if there could be
      deeds with such fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, be calm, my good Brigitte,&rdquo; returned Thuillier. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t
      do anything hastily. Certainly, if la Peyrade cannot furnish a
      justification, clear, categorical, and convincing, I shall decide to break
      with him, and I&rsquo;ll prove to you that I am no milksop. But Cerizet himself
      is not certain; these are mere inductions, and I only came to consult you
      as to whether I ought, or ought not, to demand an explanation outright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt about it,&rdquo; replied Brigitte. &ldquo;You ought to demand an
      explanation and go to the bottom of this thing; if you don&rsquo;t, I cast you
      off as my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That suffices,&rdquo; said Thuillier, leaving the room with solemnity; &ldquo;you
      shall see that we will come to an understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XI. EXPLANATIONS AND WHAT CAME OF THEM
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his return to the office after his conference with Brigitte, Thuillier
      found la Peyrade at his post as editor-in-chief, and in a position of much
      embarrassment, caused by the high hand he had reserved for himself as the
      sole selector of articles and contributors. At this moment, Phellion,
      instigated by his family, and deeply conscious of his position on the
      reading-committee of the Odeon, had come to offer his services as dramatic
      critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear monsieur,&rdquo; he said, continuing his remarks to la Peyrade, after
      inquiring of Thuillier about his health, &ldquo;I was a great student of the
      theatre in my youth; the stage and its scenic effects continue to have for
      me peculiar attractions; and the white hairs which crown my brow to-day
      seem to me no obstacle to my allowing your interesting publication to
      profit by the fruit of my studies and my experience. As member of the
      reading-committee of the Odeon theatre, I am conversant with the modern
      drama, and&mdash;if I may be quite sure of your discretion&mdash;I will
      even confide to you that among my papers it would not be impossible for me
      to find a certain tragedy entitled &lsquo;Sapor,&rsquo; which in my young days won me
      some fame when read in salons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, endeavoring to gild the refusal he should be forced
      to give, &ldquo;why not try to have it put upon the stage? We might be able to
      help you in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;the director of any theatre to whom we
      should recommend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Phellion. &ldquo;In the first place, as member of the
      reading-committee of the Odeon, having to sit in judgment upon others, it
      would not become me to descend into the arena myself. I am an old athlete,
      whose business it is to judge of blows he can no longer give. In this
      sense, criticism is altogether within my sphere, and all the more because
      I have certain views on the proper method of composing dramatic
      feuilletons which I think novel. The &lsquo;castigat ridendo mores&rsquo; ought to be,
      according to my humble lights, the great law, I may say the only law of
      the stage. I should therefore show myself pitiless for those works, bred
      of imagination, in which morality has no part, and to which mothers of
      families&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;for interrupting you; but before allowing
      you to take the trouble to develop your poetical ideas, I ought to tell
      you that we have already made arrangements for our dramatic criticism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;an honest man must keep his
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;we have our dramatic critic, little thinking that
      you would offer us your valuable assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Phellion, suddenly becoming crafty,&mdash;for there is
      something in the newspaper atmosphere, impossible to say what, which flies
      to the head, the bourgeois head especially,&mdash;&ldquo;since you are good
      enough to consider my pen capable of doing you some service, perhaps a
      series of detached thoughts on different subjects, to which I should
      venture to give the name of &lsquo;Diversities,&rsquo; might be of a nature to
      interest your readers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with a maliciousness that was quite lost upon
      Phellion, &ldquo;thoughts, especially in the style of la Rochefoucauld or la
      Bruyere, might do. What do you think yourself, Thuillier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reserved to himself the right to leave the responsibility of refusals,
      as far as he could, to the proprietor of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I imagine that thoughts, especially if detached, cannot be very
      consecutive,&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently not,&rdquo; replied Phellion; &ldquo;detached thoughts imply the idea of a
      very great number of subjects on which the author lets his pen stray
      without the pretension of presenting a whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will of course sign them?&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied Phellion, alarmed. &ldquo;I could not put myself on exhibition
      in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your modesty, which by the bye I understand and approve, settles the
      matter,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;Thoughts are a subject altogether individual,
      which imperatively require to be personified by a name. You must be
      conscious of this yourself. &lsquo;Divers Thoughts by Monsieur Three-Stars&rsquo; says
      nothing to the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Phellion was about to make objections, Thuillier, who was in a
      hurry to begin his fight with la Peyrade, cut the matter short rather
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Phellion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beg your pardon for not being able to
      enjoy the pleasure of your conversation any longer, but we have to talk,
      la Peyrade and I, over a matter of much importance, and in newspaper
      offices this devilish time runs away so fast. If you are willing, we will
      postpone the question to another day. Madame Phellion is well, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly well,&rdquo; said the great citizen, rising, and not appearing to
      resent his dismissal. &ldquo;When does your first number appear?&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;it
      is eagerly awaited in the arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow I think our confession of faith will make its appearance,&rdquo;
       replied Thuillier, accompanying him to the door. &ldquo;You will receive a copy,
      my dear friend. We shall meet again soon, I hope. Come and see us, and
      bring that manuscript; la Peyrade&rsquo;s point of view may be a little
      arbitrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this balm shed upon his wound, Phellion departed, and Thuillier rang
      the bell for the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you recognize the gentlemen who has just gone out the next time you
      see him?&rdquo; asked Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, m&rsquo;sieu, his round ball of a head is too funny to forget;
      besides, it is Monsieur Phellion; haven&rsquo;t I opened the door to him
      hundreds of times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whenever he comes again neither I nor Monsieur de la Peyrade will
      be here. Remember that&rsquo;s a positive rule. Now leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, when the two partners were alone, &ldquo;how you
      manage bores. But take care; among the number there may be electors. You
      did right to tell Phellion you would send him a copy of the paper; he has
      a certain importance in the quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t allow our time to be taken up by all the
      dull-heads who come and offer their services. But now you and I have to
      talk, and talk very seriously. Be seated and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, laughing, &ldquo;that journalism
      is making you into something very solemn? &lsquo;Be seated, Cinna,&rsquo;&mdash;Caesar
      Augustus couldn&rsquo;t have said it otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cinnas, unfortunately, are more plentiful than people think,&rdquo; replied
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still under the goad of the promise he had made to Brigitte, and he
      meant to fulfil it with cutting sarcasm. The top continued the whirling
      motion imparted to it by the old maid&rsquo;s lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade took a seat at the round table. As he was puzzled to know what
      was coming, he endeavored to seem unconcerned, and picking up the large
      scissors used for the loans which all papers make from the columns of
      their brethren of the press, he began to snip up a sheet of paper, on
      which, in Thuillier&rsquo;s handwriting, was an attempt at a leading article,
      never completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though la Peyrade was seated and expectant, Thuillier did not begin
      immediately; he rose and went toward the door which stood ajar, with the
      intention of closing it. But suddenly it was flung wide open, and Coffinet
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will monsieur,&rdquo; said Coffinet to la Peyrade, &ldquo;receive two ladies? They
      are very well-dressed, and the young one ain&rsquo;t to be despised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I let them in?&rdquo; said la Peyrade to Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, since they are here,&rdquo; growled Thuillier; &ldquo;but get rid of them as
      soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coffinet&rsquo;s judgment on the toilet of the two visitors needs revision. A
      woman is well-dressed, not when she wears rich clothes, but when her
      clothes present a certain harmony of shapes and colors which form an
      appropriate and graceful envelope to her person. Now a bonnet with a
      flaring brim, surmounted by nodding plumes, an immense French cashmere
      shawl, worn with the awkward inexperience of a young bride, a plaid silk
      gown with enormous checks and a triple tier of flounces with far too many
      chains and trinkets (though to be just, the boots and gloves were
      irreproachable), constituted the apparel of the younger of these ladies.
      As for the other, who seemed to be in the tow of her dressy companion, she
      was short, squat, and high-colored, and wore a bonnet, shawl, and gown
      which a practised eye would at once have recognized as second hand.
      Mothers of actresses are always clothed by this very economical process.
      Their garments, condemned to the service of two generations, reverse the
      order of things, and go from descendants to ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing two chairs, la Peyrade inquired, &ldquo;To whom have I the honor of
      speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the younger visitor, &ldquo;I am a dramatic artist, and as I am
      about to make my first appearance in this quarter, I allow myself to hope
      that a journal of this locality will favor me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what theatre?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Folies, where I am engaged for the Dejazets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Folies?&rdquo; echoed la Peyrade, in a tone that demanded an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folies-Dramatiques,&rdquo; interposed the agreeable Madame Cardinal, whom the
      reader has doubtless recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you appear?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week, monsieur,&mdash;a fairy piece in which I play five parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll encourage her, monsieur, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Madame Cardinal, in a
      coaxing voice; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so young, and I can certify she works day and
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; said Olympe, with authority, &ldquo;the public will judge me; all I
      want is that monsieur will kindly promise to notice my debut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said la Peyrade in a tone of dismissal,
      beginning to edge the pair to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olympe Cardinal went first, leaving her mother to hurry after her as best
      she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home to no one!&rdquo; cried Thuillier to the office-boy as he closed the
      door and slipped the bolt. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, addressing la Peyrade, &ldquo;we will
      talk. My dear fellow,&rdquo; he went on, starting with irony, for he remembered
      to have heard that nothing was more confusing to an adversary, &ldquo;I have
      heard something that will give you pleasure. I know now why MY pamphlet
      was seized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he looked fixedly at la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; said the latter in a natural tone of voice, &ldquo;it was seized
      because they chose to seize it. They wanted to find, and they found,
      because they always find the things they want, what the king&rsquo;s adherents
      call &lsquo;subversive doctrine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are wrong,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;the seizure was planned, concocted,
      and agreed upon before publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between whom?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between those who wanted to kill the pamphlet, and the wretches who were
      paid to betray it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in any case, those who paid,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;got mighty little
      for their money; for, persecuted though it was, I don&rsquo;t see that your
      pamphlet made much of a stir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who sold may have done better?&rdquo; said Thuillier with redoubled
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who sold,&rdquo; returned la Peyrade, &ldquo;were the cleverer of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I know,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;that you think a great deal of cleverness;
      but allow me to tell you that the police, whose hand I see in all this,
      doesn&rsquo;t usually throw its money away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again he looked fixedly at la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the barrister, without winking, &ldquo;you have discovered that the
      police had plotted in advance the smothering of your pamphlet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear fellow; and what is more, I know the actual sum paid to the
      person who agreed to carry out this honorable plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, thinking a moment,&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps I know
      the person; but as for the money, I don&rsquo;t know a word about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can tell you the amount. It was twenty-five&mdash;thousand&mdash;francs,&rdquo;
       said Thuillier, dwelling on each word; &ldquo;that was the sum paid to Judas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! excuse me, my dear fellow, but twenty-five thousand francs is a good
      deal of money. I don&rsquo;t deny that you have become an important man; but you
      are not such a bugbear to the government as to lead it to make such
      sacrifices. Twenty-five thousand francs is as much as would ever be given
      for the suppression of one of those annoying pamphlets about the Civil
      list. But our financial lucubrations didn&rsquo;t annoy in that way; and such a
      sum borrowed from the secret-service money for the mere pleasure of
      plaguing you, seems to me rather fabulous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; said Thuillier, acrimoniously, &ldquo;this honest go-between had
      some interest in exaggerating my value. One thing is very sure; this
      monsieur had a debt of twenty-five thousand francs which harassed him
      much; and a short time before the seizure this same monsieur, who had no
      means of his own, paid off that debt; and unless you can tell me where
      else he got the money, the inference I think is not difficult to draw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was la Peyrade&rsquo;s turn to look fixedly at Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Thuillier,&rdquo; he said, raising his voice, &ldquo;let us get out of
      enigmas and generalities; will you do me the favor to name that person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, striking his hand upon the table, &ldquo;I shall
      not name him, because of the sentiments of esteem and affection which
      formerly united us; but you have understood me, Monsieur la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have known,&rdquo; said the Provencal, in a voice changed by
      emotion, &ldquo;that in bringing a serpent to this place I should soon be soiled
      by his venom. Poor fool! do you not see that you have made yourself the
      echo of Cerizet&rsquo;s calumny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet has nothing to do with it; on the contrary, he has told me the
      highest good of you. How was it, not having a penny the night before,&mdash;and
      I had reason to know it,&mdash;that you were able to pay Dutocq the round
      sum of twenty-five thousand francs the next day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was not Dutocq who told you that. He is not a man to
      wrestle with an enemy of my strength without a strong interest in it. It
      was Cerizet; he&rsquo;s the infamous calumniator, from whose hands I wrenched
      the lease of your house near the Madeleine,&mdash;Cerizet, whom in
      kindness, I went to seek on his dunghill that I might give him the chance
      of honorable employment; that is the wretch, to whom a benefit is only an
      encouragement to treachery. Tiens! if I were to tell you what that man is
      I should turn you sick with disgust; in the sphere of infamy he has
      discovered worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Thuillier made an able reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about Cerizet except through you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you
      introduced him to me as a manager, offering every guarantee; but, allowing
      him to be blacker than the devil, and supposing that this communication
      comes from him, I don&rsquo;t see, my friend, that all that makes YOU any the
      whiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt I was to blame,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;for putting such a man into
      relations with you; but we wanted some one who understood journalism, and
      that value he really had for us. But who can ever sound the depths of
      souls like his? I thought him reformed. A manager, I said to myself, is
      only a machine; he can do no harm. I expected to find him a man of straw;
      well, I was mistaken, he will never be anything but a man of mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is very fine,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;but those twenty-five thousand
      francs found so conveniently in your possession, where did you get them?
      That is the point you are forgetting to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to reason about it,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;a man of my character in the
      pay of the police and yet so poor that I could not pay the ten thousand
      francs your harpy of a sister demanded with an insolence which you
      yourself witnessed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;if the origin of this money is honest, as I
      sincerely desire it may be, what hinders you from telling me how you got
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;the history of that money is a secret
      entrusted to me professionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you told me yourself that the statutes of your order forbid
      all barristers from doing business of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us suppose,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that I have done something not
      absolutely regular; it would be strange indeed after what I risked, as you
      know, for you, if you should have the face to reproach me with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor friend, you are trying to shake off the hounds; but you can&rsquo;t
      make me lose the scent. You wish to keep your secret; then keep it. I am
      master of my own confidence and my own esteem; by paying you the forfeit
      stipulated in our deed I take the newspaper into my own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you dismiss me?&rdquo; cried la Peyrade. &ldquo;The money that you
      have put into the affair, all your chances of election, sacrificed to the
      calumnies of such a being as Cerizet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;another editor-in-chief can be
      found; it is a true saying that no man is indispensable. As for election
      to the Chamber I would rather never receive it than owe it to the help of
      one who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, seeing that Thuillier hesitated, &ldquo;or rather, no,
      be silent, for you will presently blush for your suspicions and ask my
      pardon humbly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time la Peyrade saw that without a confession to which he must
      compel himself, the influence and the future he had just recovered would
      be cut from under his feet. Resuming his speech he said, solemnly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember, my friend, that you were pitiless, and, by subjecting
      me to a species of moral torture, you have forced me to reveal to you a
      secret that is not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;I take the whole responsibility upon myself.
      Make me see the truth clearly in this darkness, and if I have done wrong I
      will be the first to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;those twenty-five thousand francs are the
      savings of a servant-woman who came to me and asked me to take them and to
      pay her interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A servant with twenty-five thousand francs of savings! Nonsense; she must
      serve in monstrously rich households.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, she is the one servant of an infirm old savant; and it
      was on account of the discrepancy which strikes your mind that she wanted
      to put her money in my hands as a sort of trustee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! my friend,&rdquo; said Thuillier, flippantly, &ldquo;you said we were in
      want of a romance-feuilletonist; but really, after this, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
      uneasy. Here&rsquo;s imagination for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, angrily, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not believe you. Twenty-five thousand francs savings in the
      service of an old savant! that is about as believable as the officer of La
      Dame Blanche buying a chateau with his pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I prove to you the truth of my words; if I let you put your finger
      upon it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, like Saint Thomas, I shall lower my flag before the
      evidence. Meanwhile you must permit me, my noble friend, to wait until you
      offer me that proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier felt really superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a hundred francs,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;if Brigitte could have
      been here and heard me impeach him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;suppose that without leaving this office, and by
      means of a note which you shall read, I bring into your presence the
      person from whom I received the money; if she confirms what I say will you
      believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal and the assurance with which it was made rather staggered
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know what to do when the time comes,&rdquo; he replied, changing his
      tone. &ldquo;But this must be done at once, now, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, without leaving this office. I should think that was clear
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who will carry the note you write?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, believing that
      by thus examining every detail he was giving proofs of amazing
      perspicacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry the note! why, your own porter of course,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;you
      can send him yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then write it,&rdquo; said Thuillier, determined to push him to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade took a sheet of paper with the new heading and wrote as
      follows, reading the note aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Madame Lambert is requested to call at once, on urgent business,
  at the office of the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rdquo; rue Saint-Dominique
  d&rsquo;Enfer. The bearer of this note will conduct her. She is awaited
  impatiently by her devoted servant,
</pre>
    <p>
      Theodose de la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, will that suit you?&rdquo; said the barrister, passing the paper to
      Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, taking the precaution to fold the letter
      himself and seal it. &ldquo;Put the address,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rang the bell for the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will carry this letter to its address,&rdquo; he said to the man, &ldquo;and
      bring back with you the person named. But will she be there?&rdquo; he asked, on
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than probable,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;in any case, neither you
      nor I will leave this room until she comes. This matter must be cleared
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go!&rdquo; said Thuillier to the porter, in a theatrical tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone, la Peyrade took up a newspaper and appeared to be
      absorbed in its perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier, beginning to get uneasy as to the upshot of the affair,
      regretted that he had not done something the idea of which had come to him
      just too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I ought,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;to have torn up that letter, and not
      driven him to prove his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to do something that might look like retaining la Peyrade in the
      position of which he had threatened to deprive him, he remarked presently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, I have just come from the printing-office; the new type has
      arrived, and I think we might make our first appearance to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade did not answer; but he got up and took his paper nearer to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sulky,&rdquo; thought Thuillier, &ldquo;and if he is innocent, he may well be.
      But, after all, why did he ever bring a man like that Cerizet here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then to hide his embarrassment and the preoccupation of his mind, he sat
      down before the editor&rsquo;s table, took a sheet of the head-lined paper and
      made himself write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently la Peyrade returned to the table and sitting down, took another
      sheet and with the feverish rapidity of a man stirred by some emotion he
      drove his pen over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the corner of his eye, Thuillier tried hard to see what la Peyrade
      was writing, and noticing that his sentences were separated by numbers
      placed between brackets, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens! are you drawing up a parliamentary law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;the law of the vanquished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, the porter opened the door and introduced Madame Lambert,
      whom he had found at home, and who arrived looking rather frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Madame Lambert?&rdquo; asked Thuillier, magisterially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; said the woman, in an anxious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After requesting her to be seated and noticing that the porter was still
      there as if awaiting further orders he said to the man:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do; you may go; and don&rsquo;t let any one disturb us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity and the lordly tone assumed by Thuillier only increased Madame
      Lambert&rsquo;s uneasiness. She came expecting to see only la Peyrade, and she
      found herself received by an unknown man with a haughty manner, while the
      barrister, who had merely bowed to her, said not a word; moreover, the
      scene took place in a newspaper office, and it is a well-known fact that
      to pious persons especially all that relates to the press is infernal and
      diabolical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier to the barrister, &ldquo;it seems to me that nothing
      hinders you from explaining to madame why you have sent for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In order to leave no loophole for suspicion in Thuillier&rsquo;s mind la Peyrade
      knew that he must put his question bluntly and without the slightest
      preparation; he therefore said to her &ldquo;ex abrupto&rdquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish to ask you, madame, if it is not true that about two and a half
      months ago you placed in my hands, subject to interest, the sum, in round
      numbers, of twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though she felt the eyes of Thuillier and those of la Peyrade upon her,
      Madame Lambert, under the shock of this question fired at her point-blank,
      could not restrain a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;twenty-five thousand francs! and where should I
      get such a sum as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade gave no sign on his face of the vexation he might be supposed
      to feel. As for Thuillier, who now looked at him with sorrowful
      commiseration, he merely said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; resumed la Peyrade, &ldquo;you are very certain that you did not place in
      my hands the sum of twenty-five thousand francs; you declare this, you
      affirm it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, monsieur! did you ever hear of such a sum as that in the pocket of a
      poor woman like me? The little that I had, as everybody knows, has gone to
      eke out the housekeeping of that poor dear gentleman whose servant I have
      been for more than twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Thuillier, pompously, &ldquo;seems to me categorical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade still did not show the slightest sign of annoyance; on the
      contrary, he seemed to be playing into Thuillier&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, my dear Thuillier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if necessary I shall call for
      your testimony, that madame here declares that she did not possess
      twenty-five thousand francs and could not therefore have placed them in my
      hands. Now, as the notary Dupuis, in whose hands I fancied I had placed
      them, left Paris this morning for Brussels carrying with him the money of
      all his clients, I have no account with madame, by her own showing, and
      the absconding of the notary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the notary Dupuis absconded?&rdquo; screamed Madame Lambert, driven by this
      dreadful news entirely out of her usual tones of dulcet sweetness and
      Christian resignation. &ldquo;Ah, the villain! it was only this morning that he
      was taking the sacrament at Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pray for a safe journey, probably,&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur talks lightly enough,&rdquo; continued Madame Lambert, &ldquo;though that
      brigand has carried off my savings. But I gave them to monsieur, and
      monsieur is answerable to me for them; he is the only one I know in this
      transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said la Peyrade to Thuillier, pointing to Madame Lambert, whose
      whole demeanor had something of the mother-wolf suddenly bereft of her
      cubs; &ldquo;is that nature? tell me! Do you think now that madame and I are
      playing a comedy for your benefit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thunderstruck at Cerizet&rsquo;s audacity,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;I am
      overwhelmed with my own stupidity; there is nothing for me to do but to
      submit myself entirely to your discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, gaily, &ldquo;excuse me for thus frightening you; the
      notary Dupuis is still a very saintly man, and quite incapable of doing an
      injury to his clients. As for monsieur here, it was necessary that I
      should prove to him that you had really placed that money in my hands; he
      is, however, another myself, and your secret, though known to him, is as
      safe as it is with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very good, monsieur!&rdquo; said Madame Lambert. &ldquo;I suppose these gentlemen
      have no further need of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear madame, and I beg you to pardon me for the little terror I
      was compelled to occasion you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Lambert turned to leave the room with all the appearance of
      respectful humility, but when she reached the door, she retraced her
      steps, and coming close to la Peyrade said, in her smoothest tones:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does monsieur expect to be able to refund me that money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, stiffly, &ldquo;that notaries never return on
      demand the money placed in their hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does monsieur think that if I went to see Monsieur Dupuis himself and
      asked him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, interrupting her, &ldquo;that you would do a most
      ridiculous thing. He received the money from me in my own name, as you
      requested, and he knows only me in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then monsieur will be so kind, will he not, as to get back that money for
      me as soon as possible? I am sure I would not wish to press monsieur, but
      in two or three months from now I may want it; I have heard of a little
      property it would suit me to buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Madame Lambert,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with well-concealed
      irritation, &ldquo;it shall be done as you wish; and in less time, perhaps, than
      you have stated I shall hope to return your money to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t inconvenience monsieur, I trust,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;he told me
      that at the first indiscretion I committed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that is all understood,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, interrupting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have the honor to be the very humble servant of these gentlemen,&rdquo;
       said Madame Lambert, now departing definitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my friend, the trouble you have got me into,&rdquo; said la Peyrade to
      Thuillier as soon as they were alone, &ldquo;and to what I am exposed by my
      kindness in satisfying your diseased mind. That debt was dormant; it was
      in a chronic state; and you have waked it up and made it acute. The woman
      brought me the money and insisted on my keeping it, at a good rate of
      interest. I refused at first; then I agreed to place it in Dupuis&rsquo;s hands,
      explaining to her that it couldn&rsquo;t be withdrawn at once; but subsequently,
      when Dutocq pressed me, I decided, after all, to keep it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dreadfully sorry, dear friend, for my silly credulity. But don&rsquo;t be
      uneasy about the exactions of that woman; we will manage to arrange all
      that, even if I have to make you an advance upon Celeste&rsquo;s &lsquo;dot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My excellent friend,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;it is absolutely necessary that
      we should talk over our private arrangements; to tell you the truth, I
      have no fancy for being hauled up every morning and questioned as to my
      conduct. Just now, while waiting for that woman, I drew up a little
      agreement, which you and I will discuss and sign, if you please, before
      the first number of the paper is issued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;our deed of partnership seems to me to settle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that by a paltry forfeit of five thousand francs, as stated in
      Article 14,&rdquo; interrupted Theodose, &ldquo;you can put me, when you choose, out
      of doors. No, I thank you! After my experience to-day, I want some better
      security than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Cerizet with a lively and all-conquering air, entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My masters!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought the money; and we can now sign
      the bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, remarking that his news was received with extreme coldness, he
      added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; replied Thuillier: &ldquo;I refuse to be associated with
      double-face men and calumniators. We have no need of you or your money;
      and I request you not to honor these precincts any longer with your
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear! dear! dear!&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;so papa Thuillier has let the wool be
      pulled over his eyes again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;you have nothing more to do here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, my boy!&rdquo; said Cerizet, turning to la Peyrade, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ve twisted the
      old bourgeois round your finger again? Well, well, no matter! I think you
      are making a mistake not to go and see du Portail, and I shall tell him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave this house!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, in a threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please remember, my dear monsieur, that I never asked you to employ me; I
      was well enough off before you sent for me, and I shall be after. But I&rsquo;ll
      give you a piece of advice: don&rsquo;t pay the twenty-five thousand francs out
      of your own pocket, for that&rsquo;s hanging to your nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Cerizet put his thirty-three thousand francs in banknotes back
      into his wallet, took his hat from the table, carefully smoothed the nap
      with his forearm and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier had been led by Cerizet into what proved to be a most disastrous
      campaign. Now become the humble servant of la Peyrade, he was forced to
      accept his conditions, which were as follows: five hundred francs a month
      for la Peyrade&rsquo;s services in general; his editorship of the paper to be
      paid at the rate of fifty francs a column,&mdash;which was simply
      enormous, considering the small size of the sheet; a binding pledge to
      continue the publication of the paper for six months, under pain of the
      forfeiture of fifteen thousand francs; an absolute omnipotence in the
      duties of editor-in-chief,&mdash;that is to say, the sovereign right of
      inserting, controlling, and rejecting all articles without being called to
      explain the reasons of his actions,&mdash;such were the stipulations of a
      treaty in duplicate made openly, &ldquo;in good faith,&rdquo; between the contracting
      parties. <i>But</i>, in virtue of another and secret agreement, Thuillier
      gave security for the payment of the twenty-five thousand francs for which
      la Peyrade was accountable to Madame Lambert, binding the said Sieur de la
      Peyrade, in case the payment were required before his marriage with
      Celeste Colleville could take place, to acknowledge the receipt of said
      sum advanced upon the dowry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters being thus arranged and accepted by the candidate, who saw no
      chance of election if he lost la Peyrade, Thuillier was seized with a
      happy thought. He went to the Cirque-Olympique, where he remembered to
      have seen in the ticket-office a former employee in his office at the
      ministry of Finance,&mdash;a man named Fleury; to whom he proposed the
      post of manager. Fleury, being an old soldier, a good shot, and a skilful
      fencer, would certainly make himself an object of respect in a newspaper
      office. The working-staff of the paper being thus reconstituted, with the
      exception of a few co-editors or reporters to be added later, but whom la
      Peyrade, thanks to the facility of his pen, was able for the present to do
      without, the first number of the new paper was launched upon the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier now recommenced the explorations about Paris which we saw him
      make on the publication of his pamphlet. Entering all reading-rooms and
      cafes, he asked for the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rdquo; and when informed, alas, very
      frequently, that the paper was unknown in this or that establishment, &ldquo;It
      is incredible!&rdquo; he would exclaim, &ldquo;that a house which respects itself does
      not take such a widely known paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that, he departed disdainfully, not observing that in many places,
      where this ancient trick of commercial travellers was well understood,
      they were laughing behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the day when the inauguration number containing the
      &ldquo;profession of faith&rdquo; appeared, Brigitte&rsquo;s salon, although the day was not
      Sunday, was filled with visitors. Reconciled to la Peyrade, whom her
      brother had brought home to dinner, the old maid went so far as to tell
      him that, without flattery, she thought his leading article was a famous
      HIT. For that matter, all the guests as they arrived, reported that the
      public seemed enchanted with the first number of the new journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public! everybody knows what that is. To every man who launches a bit
      of writing into the world, the public consists of five or six intimates
      who cannot, without offending the author, avoid knowing something more or
      less of his lucubrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me!&rdquo; cried Colleville, &ldquo;I can truthfully declare that it is the
      first political article I ever read that didn&rsquo;t send me to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;that the leading article seems to me to
      be stamped with vigor joined to an atticism which we may seek in vain in
      the columns of the other public prints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;the matter is very well presented; and besides,
      there&rsquo;s a turn of phrase, a clever diction, that doesn&rsquo;t belong to
      everybody. However, we must wait and see how it keeps on. I fancy that
      to-morrow the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre&rsquo; will be strongly attacked by the other
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what we are hoping for; and if the
      government would only do us the favor to seize us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Fleury, whom Thuillier had also brought home to
      dinner, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to enter upon those functions at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seized!&rdquo; said Dutocq, &ldquo;oh, you won&rsquo;t be seized; but I think the
      ministerial journals will fire a broadside at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Thuillier was at the office as early as eight o&rsquo;clock, in
      order to be the first to receive that formidable salvo. After looking
      through every morning paper he was forced to admit that there was no more
      mention of the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre&rdquo; than if it didn&rsquo;t exist. When la
      Peyrade arrived he found his unhappy friend in a state of consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that surprise you?&rdquo; said the Provencal, tranquilly. &ldquo;I let you enjoy
      yesterday your hopes of a hot engagement with the press; but I knew myself
      that in all probability there wouldn&rsquo;t be the slightest mention of us in
      to-day&rsquo;s papers. Against every paper which makes its debut with some
      distinction, there&rsquo;s always a two weeks&rsquo;, sometimes a two months&rsquo; 
      conspiracy of silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conspiracy of silence!&rdquo; echoed Thuillier, with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what it meant, but the words had a grandeur and a <i>something</i>
      that appealed to his imagination. After la Peyrade had explained to him
      that by &ldquo;conspiracy of silence&rdquo; was meant the agreement of existing
      journals to make no mention of new-comers lest such notice should serve to
      advertise them, Thuillier&rsquo;s mind was hardly better satisfied than it had
      been by the pompous flow of the words. The bourgeois is born so; words are
      coins which he takes and passes without question. For a word, he will
      excite himself or calm down, insult or applaud. With a word, he can be
      brought to make a revolution and overturn a government of his own choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper, however, was only a means; the object was Thuillier&rsquo;s election.
      This was insinuated rather than stated in the first numbers. But one
      morning, in the columns of the &ldquo;Echo,&rdquo; appeared a letter from several
      electors thanking their delegate to the municipal council for the firm and
      frankly liberal attitude in which he had taken on all questions of local
      interests. &ldquo;This firmness,&rdquo; said the letter, &ldquo;had brought down upon him
      the persecution of the government, which, towed at the heels of
      foreigners, had sacrificed Poland and sold itself to England. The
      arrondissement needed a man of such tried convictions to represent it in
      the Chamber,&mdash;a man holding high and firm the banner of dynastic
      opposition, a man who would be, by the mere signification of his name, a
      stern lesson given to the authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enforced by an able commentary from la Peyrade, this letter was signed by
      Barbet and Metivier and all Brigitte&rsquo;s tradesmen (whom, in view of the
      election she had continued to employ since her emigration); also by the
      family doctor and apothecary, and by Thuillier&rsquo;s builder, and Barniol,
      Phellion&rsquo;s son-in-law, who professed to hold rather &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; political
      opinions. As for Phellion himself, he thought the wording of the letter
      not altogether circumspect, and&mdash;always without fear as without
      reproach&mdash;however much he might expect that this refusal would injure
      his son in his dearest interests, he bravely refrained from signing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This trial kite had the happiest effect. The ten or a dozen names thus put
      forward were considered to express the will of the electors and were
      called &ldquo;the voice of the quarter.&rdquo; Thus Thuillier&rsquo;s candidacy made from
      the start such rapid progress that Minard hesitated to put his own claims
      in opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delighted now with the course of events, Brigitte was the first to say
      that the time had come to attend to the marriage, and Thuillier was all
      the more ready to agree because, from day to day, he feared he might be
      called upon to pay the twenty-five thousand francs to Madame Lambert for
      which he had pledged himself. A thorough explanation now took place
      between la Peyrade and the old maid. She told him honestly of the fear she
      felt as to the maintenance of her sovereign authority when a <i>son-in-law</i>
      of his mind and character was established in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we,&rdquo; she ended by saying, &ldquo;are to oppose each other for the rest of
      our days, it would be much better, from the beginning, to make two
      households; we shouldn&rsquo;t be the less friends for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade replied that nothing under the sun would induce him to consent
      to such a plan; on the contrary, he regarded as amongst his happiest
      prospects for the future the security he should feel about the wise
      management of the material affairs of the home in such hands as hers. He
      should have enough to do in the management of outside interests, and he
      could not comprehend, for his part, how she could suppose he had ever had
      the thought of interfering in matters that were absolutely out of his
      province. In short, he reassured her so completely that she urged him to
      take immediate steps for the publication of the banns and the signature of
      the marriage contract,&mdash;declaring that she reserved to herself all
      the preparations relating to Celeste, whose acceptance of this sudden
      conclusion she pledged herself to secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; she said to Celeste the next morning, &ldquo;I think you have
      given up all idea of being Felix Phellion&rsquo;s wife. In the first place, he
      is more of an atheist than ever, and, besides, you must have noticed
      yourself that his mind is quite shaky. You have seen at Madame Minard&rsquo;s
      that Madame Marmus, who married a savant, officer of the Legion of honor,
      and member of the Institute. There&rsquo;s not a more unhappy woman; her husband
      has taken her to live behind the Luxembourg, in the rue Duguay-Trouin, a
      street that is neither paved nor lighted. When he goes out, he doesn&rsquo;t
      know where he is going; he gets to the Champ de Mars when he wants to go
      to the Faubourg Poissoniere; he isn&rsquo;t even capable of giving his address
      to the driver of a street cab; and he is so absent-minded he couldn&rsquo;t tell
      if it were before dinner or after. You can imagine what sort of time a
      woman must have with a man whose nose is always at a telescope snuffing
      stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Felix,&rdquo; said Celeste, &ldquo;is not as absent-minded as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, because he is younger; but with years his
      absent-mindedness and his atheism will both increase. We have therefore
      decided that he is not the husband you want, and we all, your mother,
      father, Thuillier and myself, have determined that you shall take la
      Peyrade, a man of the world, who will make his way, and one who has done
      us great services in the past, and who will, moreover, make your godfather
      deputy. We are disposed to give you, in consideration of him, a much
      larger &lsquo;dot&rsquo; than we should give to any other husband. So, my dear, it is
      settled; the banns are to be published immediately, and this day week we
      sign the contract. There&rsquo;s to be a great dinner for the family and
      intimates, and after that a reception, at which the contract will be
      signed and your trousseau and corbeille exhibited. As I take all that into
      my own hands I&rsquo;ll answer for it that everything shall be of the best kind;
      especially if you are not babyish, and give in pleasantly to our ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, aunt Brigitte,&rdquo; began Celeste, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;but,&rsquo; in the matter,&rdquo; said the old maid, imperiously; &ldquo;it is
      all arranged, and will be carried out, unless, mademoiselle, you pretend
      to have more wisdom than your elders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you choose, aunt,&rdquo; replied Celeste, feeling as if a
      thunder-cloud had burst upon her head, and knowing but too well that she
      had no power to struggle against the iron will which had just pronounced
      her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went at once to pour her sorrows into Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s soul; but
      when she heard her godmother advising patience and resignation the poor
      child felt that from that feeble quarter she could get no help for even
      the slightest effort of resistance, and that her sacrifice was virtually
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precipitating herself with a sort of frenzy into the new element of
      activity thus introduced into her life, Brigitte took the field in the
      making of the trousseau and the purchase of the corbeille. Like many
      misers, who on great occasions come out of their habits and their nature,
      the old maid now thought nothing too good for her purpose; and she flung
      her money about so lavishly that until the day appointed for the signing
      of the contract, the jeweller, dressmaker, milliner, lingere, etc. (all
      chosen from the best establishments in Paris), seemed to occupy the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like a procession,&rdquo; said Josephine, the cook, admiringly, to
      Francoise, the Minards&rsquo; maid; &ldquo;the bell never stops ringing from morning
      till night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A STAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dinner on the great occasion was ordered from Chabot and Potel, and
      not from Chevet, by which act Brigitte intended to prove her initiative
      and her emancipation from the late Madame de Godollo. The invited guests
      were as follows: three Collevilles, including the bride, la Peyrade the
      groom, Dutocq and Fleury, whom he had asked to be his witnesses, the
      extremely limited number of his relatives leaving him no choice, Minard
      and Rabourdin, chosen as witnesses for Celeste, Madame and Mademoiselle
      Minard and Minard junior, two of Thuillier&rsquo;s colleagues in the
      Council-general; the notary Dupuis, charged with the duty of drawing up
      the contract, and lastly, the Abbe Gondrin, director of the consciences of
      Madame Thuillier and Celeste, who was to give the nuptial blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was the former vicar of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, whose great
      refinement of manner and gift of preaching had induced the archbishop to
      remove him from the humble parish where his career had begun to the
      aristocratic church of the Madeleine. Since Madame Thuillier and Celeste
      had again become his parishioners, the young abbe visited them
      occasionally, and Thuillier, who had gone to him to explain, after his own
      fashion, the suitableness of the choice made for Celeste in the person of
      la Peyrade (taking pains as he did so to cast reflections on the religious
      opinions of Felix Phellion), had easily led him to contribute by his
      persuasive words to the resignation of the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came to sit down to table three guests were missing,&mdash;two
      Minards, father and son, and the notary Dupuis. The latter had written a
      note to Thuillier in the morning, excusing himself from the dinner, but
      saying that at nine o&rsquo;clock precisely he would bring the contract and
      place himself at the orders of Mademoiselle Thuillier. As for Julien
      Minard, his mother excused him as being confined to his room with a
      sore-throat. The absence of Minard senior remained unexplained, but Madame
      Minard insisted that they should sit down to table without him; which was
      done, Brigitte ordering that the soup be kept hot for him, because in the
      bourgeois code of manners and customs a dinner without soup is no dinner
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repast was far from gay, and though the fare was better, the vivacity
      and the warmth of the conversation was far, indeed, from that of the
      famous improvised banquet at the time of the election to the
      Council-general. The gaps occasioned by the absence of three guests may
      have been one reason; then Flavie was glum; she had had an interview with
      la Peyrade in the afternoon which ended in tears; Celeste, even if she had
      been content with the choice imposed on her, would scarcely, as a matter
      of propriety, have seemed joyful; in fact, she made no effort to brighten
      a sad face, and dared not look at her godmother, whose own countenance
      gave the impression, if we may so express it, of the long bleating of a
      sheep. The poor girl seeing this feared to exchange a look with her lest
      she might drive her to tears. Thuillier now felt himself, on all sides, of
      such importance that he was pompous and consequential; while Brigitte,
      uneasy out of her own world, where she could lord it over every one
      without competition, seemed constrained and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colleville tried by a few jovialities to raise the temperature of the
      assemblage; but the coarse salt of his witticisms had an effect, in the
      atmosphere in which he produced them, of a loud laugh in a sick-chamber;
      and a mute intimation from his wife, Thuillier, and la Peyrade to <i>behave
      himself</i> put a stopper on his liveliness and turbulent expansion. It
      was somewhat remarkable that the gravest member of the party, aided by
      Rabourdin, was the person who finally warmed up the atmosphere. The Abbe
      Gondrin, a man of a most refined and cultivated mind, had, like every pure
      and well-ordered soul, a fund of gentle gaiety which he was well able to
      communicate, and liveliness was beginning to dawn upon the party when
      Minard entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making his excuses on the ground of important duties, the mayor of
      the eleventh arrondissement, who was in the habit of taking the lead in
      the conversation wherever he went, said, having swallowed a few hasty
      mouthfuls:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs and mesdames, have you heard the great news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, what is it?&rdquo; cried several voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Academy of Sciences received, to-day, at its afternoon session, the
      announcement of a vast discovery: the heavens possess a new star!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; said Colleville; &ldquo;that will help to replace the one that Beranger
      thought was lost when he grieved (to that air of &lsquo;Octavie&rsquo;) over
      Chateaubriand&rsquo;s departure: &lsquo;Chateaubriand, why fly thy land?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This quotation, which he sang, exasperated Flavie, and if the custom had
      been for wives to sit next to their husbands, the former clarionet of the
      Opera-Comique would not have escaped with a mere &ldquo;Colleville!&rdquo; imperiously
      calling him to order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point which gives this great astronomical event a special interest on
      this occasion,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;is that the author of the discovery is
      a denizen of the twelfth arrondissement, which many of you still inhabit,
      or have inhabited. But other points are striking in this great scientific
      fact. The Academy, on the reading of the communication which announced it,
      was so convinced of the existence of this star that a deputation was
      appointed to visit the domicile of the modern Galileo and compliment him
      in the name of the whole body. And yet this star is not visible to either
      the eye or the telescope! It is only by the power of calculation and
      induction that its existence and the place it occupies in the heavens have
      been proved in the most irrefutable manner: &lsquo;There <i>must</i> be <i>there</i>
      a hitherto unknown star; I cannot see it, but I am sure of it,&rsquo;&mdash;that
      is what this man of science said to the Academy, whom he instantly
      convinced by his deductions. And do you know, messieurs, who is this
      Christopher Columbus of a new celestial world? An old man, two-thirds
      blind, who has scarcely eyes enough to walk in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful! Marvellous! Admirable!&rdquo; came from all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of this learned man?&rdquo; asked several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Picot, or, if you prefer it, pere Picot, for that is how they
      call him in the rue du Val-de-Grace, where he lives. He is simply an old
      professor of mathematics, who has turned out several very fine pupils,&mdash;by
      the bye, Felix Phellion, whom we all know, studied under him, and it was
      he who read, on behalf of his blind old master, the communication to the
      Academy this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that name, and remembering the promise Felix had made her to lift
      her to the skies, which, as he said it, she had fancied a sign of madness,
      Celeste looked at Madame Thuillier, whose face had taken a sudden glow of
      animation, and seemed to say to her, &ldquo;Courage, my child! all is not lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Theodose,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;Felix is coming here to-night; you
      must take him aside and get him to give you a copy of that communication;
      it would be a fine stroke of fortune for the &lsquo;Echo&rsquo; to be the first to
      publish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Minard, assuming the answer, &ldquo;that would do good service to
      the public, for the affair is going to make a great noise. The committee,
      not finding Monsieur Picot at home, went straight to the Minister of
      Public Instruction; and the minister flew to the Tuileries and saw the
      King; and the &lsquo;Messager&rsquo; came out this evening&mdash;strange to say, so
      early that I could read it in my carriage as I drove along&mdash;with an
      announcement that Monsieur Picot is named Chevalier of the Legion of
      honor, with a pension of eighteen hundred francs from the fund devoted to
      the encouragement of science and letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one cross at least well bestowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But eighteen hundred francs for the pension seems to me rather paltry,&rdquo;
       said Dutocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;and all the more because that money comes
      from the tax-payers; and, when one sees the taxes, as we do, frittered
      away on court favorites&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen hundred francs a year,&rdquo; interrupted Minard, &ldquo;is certainly
      something, especially for savants, a class of people who are accustomed to
      live on very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that this very Monsieur Picot
      leads a strange life, and that his family, who at first wanted to shut him
      up as a lunatic, are now trying to have guardians appointed over him. They
      say he allows a servant-woman who keeps his house to rob him of all he
      has. Parbleu! Thuillier, you know her; it is that woman who came to the
      office the other day about some money in Dupuis&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, true,&rdquo; said Thuillier, significantly; &ldquo;you are right, I do know
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is queer,&rdquo; said Brigitte, seeing a chance to enforce the argument she
      had used to Celeste, &ldquo;that all these learned men are good for nothing
      outside of their science; in their homes they have to be treated like
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That proves,&rdquo; said the Abbe Gondrin, &ldquo;the great absorption which their
      studies give to their minds, and, at the same time, a simplicity of nature
      which is very touching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they are not as obstinate as mules,&rdquo; said Brigitte, hastily. &ldquo;For
      myself, monsieur l&rsquo;abbe, I must say that if I had had any idea of
      marriage, a savant wouldn&rsquo;t have suited me at all. What do they do, these
      savants, anyhow? Useless things most of the time. You are all admiring one
      who has discovered a star; but as long as we are in this world what good
      is that to us? For all the use we make of stars it seems to me we have got
      enough of them as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Brigitte!&rdquo; said Colleville, getting loose again; &ldquo;you are right,
      my girl, and I think, as you do, that the man who discovers a new dish
      deserves better of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colleville,&rdquo; said Flavie, &ldquo;I must say that your style of behavior is in
      the worst taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; said the Abbe Gondrin, addressing Brigitte, &ldquo;you might be
      right if we were formed of matter only; and if, bound to our body, there
      were not a soul with instincts and appetites that must be satisfied. Well,
      I think that this sense of the infinite which is within us, and which we
      all try to satisfy each in our own way, is marvellously well helped by the
      labors of astronomy, that reveal to us from time to time new worlds which
      the hand of the Creator has put into space. The infinite in you has taken
      another course; this passion for the comfort of those about you, this
      warm, devoted, ardent affection which you feel for your brother, are
      equally the manifestation of aspirations which have nothing material about
      them, and which, in seeking their end and object, never think of asking,
      &lsquo;What good does that do? what is the use of this?&rsquo; Besides, I must assure
      you that the stars are not as useless as you seem to think. Without them
      how would navigators cross the sea? They would be puzzled to get you the
      vanilla with which you have flavored the delicious cream I am now eating.
      So, as Monsieur Colleville has perceived, there is more affinity than you
      think between a dish and a star; no one should be despised,&mdash;neither
      an astronomer nor a good housekeeper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abbe was here interrupted by the noise of a lively altercation in the
      antechamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that I will go in,&rdquo; said a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, you shall not go in,&rdquo; said another voice, that of the
      man-servant. &ldquo;The company are at table, I tell you, and nobody has the
      right to force himself in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier turned pale; ever since the seizure of his pamphlet, he fancied
      all sudden arrivals meant the coming of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the various social rules imparted to Brigitte by Madame de Godollo,
      the one that most needed repeating was the injunction never, as mistress
      of the house, to rise from the table until she gave the signal for
      retiring. But present circumstances appeared to warrant the infraction of
      the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see what it is,&rdquo; she said to Thuillier, whose anxiety she
      noticed at once. &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; she said to the servant as
      soon as she reached the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman who wants to come in, and says that no one is ever
      dining at eight o&rsquo;clock at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are you, monsieur?&rdquo; said Brigitte, addressing an old man very
      oddly dressed, whose eyes were protected by a green shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I am neither a beggar nor a vagabond,&rdquo; replied the old man, in
      stentorian tones; &ldquo;my name is Picot, professor of mathematics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue du Val-de-Grace?&rdquo; asked Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&mdash;No. 9, next to the print-shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, monsieur, come in; we shall be only too happy to receive you,&rdquo;
       cried Thuillier, who, on hearing the name, had hurried out to meet the
      savant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hein! you scamp,&rdquo; said the learned man, turning upon the man-servant, who
      had retired, seeing that the matter was being settled amicably, &ldquo;I told
      you I should get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pere Picot was a tall old man, with an angular, stern face, who, despite
      the corrective of a blond wig with heavy curls, and that of the pacific
      green shade we have already mentioned, expressed on his large features,
      upon which the fury of study had produced a surface of leaden pallor, a
      snappish and quarrelsome disposition. Of this he had already given proof
      before entering the dining-room, where every one now rose to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His costume consisted of a huge frock-coat, something between a paletot
      and a dressing-gown, between which an immense waistcoat of iron-gray
      cloth, fastened from the throat to the pit of the stomach with two rows of
      buttons, hussar fashion, formed a sort of buckler. The trousers, though
      October was nearing its close, were made of black lasting, and gave
      testimony to long service by the projection of a darn on the otherwise
      polished surface covering the knees, the polish being produced by the
      rubbing of the hands upon those parts. But, in broad daylight, the feature
      of the old savant&rsquo;s appearance which struck the eye most vividly was a
      pair of Patagonian feet, imprisoned in slippers of beaver cloth, the
      which, moulded upon the mountainous elevations of gigantic bunions, made
      the spectator think, involuntarily, of the back of a dromedary or an
      advanced case of elephantiasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once installed in a chair which was hastily brought for him, and the
      company having returned to their places at table, the old man suddenly
      burst out in thundering tones, amid the silence created by curiosity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he,&mdash;that rogue, that scamp? Let him show himself; let him
      dare to speak to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it that offends you, my dear monsieur?&rdquo; said Thuillier, in
      conciliating accents, in which there was a slight tone of patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scamp whom I couldn&rsquo;t find in his own home, and they told me he was
      here, in this house. I&rsquo;m in the apartment, I think, of Monsieur Thuillier
      of the Council-general, place de la Madeleine, first story above the
      entresol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;and allow me to add, monsieur, that you are
      surrounded with the respect and sympathy of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will doubtless permit me to add,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;that the mayor of
      the arrondissement adjoining that which you inhabit congratulates himself
      on being here in presence of Monsieur Picot,&mdash;<i>the</i> Monsieur
      Picot, no doubt, who has just immortalized his name by the discovery of a
      star!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the professor, elevating to a still higher pitch
      the stentorian diapason of his voice, &ldquo;I am Picot (Nepomucene), but I have
      not discovered a star; I don&rsquo;t concern myself with any such fiddle-faddle;
      besides, my eyes are very weak; and that insolent young fellow I have come
      here to find is making me ridiculous with such talk. I don&rsquo;t see him here;
      he is hiding himself, I know; he dares not look me in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this person who annoys you?&rdquo; asked several voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unnatural pupil of mine,&rdquo; replied the old mathematician; &ldquo;a scamp, but
      full of ideas; his name is Felix Phellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name was received, as may well be imagined, with amazement. Finding
      the situation amusing, Colleville and la Peyrade went off into fits of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh, fools!&rdquo; cried the irate old man, rising. &ldquo;Yes, come and laugh
      within reach of my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he brandished a thick stick with a white china handle, which he
      used to guide himself, thereby nearly knocking over a candelabrum on the
      dinner-table upon Madame Minard&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, monsieur,&rdquo; cried Brigitte, springing forward and
      seizing his arm. &ldquo;Monsieur Felix is not here. He will probably come later
      to a reception we are about to give; but at present he has not arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t begin early, your receptions,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;it is past
      eight o&rsquo;clock. Well, as Monsieur Felix is coming later, you must allow me
      to wait for him. I believe you were eating your dinners; don&rsquo;t let me
      disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went back peaceably to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you permit it, monsieur,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;we will continue, or, I
      should say, finish dinner, for we are now at the dessert. May I offer you
      anything,&mdash;a glass of champagne and a biscuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very willing, madame,&rdquo; replied the intruder. &ldquo;No one ever refuses
      champagne, and I am always ready to eat between my meals; but you dine
      very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A place was made for him at table between Colleville and Mademoiselle
      Minard, and the former made it his business to fill the glass of his new
      neighbor, before whom was placed a dish of small cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade in a cajoling tone, &ldquo;you saw how surprised we
      were to hear you complain of Monsieur Felix Phellion,&mdash;so amiable, so
      inoffensive a young man. What has he done to you, that you should feel so
      angry with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his mouth full of cakes, which he was engulfing in quantities that
      made Brigitte uneasy, the professor made a sign that he would soon answer;
      then, having mistaken his glass and swallowed the contents of
      Colleville&rsquo;s, he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask what that insolent young man had done to me? A rascally thing;
      and not the first, either. He knows that I cannot abide stars, having very
      good reason to hate them, as you shall hear: In 1807, being attached to
      the Bureau of Longitudes, I was part of the scientific expedition sent to
      Spain, under the direction of my friend and colleague, Jean-Baptiste Biot,
      to determine the arc of the terrestrial meridian from Barcelona to the
      Balearic isles. I was just in the act of observing a star (perhaps the
      very one my rascally pupil has discovered), when suddenly, war having
      broken out between France and Spain, the peasants, seeing me perched with
      a telescope on Monte Galazzo, took it into their heads that I was making
      signals to the enemy. A mob of savages broke my instruments, and talked of
      stringing me up. They were just going to do it, when the captain of a
      vessel took me prisoner and thrust me into the citadel of Belver, where I
      spent three years in the harshest captivity. Since them, as you may well
      believe, I loathe the whole celestial system; though I was, without
      knowing it, the first to observe the famous comet of 1811; but I should
      have taken care not to say a word about it if it had not been for Monsieur
      Flauguergues, who announced it. Like all my pupils, Phellion knows my
      aversion to stars, and he knew very well the worst trick he could play me
      would be to saddle one on my back; and that deputation that came to play
      the farce of congratulating me was mighty lucky not to find me at home,
      for if they had, I can assure those gentlemen of the Academy, they would
      have had a hot reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody present thought the old mathematician&rsquo;s monomania quite
      delightful, except la Peyrade, who now, in perceiving Felix Phellion&rsquo;s
      part in the affair, regretted deeply having caused the explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Monsieur Picot,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;if Felix Phellion is only guilty
      of attributing his discovery to you, it seems to me that his indiscreet
      behavior has resulted in a certain compensation to you: the cross of the
      Legion of honor, a pension, and the glory attached to your name are not to
      be despised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cross and the pension I take,&rdquo; said the old man, emptying his glass,
      which, to Brigitte&rsquo;s terror, he set down upon the table with a force that
      threatened to smash it. &ldquo;The government has owed them to me these twenty
      years; not for the discovery of stars,&mdash;things that I have always
      despised,&mdash;but for my famous &lsquo;Treatise on Differential Logarithms&rsquo; 
      (Kepler thought proper to call them monologarithms), which is a sequel to
      the tables of Napier; also for my &lsquo;Postulatum&rsquo; of Euclid, of which I was
      the first to discover the solution; but above all, for my &lsquo;Theory of
      Perpetual Motion,&rsquo;&mdash;four volumes in quarto with plates; Paris, 1825.
      You see, therefore, monsieur, that to give me glory is bringing water to
      the Seine. I had so little need of Monsieur Felix Phellion to make me a
      position in the scientific world that I turned him out of my house long
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t the first star,&rdquo; said Colleville, flippantly, &ldquo;that he
      dared to put upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did worse than that,&rdquo; roared the old man; &ldquo;he ruined my reputation, he
      tarnished my name. My &lsquo;Theory of Perpetual Motion,&rsquo; the printing of which
      cost me every penny I owned, though it ought to have been printed gratis
      at the Royal Printing-office, was calculated to make my fortune and render
      me immortal. Well, that miserable Felix prevented it. From time to time,
      pretending to bring messages from my editor, he would say, the young
      sycophant, &lsquo;Papa Picot, your book is selling finely; here&rsquo;s five hundred
      francs&mdash;two hundred francs&mdash;and once it was two thousand&mdash;which
      your publisher charged me to give you.&rsquo; This thing went on for years, and
      my publisher, who had the baseness to enter into the plot, would say to
      me, when I went to the shop: &lsquo;Yes, yes, it doesn&rsquo;t do badly, it <i>bubbles</i>,
      that book; we shall soon be at the end of this edition.&rsquo; I, who didn&rsquo;t
      suggest anything, I pocketed my money, and thought to myself: &lsquo;My book is
      liked, little by little its ideas are making their way; I may now expect,
      from day to day, that some great capitalist will come to me and propose to
      apply my system&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;of &lsquo;Absorption of Liquids&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Colleville, who had been
      steadily filling the old fellow&rsquo;s glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, my &lsquo;Theory of Perpetual Motion,&rsquo; 4 vols. in quarto with
      plates. But no! days, weeks went by and nobody came; so, thinking that my
      publisher did not put all the energy he should into the matter, I tried to
      sell the second edition to another man. It was that, monsieur, that
      enabled me to discover the whole plot, on which, as I said before, I
      turned that serpent out of my house. In six years only nine copies had
      been sold! Kept quiet in false security I had done nothing for the
      propagation of my book, which had been left to take care of itself; and
      thus it was that I, victim of black and wicked jealousy, was shamefully
      despoiled of the value of my labors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Minard, making himself the mouthpiece of the thoughts of the
      company, &ldquo;may we not see in that act a manner as ingenious as it was
      delicate to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give me alms! is that what you mean?&rdquo; interrupted the old man, with a
      roar that made Mademoiselle Minard jump in her chair; &ldquo;to humiliate me,
      dishonor me&mdash;me, his old professor! Am I in need of charity? Has
      Picot (Nepomucene), to whom his wife brought a dowry of one hundred
      thousand francs, ever stretched out his palm to any one? But in these days
      nothing is respected. Old fellows, as they call us, our religion and our
      good faith is taken advantage of so that these youths may say to the
      public: &lsquo;Old drivellers, don&rsquo;t you see now they are good for nothing? It
      needs <i>us</i>, the young generation, <i>us</i>, the moderns, <i>us</i>,
      Young France, to bring them up on a bottle.&rsquo; Young greenhorn! let me see
      <i>you</i> try to feed <i>me</i>! Old drivellers know more in their little
      finger than you in your whole brain, and you&rsquo;ll never be worth us, paltry
      little intriguer that you are! However, I know my day of vengeance will
      come; that young Phellion can&rsquo;t help ending badly; what he did to-day,
      reading a statement to the Academy, under my name, was forgery, forgery!
      and the law will send him to the galleys for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Colleville, &ldquo;forgery of a public star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte, who quaked for her glasses, and whose nerves were exacerbated by
      the monstrous consumption of cakes and wine, now gave the signal to return
      to the salon. Besides, she had heard the door-bell ring several times,
      announcing the arrival of guests for the evening. The question then was
      how to transplant the professor, and Colleville politely offered him his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must allow me to stay where I am. I am not
      dressed for a party, and besides, a strong light hurts my eyes. Moreover,
      I don&rsquo;t choose to give myself as a spectacle; it will be best that my
      interview with Felix Phellion should take place between &lsquo;four-eyes,&rsquo; as
      they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him alone, then,&rdquo; said Brigitte to Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one insisted,&mdash;the old man having, unconsciously, pretty nigh
      discrowned himself in the opinion of the company. But before leaving, the
      careful housewife removed everything that was at all fragile from his
      reach; then, by way of a slight attention, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send you some coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it, madame,&rdquo; responded pere Picot, &ldquo;and some cognac with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! parbleu! he takes everything,&rdquo; said Brigitte to the male domestic,
      and she told the latter to keep an eye on the old madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Brigitte returned to the salon she found that the Abbe Gondrin had
      become the centre of a great circle formed by nearly the whole company,
      and as she approached, she heard him say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank Heaven for bestowing upon me such a pleasure. I have never felt
      an emotion like that aroused by the scene we have just witnessed; even the
      rather burlesque form of this confidence, which was certainly very
      artless, for it was quite involuntary, only adds to the honor of the
      surprising generosity it revealed. Placed as I am by my ministry in the
      way of knowing of many charities, and often either the witness or
      intermediary of good actions, I think I never in my life have met with a
      more touching or a more ingenious devotion. To keep the left hand ignorant
      of what the right hand does is a great step in Christianity; but to go so
      far as to rob one&rsquo;s self of one&rsquo;s own fame to benefit another under such
      conditions is the gospel applied in its highest precepts; it is being more
      than a Sister of Charity; it is doing the work of an apostle of
      beneficence. How I should like to know that noble young man, and shake him
      by the hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her arm slipped through that of her godmother, Celeste was standing
      very near the priest, her ears intent upon his words, her arm pressing
      tighter and tighter that of Madame Thuillier, as the abbe analyzed the
      generous action of Felix Phellion, until at last she whispered under her
      breath:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, godmother, you hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To destroy the inevitable effect which this hearty praise would surely
      have on Celeste, Thuillier hastened to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, Monsieur l&rsquo;abbe, the young man of whom you speak so warmly
      is not altogether unknown to you. I have had occasion to tell you about
      him, and to regret that it was not possible to follow out certain plans
      which we once entertained for him; I allude to the very compromising
      independence he affects in his religious opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is that the young man?&rdquo; said the abbe; &ldquo;you surprise me much; I must
      say such an idea would never have crossed my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see him presently, Monsieur l&rsquo;abbe,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, joining in
      the conversation, &ldquo;and if you question him on certain grounds you will
      have no difficulty in discovering the ravages that a love of science can
      commit in the most gifted souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not see him,&rdquo; said the abbe, &ldquo;as my black gown would
      be out of place in the midst of the more earthly gaiety that will soon
      fill this salon. But I know, Monsieur de la Peyrade, that you are a man of
      sincerely pious convictions, and as, without any doubt, you feel as much
      interest in the young man&rsquo;s welfare as I do myself, I shall say to you in
      parting: Do not be uneasy about him; sooner or later, such choice souls
      come back to us, and if the return of these prodigals should be long
      delayed I should not fear, on seeing them go to God, that His infinite
      mercy would fail them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the abbe looked about to find his hat, and proceeded to slip
      quietly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a fearful uproar was heard. Rushing into the dining-room, whence
      came a sound of furniture overturned and glasses breaking, Brigitte found
      Colleville occupied in adjusting his cravat and looking himself over to be
      sure that his coat, cruelly pulled awry, bore no signs of being actually
      torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that old idiot,&rdquo; replied Colleville, &ldquo;who is in a fury. I came to
      take my coffee with him, just to keep him company, and he took a joke
      amiss, and collared me, and knocked over two chairs and a tray of glasses
      because Josephine didn&rsquo;t get out of his way in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all because you&rsquo;ve been teasing him,&rdquo; said Brigitte, crossly; &ldquo;why
      couldn&rsquo;t you stay in the salon instead of coming here to play your jokes,
      as you call them? You think you are still in the orchestra of the
      Opera-Comique.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sharp rebuke delivered, Brigitte, like the resolute woman that she
      was, saw that she absolutely must get rid of the ferocious old man who
      threatened her household with flames and blood. Accordingly, she
      approached pere Picot, who was tranquilly engaged in burning brandy in his
      saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, at the top of her lungs, as if she were speaking to
      a deaf person (evidently thinking that a blind one ought to be treated in
      the same manner), &ldquo;I have come to tell you something that may annoy you.
      Monsieur and Madame Phellion have just arrived, and they inform me that
      their son, Monsieur Felix, is not coming. He has a cold and a
      sore-throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he got it this afternoon reading that lecture,&rdquo; cried the professor,
      joyfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s justice!&mdash;Madame, where do you get your brandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at my grocer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Brigitte, taken aback by the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, I ought to tell you that in a house where one can drink
      such excellent champagne, which reminds me of that we used to quaff at the
      table of Monsieur de Fontanes, grand-master of the University, it is
      shameful to keep such brandy. I tell you, with the frankness I put into
      everything, that it is good only to wash your horses&rsquo; feet, and if I had
      not the resource of burning it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the devil in person,&rdquo; thought Brigitte; &ldquo;not a word of excuse about
      all that glass, but he must needs fall foul of my brandy too!&mdash;Monsieur,&rdquo;
       she resumed, in the same raised diapason, &ldquo;as Monsieur Felix is not
      coming, don&rsquo;t you think your family will be uneasy at your absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Family? I haven&rsquo;t any, madame, owing to the fact that they want to make
      me out a lunatic. But I have a housekeeper, Madame Lambert, and I dare say
      she will be surprised not to see me home by this time. I think I had
      better go now; if I stay later, the scene might be more violent. But I
      must own that in this strange quarter I am not sure if I can find my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take a carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carriage here, carriage there, indeed! my spiteful relations wouldn&rsquo;t
      lose the chance of calling me a spendthrift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an important message to send into your quarter,&rdquo; said Brigitte,
      seeing she must resolve to make the sacrifice, &ldquo;and I have just told my
      porter to take a cab and attend to it. If you would like to take advantage
      of that convenience&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept it, madame,&rdquo; said the old professor, rising; &ldquo;and, if it comes
      to the worst, I hope you will testify before the judge that I was
      niggardly about a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henri,&rdquo; said Brigitte to the man-servant, &ldquo;take monsieur down to the
      porter and tell him to do the errand I told him about just now, and to
      take monsieur to his own door, and be very careful of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful of him!&rdquo; echoed the old man. &ldquo;Do you take me for a trunk, madame,
      or a bit of cracked china?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she had got her man fairly to the door, Brigitte allowed
      herself to turn upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say, monsieur, is for your good. You must allow me to observe that
      you have not an agreeable nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful of him! careful of him!&rdquo; repeated the old man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,
      madame, that by the use of such words you may get people put into lunatic
      asylums? However, I will not reply rudely to the polite hospitality I have
      received,&mdash;all the more because, I think, I have put Monsieur Felix,
      who missed me intentionally, in his right place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go, go, you old brute!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, slamming the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before returning to the salon she was obliged to drink a whole glassful of
      water, the restraint she had been forced to put upon herself in order to
      get rid of this troublesome guest having, to use her own expression, &ldquo;put
      her all about.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. THE MAN WHO THINKS THE STAR TOO BRIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Minard paid a visit to Phellion in his study. The great
      citizen and his son Felix were at that moment engaged in a conversation
      which seemed to have some unusual interest for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Felix,&rdquo; cried the mayor of the eleventh arrondissement, offering
      his hand warmly to the young professor, &ldquo;it is you who bring me here this
      morning; I have come to offer you my congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has occurred?&rdquo; asked Phellion. &ldquo;Have the Thuilliers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has nothing to do with the Thuilliers,&rdquo; interrupted the mayor. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
       he added, looking hard at Felix, &ldquo;can that sly fellow have concealed the
      thing even from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;that ever, in his life, has my son
      concealed a thing from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know about the sublime astronomical discovery which he
      communicated to the Academy of Sciences yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your kindness for me, Monsieur le maire,&rdquo; said Felix, hastily, &ldquo;has led
      you astray; I was only the reader of the communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! let me alone!&rdquo; said Minard; &ldquo;reader, indeed! I know all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But see,&rdquo; said Felix, offering Minard the &ldquo;Constitutionnel,&rdquo; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the
      paper; not only does it announce that Monsieur Picot is the maker of the
      discovery, but it mentions the rewards which, without losing a moment, the
      government has bestowed upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix is right,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;that journal is to be trusted. On this
      occasion I think the government has acted very properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear commander, I repeat to you that the truth of the affair has
      got wind, and your son is shown to be a most admirable fellow. To put his
      own discovery to the credit of his old professor so as to obtain for him
      the recognition and favor of the authorities&mdash;upon my word, in all
      antiquity I don&rsquo;t know a finer trait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix!&rdquo; said Phellion, beginning to show some emotion, &ldquo;these immense
      labors to which you have devoted so much time of late, these continual
      visits to the Observatory&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; interrupted Felix, &ldquo;Monsieur Minard has been misinformed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misinformed!&rdquo; cried Minard, &ldquo;when I know the whole affair from Monsieur
      Picot himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this argument, stated in a way to leave no possible doubt, the truth
      began to dawn upon Phellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, my son!&rdquo; he said, rising to embrace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was obliged to sit down again; his legs refused to bear his weight;
      he turned pale; and that nature, ordinarily so impassible, seemed about to
      give way under the shock of this happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Felix, terrified, &ldquo;he is ill; ring the bell, I entreat you,
      Monsieur Minard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he ran to the old man, loosened his cravat and unfastened the collar
      of his shirt, striking him in the palms of his hands. But the sudden
      faintness was but momentary; almost immediately himself again, Phellion
      gathered his son to his heart, and holding him long in his embrace, he
      said, in a voice broken by the tears that came to put an end to this shock
      of joy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix, my noble son! so great in heart, so great in mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell had been rung by Minard with magisterial force, and with such an
      accent that the whole household was alarmed, and came running in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing, it is nothing,&rdquo; said Phellion to the servants, sending
      them away. But almost at the same moment, seeing his wife, who now entered
      the room, he resumed his habitual solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Phellion,&rdquo; he said, pointing to Felix, &ldquo;how many years is it since
      you brought that young man into the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Phellion, bewildered by the question, hesitated a moment, and then
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five years next January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not thought, until now, that God had amply granted your maternal
      desires by making this child of your womb an honest man, a pious son, and
      by gifting him for mathematics, that Science of sciences, with an aptitude
      sufficiently remarkable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, understanding less and less what her
      husband was coming to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Phellion, &ldquo;you owe to God an additional thanksgiving,
      for He has granted that you be the mother of a man of genius; his toil,
      which lately we rebuked, and which made us fear for the reason of our
      child, was the way&mdash;the rough and jagged way&mdash;by which men come
      to fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; cried Madame Phellion, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you stop coming yourself to an
      explanation of what you mean, and get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; said Minard, cautious this time in measuring the joy he was
      about to bestow, fearing another fainting-fit of happiness, &ldquo;has just made
      a very important scientific discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, going up to Felix, and taking him by
      both hands as she looked at him lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I say important,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;I am only sparing your maternal
      emotions; it is, in truth, a sublime, a dazzling discovery. He is only
      twenty-five years old, but his name, from henceforth, is immortal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the man,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, half beside herself, and
      kissing Felix with effusion, &ldquo;to whom that la Peyrade is preferred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not preferred, madame,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;for the Thuilliers are not the
      dupes of that adventurer. But he has made himself necessary to them.
      Thuillier fancies that without la Peyrade he could not be elected; the
      election is still doubtful, and they are sacrificing everything to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it odious,&rdquo; cried Madame Phellion, &ldquo;to consider such interests
      before the happiness of their child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;but Celeste is not their child, only their adopted
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brigitte&rsquo;s, if you like,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion; &ldquo;but as for Thuillier&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good wife,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;no censoriousness. The good God has just
      sent us a great consolation; and, indeed, though certainly far advanced,
      this marriage, about which I regret to say Felix does not behave with all
      the philosophy I could desire, may still not take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Felix shook his head with a look of incredulity, Minard
      hastened to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, the commander is quite right. Last night there was a hitch
      about signing the contract, and it was not signed. You were not there, by
      the bye, and your absence was much remarked upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were invited,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;and up to the last moment we hesitated
      whether to go or not. But, as you will readily see, our position was a
      false one; besides, Felix&mdash;and I see now it must have been in
      consequence of his lecture at the Academy&mdash;was completely worn out
      with fatigue and emotion. To present ourselves without him would have
      seemed very singular; therefore we decided that it would be wisest and
      best to absent ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the man whom he had just declared immortal did not deter
      Minard, when the occasion was thus made for him, from plunging eagerly
      into one of the most precious joys of bourgeois existence, namely, the
      retailing of gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just imagine!&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;last night at the Thuilliers&rsquo; the most
      extraordinary things took place, one after another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First he related the curious episode of pere Picot. Then he told of the
      hearty approbation given to Felix&rsquo;s conduct by the Abbe Gondrin, and the
      desire the young preacher had expressed to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see him,&rdquo; said Felix; &ldquo;do you know where he lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue de la Madeleine, No. 8,&rdquo; replied Minard. &ldquo;But the great event of the
      evening was the spectacle of that fine company assembled to listen to the
      marriage-contract, and waiting in expectation a whole hour for the notary,
      who&mdash;never came!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the contract is not signed?&rdquo; said Felix, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even read, my friend. Suddenly some one came in and told Brigitte
      that the notary had started for Brussels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! no doubt,&rdquo; said Phellion, naively; &ldquo;some very important business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most important,&rdquo; replied Minard; &ldquo;a little bankruptcy of five hundred
      thousand francs which the gentleman leaves behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is this public officer,&rdquo; demanded Phellion, &ldquo;so recreant, in this
      scandalous manner, to the sacred duties of his calling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! your neighbor in the rue Saint-Jacques, the notary Dupuis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, &ldquo;that pious man? Why, he is churchwarden of
      the parish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! madame, those are the very ones,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;to run off&mdash;there
      are many precedents for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;such news cast suddenly among the company must have
      fallen like a thunderbolt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;as it was brought in the most unexpected and
      singular manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us all about it,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion, with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;that this canting swindler had charge
      of the savings of a number of servants, and that Monsieur de la Peyrade&mdash;because,
      you see, they are all of a clique, these pious people&mdash;was in the
      habit of recruiting clients for him in that walk of life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always said so!&rdquo; interrupted Madame Phellion. &ldquo;I knew that Provencal
      was no good at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; continued the mayor, &ldquo;that he had placed in Dupuis&rsquo;s hands all
      the savings of an old housekeeper, pious herself, amounting to a pretty
      little sum. Faith! I think myself it was worth some trouble. How much do
      you suppose it was? Twenty-five thousand francs, if you please! This
      housekeeper, whose name is Madame Lambert&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Lambert!&rdquo; cried Felix; &ldquo;why, that&rsquo;s Monsieur Picot&rsquo;s housekeeper;
      close cap, pale, thin face, speaks always with her eyes lowered, shows no
      hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s she,&rdquo; said Minard,&mdash;&ldquo;a regular hypocrite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five thousand francs of savings!&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that
      poor pere Picot is always out of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that someone had to meddle with the sale of his book,&rdquo; said Minard,
      slyly. &ldquo;However that may be, you can imagine that the woman was in a fine
      state of mind on hearing of the flight of the notary. Off she went to la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s lodgings; there she was told he was dining at the Thuilliers&rsquo;;
      to the Thuilliers&rsquo; she came, after running about the streets&mdash;for
      they didn&rsquo;t give her quite the right address&mdash;till ten o&rsquo;clock; but
      she got there while the company were still sitting round waiting for the
      notary, and gaping at each other, no one knowing what to say and do, for
      neither Brigitte nor Thuillier have faculty enough to get out of such a
      scrape with credit; and we all missed the voice of Madame de Godollo and
      the talent of Madame Phellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are too polite, Monsieur le maire,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion,
      bridling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I said,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;at ten o&rsquo;clock Madame Lambert
      reached the antechamber of Monsieur the general-councillor, and there she
      asked, in great excitement, to see la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was natural,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;he being the intermediary of the
      investment, this woman had a right to question him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should just have seen that Tartuffe!&rdquo; continued Minard. &ldquo;He had no
      sooner gone out than he returned, bringing the news. As everybody was
      longing to get away, there followed a general helter-skelter. And then
      what does our man do? He goes back to Madame Lambert, who was crying that
      she was ruined! she was lost!&mdash;which might very well be true, but it
      might also be only a scene arranged between them in presence of the
      company, whom the woman&rsquo;s outcries detained in the antechamber. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      anxious, my good woman,&rsquo; said la Peyrade; &lsquo;the investment was made at your
      request, consequently, I owe you nothing; BUT it is enough that the money
      passed through my hands to make my conscience tell me I am responsible. If
      the notary&rsquo;s assets are not enough to pay you I will do so.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;that was my idea as you told it; the intermediary
      is or ought to be responsible. I should not have hesitated to do as
      Monsieur de la Peyrade did, and I do not think that after such conduct as
      that he ought to be taxed with Jesuitism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you would have done so,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;and so should I, but we
      shouldn&rsquo;t have done it with a brass band; we should have paid our money
      quietly, like gentlemen. But this electoral manager, how is he going to
      pay it? Out of the &lsquo;dot&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the little page entered the room and gave a letter to Felix
      Phellion. It came from pere Picot, and was written at his dictation by
      Madame Lambert, for which reason we will not reproduce the orthography.
      The writing of Madame Lambert was of those that can never be forgotten
      when once seen. Recognizing it instantly, Felix hastened to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from the professor&rdquo;; then, before breaking the seal, he added,
      &ldquo;Will you permit me, Monsieur le maire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll rate you finely,&rdquo; said Minard, laughing. &ldquo;I never saw anything so
      comical as his wrath last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix, as he read the letter, smiled to himself. When he had finished it,
      he passed it to his father, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it aloud if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, with his solemn voice and manner, Phellion read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My dear Felix,&mdash;I have just received your note; it came in the
  nick of time, for I was, as they say, in a fury with you. You tell
  me that you were guilty of that abuse of confidence (about which I
  intended to write you a piece of my mind) in order to give a
  knock-down blow to my relations by proving that a man capable of
  making such complicated calculations as your discovery required
  was not a man to put in a lunatic asylum or drag before a
  judiciary council. That argument pleases me, and it makes such a
  good answer to the infamous proceedings of my relations that I
  praise you for having had the idea. But you sold it to me, that
  argument, pretty dear when you put me in company with a star, for
  you know very well <i>that</i> propinquity wouldn&rsquo;t please me at all. It
  is not at my age, and after solving the great problem of perpetual
  motion, that a man could take up with such rubbish as that,&mdash;good
  only for boys and greenhorns like you; and that is what I have
  taken the liberty this morning to go and tell the minister of
  public instruction, by whom I must say I was received with the
  most perfect urbanity. I asked him to see whether, as he had made
  a mistake and sent them to the wrong address, he could not take
  back his cross and his pension,&mdash;though to be sure, as I told him,
  I deserved them for other things.

  &ldquo;The government,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is not in the habit of making
  mistakes; what it does is always properly done, and it never
  annuls an ordinance signed by the hand of his Majesty. Your great
  labors have deserved the two favors the King has granted you; it
  is a long-standing debt, which I am happy to pay off in his name.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;But Felix?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;because after all for a young man it is not
  such a bad discovery.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Monsieur Felix Phellion,&rdquo; replied the minister, &ldquo;will receive in
  the course of the day his appointment to the rank of Chevalier of
  the Legion of honor; I will have it signed this morning by the
  king. Moreover, there is a vacant place at the Academy of
  Sciences, and if you are not a candidate for it&mdash;&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;I, in the Academy!&rdquo; I interrupted, with the frankness of speech
  you know I always use; &ldquo;I execrate academies; they are stiflers,
  extinguishers, assemblages of sloths, idlers, shops with big signs
  and nothing to sell inside&mdash;&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the minister, smiling, &ldquo;I think that at the
  next election Monsieur Felix Phellion will have every chance, and
  among those chances I count the influence of the government which
  is secured to him.&rdquo;
 
  There, my poor boy, is all that I have been able to do to reward
  your good intentions and to prove to you that I am no longer
  angry. I think the relations are going to pull a long face. Come
  and talk about it to-day at four o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t dine after
  bedtime, as I saw some people doing last night in a house where I
  had occasion to mention your talents in a manner that was very
  advantageous to you. Madame Lambert, who does better with a
  saucepan than with pen and ink, shall distinguish herself, though
  it is Friday, and she never lets me off a fast day. But she has
  promised us a fish dinner worthy of an archbishop, with a fine
  half-bottle of champagne (doubled if need be) to wash it down.
</pre>
    <p>
      Your old professor and friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Picot (Nepomucene),
    </p>
    <p>
      Chevalier of the Legion of honor.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  P.S.&mdash;Do you think you could obtain from your respectable mother a
  little flask of that old and excellent cognac you once gave me?
  Not a drop remains, and yesterday I was forced to drink some stuff
  only fit to bathe horses&rsquo; feet, as I did not hesitate to say to
  the beautiful Hebe who served it to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he shall have some,&rdquo; said Madame Phellion; &ldquo;not a flask, but a
      gallon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;who pique myself on mine, which didn&rsquo;t come from
      Brigitte&rsquo;s grocer either, I&rsquo;ll send him several bottles; but don&rsquo;t tell
      him who sent them, Monsieur le chevalier, for you never can tell how that
      singular being will take things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said Phellion, suddenly, &ldquo;get me my black coat and a white
      cravat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Madame Phellion. &ldquo;To the minister, to thank
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me, I say, those articles of habiliment. I have an important visit
      to make; and Monsieur le maire will, I know, excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself must be off,&rdquo; said Minard. &ldquo;I, too, have important business,
      though it isn&rsquo;t about a star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Questioned in vain by Felix and his wife, Phellion completed his attire
      with a pair of white gloves, sent for a carriage, and, at the end of half
      an hour, entered the presence of Brigitte, whom he found presiding over
      the careful putting away of the china, glass, and silver which had
      performed their several functions the night before. Leaving these
      housekeeping details, she received her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa Phellion,&rdquo; she said, when they were both seated in the salon,
      &ldquo;you broke your word yesterday; you were luckier than the rest. Do you
      know what a trick that notary played us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;and it is the check thus unexpectedly given
      to the execution of your plans that I shall take for the text of an
      important conversation which I desire to have with you. Sometimes
      Providence would seem to take pleasure in counteracting our best-laid
      schemes; sometimes, also, by means of the obstacles it raises in our path,
      it seems to intend to indicate that we are bearing too far to the right or
      to the left, and should pause to reflect upon our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providence!&rdquo; said Brigitte the strong-minded,&mdash;&ldquo;Providence has
      something else to do than to look after us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one opinion,&rdquo; said Phellion; &ldquo;but I myself am accustomed to see
      its decrees in the little as well as the great things of life; and
      certainly, if it had allowed the fulfilment of your engagements with
      Monsieur de la Peyrade to be even partially begun yesterday, you would not
      have seen me here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;do you think that by default of a notary the
      marriage will not take place? They do say that for want of a monk the
      abbey won&rsquo;t come to a standstill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; said the great citizen, &ldquo;you will do me the justice to feel
      that neither I, nor my wife, have ever attempted to influence your
      decision; we have allowed our young people to love each other without much
      consideration as to where that attachment would lead&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It led to upsetting their minds,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what love is,
      and that&rsquo;s why I deprived myself of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is, indeed, true of my unfortunate son,&rdquo; resumed Phellion;
      &ldquo;for, notwithstanding the noble distractions he has endeavored to give to
      his sorrow, he is to-day so miserably overcome by it that this morning, in
      spite of the glorious success he has just obtained, he was speaking to me
      of undertaking a voyage of circumnavigation around the globe,&mdash;a rash
      enterprise which would detain him from his native land at least three
      years, if, indeed, he escaped the dangers of so prolonged a journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a bad idea; he&rsquo;ll return consoled, having
      discovered three or four more new stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His present discovery suffices,&rdquo; said Phellion, with double his ordinary
      gravity, &ldquo;and it is under the auspices of that triumph, which has placed
      his name at so great a height in the scientific world, that I have the
      assurance to say to you, point-blank: Mademoiselle, I have come to ask
      you, on behalf of my son, who loves as he is beloved, for the hand in
      marriage of Mademoiselle Celeste Colleville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear man,&rdquo; replied Brigitte, &ldquo;it is too late; remember that we
      are <i>diametrically</i> engaged to la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is never, they say, too late to do well, and yesterday it would have
      been in my judgment too early. My son, having to offer an equivalent for a
      fortune, could not say to you until to-day: &lsquo;Though Celeste, by your
      generosity has a &ldquo;dot&rdquo; which mine is far from equalling, yet I have the
      honor to be a member of the Royal order of the Legion of honor, and
      shortly, according to appearance, I shall be a member of the Royal Academy
      of Sciences, one of the five branches of the Institute.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;Felix is getting to be a very pretty match,
      but we have passed our word to la Peyrade; the banns are published at the
      mayor&rsquo;s office, and unless something extraordinary happens the contract
      will be signed. La Peyrade is very busy about Thuillier&rsquo;s election, which
      he has now got into good shape; we have capital engaged with him in the
      affair of this newspaper; and it would be impossible to go back on our
      promise, even if we wished to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;in one of the rare occasions of life when reason and
      inclination blend together, you think you must be guided solely by the
      question of material interests. Celeste, as we know, has no inclination
      for Monsieur de la Peyrade. Brought up with Felix&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought up with Felix!&rdquo; interrupted Brigitte. &ldquo;She was given a period of
      time to choose between Monsieur de la Peyrade and your son,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      how we coerce her, if you please,&mdash;and she would not take Monsieur
      Felix, whose atheism is too well known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, mademoiselle, my son is not an atheist; for Voltaire
      himself doubted if there could be atheists; and no later than yesterday,
      in this house, an ecclesiastic, as admirable for his talents as for his
      virtues, after making a magnificent eulogy of my son, expressed the desire
      to know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! yes, to convert him,&rdquo; said Brigitte. &ldquo;But as for this marriage,
      I am sorry to tell you that the mustard is made too late for the dinner;
      Thuillier will never renounce his la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Phellion, rising, &ldquo;I feel no humiliation for the
      useless step I have this day taken; I do not even ask you to keep it
      secret, for I shall myself mention it to our friends and acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it to whom you like, my good man,&rdquo; replied Brigitte, acrimoniously.
      &ldquo;Because your son has discovered a star,&mdash;if, indeed, he did discover
      it, and not that old fool the government decorated&mdash;do you expect him
      to marry a daughter of the King of the French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Phellion, &ldquo;we will say no more. I might answer that,
      without depreciating the Thuilliers, the Orleans family seems to me more
      distinguished; but I do not like to introduce acerbity into the
      conversation, and therefore, begging you to receive the assurance of my
      humble respects, I retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he made his exit majestically, and left Brigitte with the arrow
      of his comparison, discharged after the manner of the Parthian &ldquo;in
      extremis,&rdquo; sticking in her mind, and she herself in a temper all the more
      savage because already, the evening before, Madame Thuillier, after the
      guests were gone, had the incredible audacity to say something in favor of
      Felix. Needless to relate that the poor helot was roughly put down and
      told to mind her own business. But this attempt at a will of her own in
      her sister-in-law had already put the old maid in a vile humor, and
      Phellion, coming to reopen the subject, exasperated her. Josephine, the
      cook, and the &ldquo;male domestic,&rdquo; received the after-clap of the scene which
      had just taken place. Brigitte found that in her absence everything had
      been done wrong, and putting her own hand to the work, she hoisted herself
      on a chair, at the risk of her neck, to reach the upper shelves of the
      closet, where her choicest china, for gala days, was carefully kept under
      lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day, which for Brigitte began so ill, was, beyond all gainsaying, one
      of the stormiest and most portentous of this narrative.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A STORMY DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      As an exact historian, we must go back and begin the day at six in the
      morning, when we can see Madame Thuillier going to the Madeleine to hear
      the mass that the Abbe Gondrin was in the habit of saying at that hour,
      and afterwards approaching the holy table,&mdash;a viaticum which pious
      souls never fail to give themselves when it is in their minds to
      accomplish some great resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      About mid-day the abbe received a visit in his own home from Madame
      Thuillier and Celeste. The poor child wanted a little development of the
      words by which the priest had given security, the evening before, in
      Brigitte&rsquo;s salon, for the eternal welfare of Felix Phellion. It seemed
      strange to the mind of this girl-theologian that, without practising
      religion, a soul could be received into grace by the divine justice; for
      surely the anathema is clear: Out of the Church there is no salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said the Abbe Gondrin, &ldquo;learn to understand that saying
      which seems to you so inexplicable. It is more a saying of thanksgiving
      for those who have the happiness to live within the pale of our holy
      mother the Church than a malediction upon those who have the misfortune to
      live apart from her. God sees to the depths of all hearts; He knows His
      elect; and so great is the treasure of His goodness that to none is it
      given to limit its riches and its munificence. Who shall dare to say to
      God: Thou wilt be generous and munificent so far and no farther. Jesus
      Christ forgave the woman in adultery, and on the cross He promised heaven
      to a thief, in order to prove to us that He deals with men, not according
      to human sentiments, but according to <i>his</i> wisdom and <i>his</i>
      mercy. He who thinks himself a Christian may be in the eyes of God an
      idolator; and another who is thought a pagan may, by his feelings and his
      actions be, without his own knowledge, a Christian. Our holy religion has
      this that is divine about it; all grandeur, all heroism are but the
      practice of its precepts. I was saying yesterday to Monsieur de la Peyrade
      that pure souls must be, in course of time, its inevitable conquest. It is
      all-important to give them their just credit; that is a confidence which
      returns great dividends; and, besides, charity commands it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my God!&rdquo; cried Celeste, &ldquo;to learn that too late! I, who could have
      chosen between Felix and Monsieur de la Peyrade, and did not dare to
      follow the ideas of my heart! Oh! Monsieur l&rsquo;abbe, couldn&rsquo;t you speak to
      my mother? Your advice is always listened to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, my dear child,&rdquo; replied the vicar. &ldquo;If I had the direction of
      Madame Colleville&rsquo;s conscience I might perhaps say a word, but we are so
      often accused of meddling imprudently in family matters! Be sure that my
      intervention here, without authority or right, would do you more harm than
      good. It is for you and for those who love you,&rdquo; he added, giving a look
      to Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;to see if these arrangements, already so far
      advanced, could be changed in the direction of your wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was written that the poor child was to drink to the dregs the cup she
      had herself prepared by her intolerance. As the abbe finished speaking,
      his housekeeper came in to ask if he would receive Monsieur Felix
      Phellion. Thus, like the Charter of 1830, Madame de Godollo&rsquo;s officious
      falsehood was turned into truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go this way,&rdquo; he said hastily, showing his two penitents out by a private
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life has such strange encounters that it does sometimes happen that the
      same form of proceeding must be used by courtesans and by the men of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;abbe,&rdquo; said Felix to the young vicar as soon as they met, &ldquo;I
      have heard of the kind manner in which you were so very good as to speak
      of me in Monsieur Thuillier&rsquo;s salon last night, and I should have hastened
      to express my gratitude if another interest had not drawn me to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Gondrin passed hastily over the compliments, eager to know in
      what way he could be useful to his fellow-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an intention that I wish to think kindly,&rdquo; replied Felix, &ldquo;you were
      spoken to yesterday about the state of my soul. Those who read it so
      fluently know more than I do about my inner being, for, during the last
      few days I have felt strange, inexplicable feelings within me. Never have
      I doubted God, but, in contact with that infinitude where he has permitted
      my thought to follow the traces of his work I seem to have gathered a
      sense of him less vague, more immediate; and this has led me to ask myself
      whether an honest and upright life is the only homage which his
      omnipotence expects of me. Nevertheless, there are numberless objections
      rising in my mind against the worship of which you are the minister; while
      sensible of the beauty of its external form in many of its precepts and
      practices, I find myself deterred by my reason. I shall have paid dearly,
      perhaps by the happiness of my whole life, for the slowness and want of
      vigor which I have shown in seeking the solution of my doubts. I have now
      decided to search to the bottom of them. No one so well as you, Monsieur
      l&rsquo;abbe, can help me to solve them. I have come with confidence to lay them
      before you, to ask you to listen to me, to answer me, and to tell me by
      what studies I can pursue the search for light. It is a cruelly afflicted
      soul that appeals to you. Is not that a good ground for the seed of your
      word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Gondrin eagerly protested the joy with which, notwithstanding his
      own insufficiency, he would undertake to reply to the scruples of
      conscience in the young savant. After asking him for a place in his
      friendship, and telling him to come at certain hours for conversation, he
      asked him to read, as a first step, the &ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo; of Pascal. A natural
      affinity, on the side of science, would, he believed, be established
      between the spirit of Pascal and that of the young mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this scene was passing, a scene to which the greatness of the
      interests in question and the moral and intellectual elevation of the
      personages concerned in it gave a character of grandeur which, like all
      reposeful, tranquil aspects, is easier far to comprehend than to
      reproduce, another scene, of sharp and bitter discord, that chronic malady
      of bourgeois households, where the pettiness of minds and passions gives
      open way to it, was taking place in the Thuillier home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounted upon her chair, her hair in disorder and her face and fingers
      dirty, Brigitte, duster in hand, was cleaning the shelves of the closet,
      where she was replacing her library of plates, dishes, and sauce-boats,
      when Flavie came in and accosted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brigitte,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you have finished what you are about you had
      better come down to our apartment, or else I&rsquo;ll send Celeste to you; she
      seems to me to be inclined to make trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Brigitte, continuing to dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she and Madame Thuillier went to see the Abbe Gondrin this
      morning, and she has been attacking me about Felix Phellion, and talks of
      him as if he were a god; from that to refusing to marry la Peyrade is but
      a step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those cursed skull-caps!&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;they meddle in everything! I
      didn&rsquo;t want to invite him, but you would insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flavie, &ldquo;it was proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proper! I despise proprieties!&rdquo; cried the old maid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a maker of
      speeches; he said nothing last night that wasn&rsquo;t objectionable. Send
      Celeste to me; I&rsquo;ll settle her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a servant announced to Brigitte the arrival of a clerk
      from the office of the new notary chosen, in default of Dupuis, to draw up
      the contract. Without considering her disorderly appearance, Brigitte
      ordered him to be shown in, but she made him the condescension of
      descending from her perch instead of talking from the height of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Thuillier,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;came to our office this morning to
      explain to the master the clauses of the contract he has been so good as
      to entrust to us. But before writing down the stipulations, we are in the
      habit of obtaining from the lips of each donor a direct expression of his
      or her intentions. In accordance with this rule, Monsieur Thuillier told
      us that he gives to the bride the reversion, at his death, of the house he
      inhabits, which I presume to be this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;that is the understanding. As for me, I give three
      hundred thousand francs a year in the Three-per-cents, capital and
      interest; but the bride is married under the dotal system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said the clerk, consulting his notes. &ldquo;Mademoiselle
      Brigitte, three thousand francs a year. Now, there is Madame Celeste
      Thuillier, wife of Louis-Jerome Thuillier, who gives six thousand in the
      Three-per-cents, capital and interest, and six thousand more at her
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is just as if the notary had written it down,&rdquo; said Brigitte;
      &ldquo;but if it is your custom you can see my sister-in-law; they will show you
      the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the old maid ordered the &ldquo;male domestic&rdquo; to take the clerk to
      Madame Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the clerk returned, saying there was certainly some
      misunderstanding, and that Madame Thuillier declared she had no intention
      of making any agreement in favor of the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty thing!&rdquo; cried Brigitte. &ldquo;Come with me, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, like a hurricane, she rushed into Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s chamber; the
      latter was pale and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this you have told monsieur?&mdash;that you give nothing to
      Celeste&rsquo;s &lsquo;dot&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the slave, declaring insurrection, although in a shaking
      voice; &ldquo;my intention is to do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your intention,&rdquo; said Brigitte, scarlet with anger, &ldquo;is something new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my intention,&rdquo; was all the rebel replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you will give your reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marriage does not please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! and since when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary that monsieur should listen to our discussion,&rdquo; said
      Madame Thuillier; &ldquo;it will not appear in the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder you are ashamed of it,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;the appearance you are
      making is not very flattering to you&mdash;Monsieur,&rdquo; she continued,
      addressing the clerk, &ldquo;it is easier, is it not, to mark out passages in a
      contract than to add them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk made an affirmative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then put in what you were told to write; later, if madame persists, the
      clause can be stricken out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk bowed and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two sisters-in-law were alone together, Brigitte began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have you lost your head? What is this crotchet you&rsquo;ve
      taken into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a crotchet; it is a fixed idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you got from the Abbe Gondrin; you dare not deny that you went to
      see him with Celeste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that Celeste and I saw our director this morning, but I did
      not open my lips to him about what I intended to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, it is in your own empty head that this notion sprouted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. As I told you yesterday, I think Celeste can be more suitably
      married, and my intention is not to rob myself for a marriage of which I
      disapprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> disapprove! Upon my word! are we all to take madame&rsquo;s advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; replied Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;that I count for nothing in this
      house. So far as I am concerned, I have long accepted my position; but,
      when the matter concerns the happiness of a child I regard as my own&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, &ldquo;you never knew how to have one; for,
      certainly, Thuillier&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier, with dignity, &ldquo;I took the sacrament this
      morning, and there are some things I cannot listen to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a canting hypocrite for you!&rdquo; cried Brigitte; &ldquo;playing the saint,
      and bringing trouble into families! And you think to succeed, do you? Wait
      till Thuillier comes home, and he&rsquo;ll shake this out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By calling in the marital authority in support of her own, Brigitte showed
      weakness before the unexpected resistance thus made to her inveterate
      tyranny. Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s calm words, which became every moment more
      resolute, baffled her completely, and she found no resource but insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drone!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;a helpless good-for-nothing! who can&rsquo;t even pick up
      her own handkerchief! that thing wants to be mistress of this house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish so little to be its mistress,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;that last
      night I allowed you to silence me after the first words I said in behalf
      of Celeste. But I am mistress of my own property, and as I believe that
      Celeste will be wretched in this marriage, I keep it to use as may seem
      best to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your property, indeed!&rdquo; said Brigitte, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that which I received from my father and my mother, and which I
      brought as my &lsquo;dot&rsquo; to Monsieur Thuillier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray who invested it, this property, and made it give you twelve
      thousand francs a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never asked you for any account of it,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier,
      gently. &ldquo;If it had been lost in the uses you made of it, you would never
      have heard a single word from me; but it has prospered, and it is just
      that I should have the benefit. It is not for myself that I reserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; if this is the course you take, it is not at all sure that
      you and I will go out of the same door long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that Monsieur Thuillier will send me away? He must have
      reasons for doing that, and, thank God! I have been a wife above
      reproach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viper! hypocrite! heartless creature!&rdquo; cried Brigitte, coming to an end
      of her arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier, &ldquo;you are in my apartment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, you imbecile?&rdquo; cried the old maid, in a paroxysm of anger. &ldquo;If I
      didn&rsquo;t restrain myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she made a gesture both insulting and threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Thuillier rose to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you shall not go out,&rdquo; cried Brigitte, pushing her down into her
      chair; &ldquo;and till Thuillier comes home and decides what he will do with you
      you&rsquo;ll stay locked up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as Brigitte, her face on fire, returned to the room where she had
      left Madame Colleville, her brother came in. He was radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said to the Megaera, not observing her fury, &ldquo;everything is
      going on finely; the conspiracy of silence is broken; two papers, the
      &lsquo;National&rsquo; and a Carlist journal, have copied articles from us, and
      there&rsquo;s a little attack in a ministerial paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all is not going on finely here,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;and if it
      continues, I shall leave the barrack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you angry with now?&rdquo; asked Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your insolent wife, who has made me a scene; I am trembling all
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste make you a scene!&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;then it is the very first
      time in her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a beginning to everything, and if you don&rsquo;t bring her to order&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was it about&mdash;this scene?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About madame&rsquo;s not choosing that la Peyrade should marry her goddaughter;
      and out of spite, to prevent the marriage, she refused to give anything in
      the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, be calm,&rdquo; said Thuillier, not disturbed himself, the admission of
      the &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; into the polemic making another Pangloss of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle
      all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Flavie,&rdquo; said Brigitte, when Thuillier had departed to his wife,
      &ldquo;you will do me the pleasure to go down to your own apartment, and tell
      Mademoiselle Celeste that I don&rsquo;t choose to see her now, because if she
      made me any irritating answer I might box her ears. You&rsquo;ll tell her that I
      don&rsquo;t like conspiracies; that she was left at liberty to choose Monsieur
      Phellion junior if she wanted him, and she did not want him; that the
      matter is now all arranged, and that if she does not wish to see her &lsquo;dot&rsquo; 
      reduced to what you are able to give her, which isn&rsquo;t as much as a
      bank-messenger could carry in his waistcoat pocket&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Brigitte,&rdquo; interrupted Flavie, turning upon her at this
      impertinence, &ldquo;you may dispense with reminding us in this harsh way of our
      poverty; for, after all, we have never asked you for anything, and we pay
      our rent punctually; and as for the &lsquo;dot,&rsquo; Monsieur Felix Phellion is
      quite ready to take Celeste with no more than a bank-messenger could carry
      in his <i>bag</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she emphasized the last word by her way of pronouncing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! so you too are going to meddle in this, are you?&rdquo; cried Brigitte.
      &ldquo;Very good; go and fetch him, your Felix. I know, my little woman, that
      this marriage has never suited you; it IS disagreeable to be nothing more
      than a mother to your son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flavie had recovered the coolness she had lost for an instant, and without
      replying to this speech she merely shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Thuillier returned; his air of beatitude had deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Brigitte,&rdquo; he said to his sister, &ldquo;you have a most excellent
      heart, but at times you are so violent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the old maid, &ldquo;am I to be arraigned on this side too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do not blame you for the cause of the trouble, and I have
      just rebuked Celeste for her assumption; but there are proper forms that
      must be kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forms! what are you talking about? What forms have I neglected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear friend, to raise your hand against your sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, raise my hand against that imbecile? What nonsense you talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; continued Thuillier, &ldquo;a woman of Celeste&rsquo;s age can&rsquo;t be
      kept in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife!&mdash;have I put her in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny it, for I found the door of her room double-locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! all this because in my anger at the infamous things she was
      spitting at me I may have turned the key of the door without intending
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;these are not proper actions for people of
      our class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! so it is I who am to blame, is it? Well, my lad, some day you&rsquo;ll
      remember this, and we shall see how your household will get along when I
      have stopped taking care of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always take care of it,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;Housekeeping is your
      very life; you will be the first to get over this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;after twenty years of devotion, to
      be treated like the lowest of the low!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rushing to the door, which she slammed after her with violence, she
      went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was not disturbed by this exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you there, Flavie,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;when the scene took place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it happened in Celeste&rsquo;s room. What did she do to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I said,&mdash;raised her hand to her and locked her in like a child.
      Celeste may certainly be rather dull-minded, but there are limits that
      must not be passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not always pleasant, that good Brigitte,&rdquo; said Flavie; &ldquo;she and I
      have just had a little set-to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;it will all pass off. I want to tell you, my
      dear Flavie, what fine success we have had this morning. The &lsquo;National&rsquo; 
      quotes two whole paragraphs of an article in which there were several
      sentences of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was again interrupted in the tale of his great political and
      literary success,&mdash;this time by the entrance of Josephine the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can monsieur tell me where to find the key of the great trunk?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with it?&rdquo; asked Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle told me to take it to her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle must be going to make a journey. She is getting her linen
      out of the drawers, and her gowns are on the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another piece of nonsense!&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;Flavie, go and see what she
      has in her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Madame Colleville; &ldquo;go yourself. In her present state of
      exasperation she might beat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my stupid wife, who must needs raise a fuss about the contract!&rdquo;
       cried Thuillier. &ldquo;She really must have said something pretty sharp to turn
      Brigitte off her hinges like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has not told me where to find the key,&rdquo; persisted Josephine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; said Thuillier, crossly; &ldquo;go and look
      for it, or else tell her it is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Josephine, &ldquo;it is likely I&rsquo;d dare to go and tell her
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the outer door-bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt that&rsquo;s la Peyrade,&rdquo; said Thuillier, in a tone of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Provencal appeared a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, my dear friend,&rdquo; cried Thuillier, &ldquo;it is high time you came; the
      house is in revolution, all about you, and it needs your silvery tongue to
      bring it back to peace and quietness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he related to his assistant editor the circumstances of the civil war
      which had broken out.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade turned to Madame Colleville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that under the circumstances in which we now stand
      there is no impropriety in my asking for an interview of a few moments
      with Mademoiselle Colleville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this the Provencal showed his usual shrewd ability; he saw that in the
      mission of pacification thus given to him Celeste Colleville was the key
      of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send for her, and we will leave you alone together,&rdquo; said Flavie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Thuillier,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;you must, without any violence, let
      Mademoiselle Celeste know that her consent must be given without further
      delay; make her think that this was the purpose for which you have sent
      for her; then leave us; I will do the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man-servant was sent down to the entresol with orders to tell Celeste
      that her godfather wished to speak to her. As soon as she appeared,
      Thuillier said, to carry out the programme which had been dictated to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, your mother has told us things that astonish us. Can it be true
      that with your contract almost signed, you have not yet decided to accept
      the marriage we have arranged for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfather,&rdquo; said Celeste, rather surprised at this abrupt summons, &ldquo;I
      think I did not say that to mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not just now,&rdquo; said Flavie, &ldquo;praise Monsieur Felix Phellion to me
      in the most extravagant manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke of Monsieur Phellion as all the world is speaking of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Thuillier, with authority, &ldquo;let us have no
      equivocation; do you refuse, yes or no, to marry Monsieur de la Peyrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, good friend,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, intervening, &ldquo;your way of putting
      the question is rather too abrupt, and, in my presence, especially, it
      seems to me out of place. In my position as the most interested person,
      will you allow me to have an interview with mademoiselle, which, indeed,
      has now become necessary? This favor I am sure will not be refused by
      Madame Colleville. Under present circumstances, there can surely be
      nothing in my request to alarm her maternal prudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would certainly yield to it,&rdquo; said Flavie, &ldquo;if I did not fear that
      these discussions might seem to open a question which is irrevocably
      decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear madame, I have the strongest desire that Mademoiselle
      Celeste shall remain, until the very last moment, the mistress of her own
      choice. I beg you, therefore, to grant my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; said Madame Colleville; &ldquo;you think yourself very clever, but
      if you let that girl twist you round her finger, so much the worse for
      you. Come, Thuillier, since we are &lsquo;de trop&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the pair were alone together, la Peyrade drew up a chair for
      Celeste, and took one himself, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, I venture to believe, do me the justice to say that until
      to-day I have never annoyed you with the expression of my sentiments. I
      was aware of the inclinations of your heart, and also of the warnings of
      your conscience. I hoped, after a time, to make myself acceptable as a
      refuge from those two currents of feeling; but, at the point which we have
      now reached, I think it is not either indiscreet or impatient to ask you
      to let me know plainly what course you have decided upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Celeste, &ldquo;as you speak to me so kindly and frankly, I
      will tell you, what indeed you know already, that, brought up as I was
      with Monsieur Felix Phellion, knowing him far longer than I have known
      you, the idea of marrying alarmed me less in regard to him than it would
      in regard to others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At one time, I believe,&rdquo; remarked la Peyrade, &ldquo;you were permitted to
      choose him if you wished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but at that time difficulties grew up between us on religious
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-day those difficulties have disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly,&rdquo; replied Celeste. &ldquo;I am accustomed to submit to the judgment of
      those who are wiser than myself, monsieur, and you heard yesterday the
      manner in which the Abbe Gondrin spoke of Monsieur Phellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that I should seek to invalidate the
      judgment of so excellent a man; but I venture to say to you, mademoiselle,
      that there are great differences among the clergy; some are thought too
      stern, some far too indulgent; moreover, the Abbe Gondrin is more of a
      preacher than a casuist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Monsieur Felix,&rdquo; said Celeste, eagerly, &ldquo;seems to wish to fulfil
      Monsieur l&rsquo;abbe&rsquo;s hopes of him, for I know that he went to see him this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with a touch of irony, &ldquo;so he really decided to go
      to Pere Anselme! But, admitting that on the religious side Monsieur
      Phellion may now become all that you expect of him, have you reflected,
      mademoiselle, on the great event which has just taken place in his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly; and that is not a reason to think less of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it is a reason why he should think more of himself. For the
      modesty which was once the chief charm of his nature, he is likely to
      substitute great assumption, and you must remember, mademoiselle, that he
      who has discovered one world will want to discover two; you will have the
      whole firmament for rival; in short, could you ever be happy with a man so
      entirely devoted to science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You plead your cause with such adroitness,&rdquo; said Celeste, smiling, &ldquo;that
      I think you might be as a lawyer more disquieting than an astronomer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;let us speak seriously; there is another
      and far more serious aspect to the situation. Do you know that, at this
      moment, in this house, and without, I am sure, desiring it, you are the
      cause of most distressing and regrettable scenes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, monsieur!&rdquo; said Celeste, in a tone of surprise that was mingled with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, concerning your godmother. Through the extreme affection that she
      has for you she seems to have become another woman; for the first time in
      her life she has shown a mind of her own. With an energy of will which
      comes at times to those who have never expended any, she declares that she
      will not make her proposed liberal gift to you in the contract; and I need
      not tell you who is the person aimed at in this unexpected refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, I entreat you to believe that I knew nothing of this idea
      of my godmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;and the matter itself would be of small
      importance if Mademoiselle Brigitte had not taken this attitude of your
      godmother, whom she has always found supple to her will, as a personal
      insult to herself. Very painful explanations, approaching at last to
      violence, have taken place. Thuillier, placed between the hammer and the
      anvil, has been unable to stop the affair; on the contrary, he has,
      without intending it, made matters worse, till they have now arrived at
      such a point that Mademoiselle Brigitte is packing her trunks to leave the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur! what are you telling me?&rdquo; cried Celeste, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth; and the servants will confirm it to you&mdash;for I feel that
      my revelations are scarcely believable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is impossible! impossible!&rdquo; said the poor child, whose agitation
      increased with every word of the adroit Provencal. &ldquo;I cannot be the cause
      of such dreadful harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, you did not intend to be, for the harm is done; and I pray
      Heaven it may not be irremediable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do, good God!&rdquo; cried Celeste, wringing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should answer, without hesitation, sacrifice yourself, mademoiselle, if
      it were not that I should then be forced to play the painful part of
      victimizer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Celeste, &ldquo;you interpret ill the resistance that I have
      made, though, in fact, I have scarcely expressed it. I have certainly had
      a preference, but I have never considered myself in the light of a victim;
      and whatever it is necessary to do to restore peace in this house to which
      I have brought trouble, I shall do it without repugnance, and even
      willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be for me,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, humbly, &ldquo;more than I could dare
      ask for myself; but, for the result which we both seek, I must tell you
      frankly that something more is needed. Madame Thuillier has not changed
      her nature to instantly change back again on the mere assurance by others
      of your compliance. It is necessary that she should hear from your own
      lips that you accede to my suit, and that you do so with eagerness,&mdash;assumed,
      indeed, but sufficiently well assumed to induce her to believe in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Celeste. &ldquo;I shall know how to seem smiling and happy. My
      godmother, monsieur, has been a mother to me; and for such a mother, what
      is there that I would not endure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The position was such, and Celeste betrayed so artlessly the depth and, at
      the same time, the absolute determination of her sacrifice, that with any
      heart at all la Peyrade would have loathed the part he was playing; but
      Celeste, to him, was a means of ascent, and provided the ladder can hold
      you and hoist you, who would ever ask if it cared to or not? It was
      therefore decided that Celeste should go to her godmother and convince her
      of the mistake she had made in supposing an objection to la Peyrade which
      Celeste had never intended to make. Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s opposition
      overcome, all was once more easy. La Peyrade took upon himself the duty of
      making peace between the two sisters-in-law, and we can well imagine that
      he was not at a loss for fine phrases with which to assure the artless
      girl of the devotion and love which would take from her all regret for the
      moral compulsion she had now undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Celeste went to her godmother she found her by no means as difficult
      to convince as she had expected. To go to the point of rebellion which
      Madame Thuillier had actually reached, the poor woman, who was acting
      against her instincts and against her nature, had needed a tension of will
      that, in her, was almost superhuman. No sooner had she received the false
      confidences of her goddaughter than the reaction set in; the strength
      failed her to continue in the path she had taken. She was therefore easily
      the dupe of the comedy which Celeste&rsquo;s tender heart was made to play for
      la Peyrade&rsquo;s benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest calmed on this side, the barrister found no difficulty in
      making Brigitte understand that in quelling the rebellion against her
      authority she had gone a little farther than was proper. This authority
      being no longer in danger, Brigitte ceased to be incensed with the
      sister-in-law she had been on the point of beating, and the quarrel was
      settled with a few kind words and a kiss, poor Celeste paying the costs of
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, which was only a family meal, the notary, to whose office
      they were to go on the following day to sign the contract (it being
      impossible to give a second edition of the abortive party), made his
      appearance. He came, he said, to submit the contract to the parties
      interested before engrossing it. This attention was not surprising in a
      man who was just entering into business relations with so important a
      person as the municipal councillor, whom it was his interest to firmly
      secure for a client.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was far too shrewd to make any objections to the terms of the
      contract, which was now read. A few changes requested by Brigitte, which
      gave the new notary a high idea of the old maid&rsquo;s business capacity,
      showed la Peyrade plainly that more precautions were being taken against
      him than were altogether becoming; but he was anxious not to raise
      difficulties, and he knew that the meshes of a contract are never so close
      that a determined and clever man cannot get through them. The appointment
      was then made for the signing of the contract the next day, at two
      o&rsquo;clock, in the notary&rsquo;s office, the family only being present.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the rest of the evening, taking advantage of Celeste&rsquo;s pledge to
      seem smiling and happy, la Peyrade played, as it were, upon the poor
      child, forced her, by a specious exhibition of gratitude and love, to
      respond to him on a key that was far, indeed, from the true state of a
      heart now wholly filled by Felix. Flavie, seeing the manner in which la
      Peyrade put forth his seductions, was reminded of the pains he had
      formerly taken to fascinate herself. &ldquo;The monster!&rdquo; she said, beneath her
      breath. But she was forced to bear the torture with a good grace; la
      Peyrade was evidently approved by all, and in the course of the evening a
      circumstance came to light, showing a past service done by him to the
      house of Thuillier, which brought his influence and his credit to the
      highest point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minard was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to make a little revelation which
      will greatly surprise you, and will, I think, prove a lesson to all of us
      when a question arises as to receiving foreigners in our homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Brigitte, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Hungarian woman you were so delighted with, that Madame Torna,
      Comtesse de Godollo&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; exclaimed the old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;she was no better than she should be; you were
      petting in your house for two months the most impudent of kept women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that tale?&rdquo; asked Brigitte, not willing to admit that she
      had fallen into such a snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t a tale,&rdquo; said the mayor, eagerly. &ldquo;I know the thing myself,
      &lsquo;de visu.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! do you frequent such women?&rdquo; said Brigitte, resuming the
      offensive. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty thing! what would Zelie say if she knew it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the discharge of my duties,&rdquo; said Minard, stiffly, provoked at this
      reception of his news, &ldquo;I have seen <i>your friend</i>, Madame de Godollo,
      in company with others of her class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it was she if you only saw her?&rdquo; demanded Brigitte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wily Provencal was not the man to lose an occasion that fell to him
      ready-made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le maire is not mistaken,&rdquo; he said, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens! so you know her, too,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;and you let us consort with
      such vermin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;on the contrary. Without scandal, without saying a
      word to any one, I removed her from your house. You remember how suddenly
      the woman left it? It was I who compelled her to do so; having discovered
      what she was, I gave her two days to leave the premises; threatening her,
      in case she hesitated, to tell you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Theodose,&rdquo; said Thuillier, pressing his hand, &ldquo;you acted with as
      much prudence as decision. This is one more obligation that we owe to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, addressing Celeste, &ldquo;the strange
      protectress whom a friend of yours selected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said Madame Thuillier. &ldquo;Felix Phellion is above such vile
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! papa Minard, we&rsquo;ll keep quiet about all this; silence is the word.
      Will you take a cup of tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; said the old maid, &ldquo;ring for Henri, and tell him to put the
      large kettle on the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the visit to the notary was not to be made till two in the
      afternoon, Brigitte began early in the morning of the next day what
      Thuillier called her <i>rampage</i>, a popular term which expresses that
      turbulent, nagging, irritating activity which La Fontaine has described so
      well in his fable of &ldquo;The Old Woman and her Servants.&rdquo; Brigitte declared
      that if you didn&rsquo;t take time by the forelock no one would be ready. She
      prevented Thuillier from going to his office, insisting that if he once
      got off she never should see him again; she plagued Josephine, the cook,
      about hurrying the breakfast, and in spite of what had happened the day
      before she scarcely restrained herself from nagging at Madame Thuillier,
      who did not enter, as she thought she should have done, into her favorite
      maxim, &ldquo;Better be early than late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently down she went to the Collevilles&rsquo; to make the same disturbance;
      and there she put her veto on the costume, far too elegant, which Flavie
      meditated wearing, and told Celeste the hat and gown she wished her to
      appear in. As for Colleville, who could not, he declared, stay away all
      the morning from his official duties, she compelled him to put on his
      dress-suit before he went out, made him set his watch by hers, and warned
      him that if he was late no one would wait for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amusing part of it was that Brigitte herself, after driving every one
      at the point of the bayonet, came very near being late herself. Under
      pretext of aiding others, independently of minding her own business,
      which, for worlds, she would never have spared herself, she had put her
      fingers and eyes into so many things that they ended by overwhelming her.
      However, she ascribed the delay in which she was almost caught to the
      hairdresser, whom she had sent for to make, on this extraordinary
      occasion, what she called her &ldquo;part.&rdquo; That artist having, unadvisedly,
      dressed her hair in the fashion, he was compelled, after she had looked at
      herself in the glass, to do his work over again, and conform to the usual
      style of his client, which consisted chiefly in never being &ldquo;done&rdquo; at all,
      a method that gave her head a general air of what is vulgarly called &ldquo;a
      cross cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About half-past one o&rsquo;clock la Peyrade, Thuillier, Colleville, Madame
      Thuillier, and Celeste were assembled in the salon. Flavie joined them
      soon after, fastening her bracelets as she came along to avoid a rebuff,
      and having the satisfaction of knowing that she was ready before Brigitte.
      As for the latter, already furious at finding herself late, she had
      another cause for exasperation. The event of the day seemed to require a
      corset, a refinement which she usually discarded. The unfortunate maid,
      whose duty it was to lace her and to discover the exact point to which she
      was willing to be drawn in, alone knew the terrors and storms of a corset
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;lace the obelisk; I know it would lend
      itself to being laced better than she does; and, anyhow, it couldn&rsquo;t be
      bad-tongued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the party in the salon were amusing themselves, under their breaths,
      at the &ldquo;flagrante delicto&rdquo; of unpunctuality in which Queen Elizabeth was
      caught, the porter entered, and gave to Thuillier a sealed package,
      addressed to &ldquo;Monsieur Thuillier, director of the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre.&rsquo; <i>In
      haste</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier opened the envelope, and found within a copy of a ministerial
      journal which had hitherto shown itself discourteous to the new paper by
      refusing the <i>exchange</i> which all periodicals usually make very
      willingly with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzled by the fact of this missive being sent to his own house and not to
      the office of the &ldquo;Echo,&rdquo; Thuillier hastily opened the sheet, and read,
      with what emotion the reader may conceive, the following article,
      commended to his notice by a circle in red ink:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  An obscure organ was about to expire in its native shade when an
  ambitious person of recent date bethought himself of galvanizing
  it. His object was to make it a foothold by which to climb from
  municipal functions to the coveted position of deputy. Happily
  this object, having come to the surface, will end in failure.
  Electors will certainly not be inveigled by so wily a manner of
  advancing self-interests; and when the proper time arrives, if
  ridicule has not already done justice on this absurd candidacy, we
  shall ourselves prove to the pretender that to aspire to the
  distinguished honor of representing the nation something more is
  required than the money to buy a paper and pay an underling to put
  into good French the horrible diction of his articles and
  pamphlets. We confine ourselves to-day to this limited notice, but
  our readers may be sure that we shall keep them informed about
  this electoral comedy, if indeed the parties concerned have the
  melancholy courage to go on with it.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thuillier read twice over this sudden declaration of war, which was far
      from leaving him calm and impassible; then, taking la Peyrade aside, he
      said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that; it is serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said la Peyrade, after reading the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? how well?&rdquo; exclaimed Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, what do you find so serious in that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I find so serious?&rdquo; repeated Thuillier. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything
      could be more insulting to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t doubt,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that the virtuous Cerizet is at the
      bottom of it; he has thrown this firecracker between your legs by way of
      revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet, or anybody else who wrote that diatribe is an insolent fellow,&rdquo;
       cried Thuillier, getting angry, &ldquo;and the matter shall not rest there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I advise you to make no reply. You are
      not named; though, of course, the attack is aimed at you. But you ought to
      let our adversary commit himself farther; when the right moment comes,
      we&rsquo;ll rap him over the knuckles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay quiet one minute under such an
      insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said the barrister; &ldquo;what a sensitive epidermis! Do reflect,
      my dear fellow, that you have made yourself a candidate and a journalist,
      and therefore you really must harden yourself better than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend, it is a principle of mine not to let anybody step on my
      toes. Besides, they say themselves they are going on with this thing.
      Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to cut short such impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do consider,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;Certainly in journalism, as in
      candidacy, a hot temper has its uses; a man makes himself respected, and
      stops attacks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;&lsquo;principiis obsta.&rsquo; Not to-day, because we
      haven&rsquo;t the time, but to-morrow I shall carry that paper into court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into court!&rdquo; echoed la Peyrade; &ldquo;you surely wouldn&rsquo;t go to law in such a
      matter as this? In the first place, there is nothing to proceed upon; you
      are not named nor the paper either, and, besides, it is a pitiable
      business, going to law; you&rsquo;ll look like a boy who has been fighting, and
      got the worst of it, and runs to complain to his mamma. Now if you had
      said that you meant to make Fleury intervene in the matter, I could
      understand that&mdash;though the affair is rather personal to you, and it
      might be difficult to make it seem&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;do you suppose I am going to commit myself with
      a Cerizet or any other newspaper bully? I pique myself, my dear fellow, on
      possessing civic courage, which does not give in to prejudices, and which,
      instead of taking justice into its own hands, has recourse to the means of
      defence that are provided by law. Besides, with the legal authority the
      Court of Cassation now has over duelling, I have no desire to put myself
      in the way of being expatriated, or spending two or three years in
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll talk it over later; here&rsquo;s your sister,
      and she would think everything lost if this little matter reached her
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Brigitte appeared Colleville shouted &ldquo;Full!&rdquo; and proceeded to sing
      the chorus of &ldquo;La Parisienne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! Colleville, how vulgar you are!&rdquo; cried the tardy one, hastening
      to cast a stone in the other&rsquo;s garden to avoid the throwing of one into
      hers. &ldquo;Well, are you all ready?&rdquo; she added, arranging her mantle before a
      mirror. &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it? it won&rsquo;t do to get there before the time,
      like provincials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes to two,&rdquo; said Colleville; &ldquo;I go by the Tuileries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then we are just right,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;it will take about that
      time to get to the rue Caumartin. Josephine,&rdquo; she cried, going to the door
      of the salon, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll dine at six, therefore be sure you put the turkey to
      roast at the right time, and mind you don&rsquo;t burn it, as you did the other
      day. Bless me! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; and with a hasty motion she shut the door,
      which she had been holding open. &ldquo;What a nuisance! I hope Henri will have
      the sense to tell him we are out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not at all; Henri came in to say that an old gentleman, with a very
      genteel air, had asked to be received on urgent business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say we were all out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I should have done if mademoiselle had not opened the door of
      the salon so that the gentleman could see the whole family assembled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;you are never in the wrong, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to say to him?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, &ldquo;that I am very sorry not to be able to receive
      him, but I am expected at a notary&rsquo;s office about a marriage contract; but
      that if he could return two hours hence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told him all that,&rdquo; said Henri, &ldquo;and he answered that that
      contract was precisely what he had come about, and that his business
      concerned you more than himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go and see him, Thuillier, and get rid of him in
      double-quick,&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s shorter than talking to Henri, who
      is always an orator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If la Peyrade had been consulted he might not have joined in that advice,
      for he had had more than one specimen of the spokes some occult influence
      was putting into the wheels of his marriage, and the present visit seemed
      to him ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him into my study,&rdquo; said Thuillier, following his sister&rsquo;s advice;
      and, opening the door which led from the salon to the study, he went to
      receive his importunate visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigitte immediately applied her eye to the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my imbecile of a Thuillier offering
      him a chair! and away in a corner, too, where I can&rsquo;t hear a word they
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was walking about the room with an inward agitation covered by
      an appearance of great indifference. He even went up to the three women,
      and made a few lover-like speeches to Celeste, who received them with a
      smiling, happy air in keeping with the role she was playing. As for
      Colleville, he was killing the time by composing an anagram on the six
      words of &ldquo;le journal &lsquo;l&rsquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rsquo;&rdquo; for which he had found the
      following version, little reassuring (as far as it went) for the prospects
      of that newspaper: &ldquo;O d&rsquo;Echo, jarni! la bevue reell&rdquo;&mdash;but as the
      final &ldquo;e&rdquo; was lacking to complete the last word, the work was not
      altogether as satisfactory as it should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking snuff!&rdquo; said Brigitte, her eye still glued to the keyhole;
      &ldquo;his gold snuff-box beats Minard&rsquo;s&mdash;though, perhaps, it is only
      silver-gilt,&rdquo; she added, reflectively. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing the talking, and
      Thuillier is sitting there listening to him like a buzzard. I shall go in
      and tell them they can&rsquo;t keep ladies waiting that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But just as she put her hand on the lock she heard Thuillier&rsquo;s visitor
      raise his voice, and that made her look through the keyhole again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is standing up; he&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; she said with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a moment later she saw she had made a mistake; the little old man had
      only left his chair to walk up and down the room and continue the
      conversation with greater freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious! I shall certainly go in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell Thuillier we
      are going without him, and he can follow us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the old maid gave two little sharp and very imperious raps on
      the door, after which she resolutely entered the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade, goaded by anxiety, had the bad taste to look through the
      keyhole himself at what was happening. Instantly he thought he recognized
      the small old man he had seen under the name of &ldquo;the commander&rdquo; on that
      memorable morning when he had waited for Madame de Godollo. Then he saw
      Thuillier addressing his sister with impatience and with gestures of
      authority altogether out of his usual habits of deference and submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Brigitte, re-entering the salon, &ldquo;that Thuillier finds
      some great interest in that creature&rsquo;s talk, for he ordered me bluntly to
      leave them, though the little old fellow did say, rather civilly, that
      they would soon be through. But Jerome added: &lsquo;<i>Mind</i>, you are to
      wait for me.&rsquo; Really, since he has taken to making newspapers I don&rsquo;t know
      him; he has set up an air as if he were leading the world with his wand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much afraid he is being entangled by some adventurer,&rdquo; said la
      Peyrade. &ldquo;I am pretty sure I saw that old man at Madame de Godollo&rsquo;s the
      day I went to warn her off the premises; he must be of the same stripe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; cried Brigitte. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have asked him for news of
      the countess, and let him see we knew what we knew of his Hungarian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the sound of moving chairs was heard, and Brigitte darted back
      to the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is really going, and Thuillier is bowing him out
      respectfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Thuillier did not immediately return, Colleville had time to go to the
      window and exclaim at seeing the little old gentleman driving away in an
      elegant coupe, of which the reader has already heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; cried Colleville; &ldquo;what an ornate livery! If he is an
      adventurer he is a number one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Thuillier re-entered the room, his face full of care, his manner
      extremely grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear la Peyrade,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you did not tell us that another proposal
      of marriage had been seriously considered by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did; I told you that a very rich heiress had been offered to me,
      but that my inclinations were here, and that I had not given any
      encouragement to the affair; consequently, of course, there was no serious
      engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you do wrong to treat that proposal so lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you mean to say, in presence of these ladies, that you blame me
      for remaining faithful to my first desires and our old engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, the conversation that I have just had has been a most
      instructive one to me; and when you know what I know, with other details
      personal to yourself, which will be confided to you, I think that you will
      enter into my ideas. One thing is certain; we shall not go to the notary
      to-day; and as for you, the best thing that you can do is to go, without
      delay, to Monsieur du Portail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That name again! it pursues me like a remorse,&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; go at once; he is awaiting you. It is an indispensable preliminary
      before we can go any farther. When you have seen that excellent man and
      heard what he has to say to you&mdash;well, <i>then</i> if you persist in
      claiming Celeste&rsquo;s hand, we might perhaps carry out our plans. Until then
      we shall take no steps in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my poor Thuillier,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;you have let yourself be
      gammoned by a rascal; that man belongs to the Godollo set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Godollo,&rdquo; replied Thuillier, &ldquo;is not at all what you suppose
      her to be, and the best thing this house can do is never to say one word
      about her, either good or evil. As for la Peyrade, as this is not the
      first time he has been requested to go and see Monsieur du Portail, I am
      surprised that he hesitates to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;that little old man has completely befooled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that that little old man is all that he appears to be. He
      wears seven crosses, he drives in a splendid equipage, and he has told me
      things that have overwhelmed me with astonishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps he&rsquo;s a fortune-teller like Madame Fontaine, who managed
      once upon a time to upset me when Madame Minard and I, just to amuse
      ourselves, went to consult her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he is not a sorcerer he certainly has a very long arm,&rdquo; said
      Thuillier, &ldquo;and I think a man would suffer for it if he didn&rsquo;t respect his
      advice. As for you, Brigitte, he saw you only for a minute, but he told me
      your whole character; he said you were a masterful woman, born to
      command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Brigitte, licking her chops at this compliment, like a
      cat drinking cream, &ldquo;he has a very well-bred air, that little old fellow.
      You take my advice, my dear,&rdquo; she said, turning to la Peyrade; &ldquo;if such a
      very big-wig as that wants you to do so, go and see this du Portail,
      whoever he is. That, it seems to me, won&rsquo;t bind you to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Brigitte,&rdquo; said Colleville; &ldquo;as for me, I&rsquo;d follow up all
      the Portails, or Port<i>ers</i>, or Port<i>ents</i> for the matter of
      that, if they asked me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene was beginning to resemble that in the &ldquo;Barber of Seville,&rdquo; where
      everybody tells Basil to go to bed, for he certainly has a fever. La
      Peyrade, thus prodded, picked up his hat in some ill-humor, and went where
      his destiny called him,&mdash;&ldquo;quo sua fata vocabant.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. AT DU PORTAIL&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      On reaching the rue Honore-Chevalier la Peyrade felt a doubt; the
      dilapidated appearance of the house to which he was summoned made him
      think he had mistaken the number. It seemed to him that a person of
      Monsieur du Portail&rsquo;s evident importance could not inhabit such a place.
      It was therefore with some hesitation that he accosted Sieur Perrache, the
      porter. But no sooner had he entered the antechamber of the apartment
      pointed out to him than the excellent deportment of Bruneau, the old
      valet, and the extremely comfortable appearance of the furniture and other
      appointments made him see that he was probably in the right place.
      Introduced at once, as soon as he had given his name, into the study of
      the master of the house, his surprise was great when he found himself in
      presence of the commander, so called, the friend of Madame de Godollo, and
      the little old man he had seen half an hour earlier with Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; said du Portail, rising, and offering la Peyrade a chair, &ldquo;at
      last we meet, my refractory friend; it has taken a good deal to bring you
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know, monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, haughtily, not taking the chair
      which was offered to him, &ldquo;what interest you have in meddling with my
      affairs? I do not know you, and I may add that the place where I once saw
      you did not create an unconquerable desire in me to make your
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you seen me?&rdquo; asked du Portail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the apartment of a strumpet who called herself Madame de Godollo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where monsieur, consequently, went himself,&rdquo; said the little old man,
      &ldquo;and for a purpose much less disinterested than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come here,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;to bandy words with any one. I
      have the right, monsieur, to a full explanation as to the meaning of your
      proceedings towards me. I therefore request you not to delay them by a
      facetiousness to which, I assure you, I am not in the humor to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;sit down, for I am not in the
      humor to twist my neck by talking up at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were reasonable, and they were said in a tone that showed the
      old gentleman was not likely to be frightened by grand airs. La Peyrade
      therefore deferred to the wishes of his host, but he took care to do so
      with the worst grace possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Cerizet,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;a man of excellent standing in the
      world, and who has the honor to be one of your friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to do with that man now,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, sharply,
      understanding the malicious meaning of the old man&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the time has been,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;when you saw him, at least,
      occasionally: for instance, when you paid for his dinner at the Rocher de
      Cancale. As I was saying, I charged the virtuous Monsieur Cerizet to sound
      you as to a marriage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I refused,&rdquo; interrupted la Peyrade, &ldquo;and which I now refuse again,
      more vehemently than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I think, on the contrary, that
      you will accept it; and it is to talk over this affair with you that I
      have so long desired a meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this crazy girl that you are flinging at my head,&rdquo; said la Peyrade,
      &ldquo;what is she to you? She can&rsquo;t be your daughter, or you would put more
      decency into your hunt for a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young girl,&rdquo; replied du Portail, &ldquo;is the daughter of one of my
      friends who died about ten years ago; at his death I took her to live with
      me, and have given her all the care her sad condition needed. Her fortune,
      which I have greatly increased, added to my own, which I intend to leave
      to her, will make her a very rich heiress. I know that you are no enemy to
      handsome &lsquo;dots,&rsquo; for you have sought them in various places,&mdash;Thuillier&rsquo;s
      house, for instance, or, to use your own expression, that of a strumpet
      whom you scarcely knew. I have therefore supposed you would accept at my
      hands a very rich young woman, especially as her infirmity is declared by
      the best physicians to be curable; whereas you can never cure Monsieur and
      Mademoiselle Thuillier, the one of being a fool, the other of being a
      fury, any more than you could cure Madame Komorn of being a woman of very
      medium virtue and extremely giddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may suit me,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade, &ldquo;to marry the daughter of a fool and
      a fury if I choose her, or I might become the husband of a clever
      coquette, if passion seized me, but the Queen of Sheba herself, if imposed
      upon me, neither you, monsieur, nor the ablest and most powerful man
      living could force me to accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; therefore it is to your own good sense and intelligence that I
      now address myself; but we have to come face to face with people in order
      to speak to them, you know. Now, then, let us look into your present
      situation, and don&rsquo;t get angry if, like a surgeon who wants to cure his
      patient, I lay my hand mercilessly on wounds which have long tormented and
      harassed you. The first point to state is that the Celeste Colleville
      affair is at an end for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; demanded la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have just seen Thuillier and terrified him with the history of
      the misfortunes he has incurred, and those he will incur if he persists in
      the idea of giving you his goddaughter in marriage. He knows now that it
      was I who paralyzed Madame du Bruel&rsquo;s kind offices in the matter of the
      cross; that I had his pamphlet seized; that I sent that Hungarian woman
      into his house to handle you all, as she did; and that my hand is opening
      fire in the ministerial journals, which will only increase from bad to
      worse,&mdash;not to speak of other machinations which will be directed
      against his candidacy. Therefore you see, my good friend, that not only
      have you no longer the credit in Thuillier&rsquo;s eyes of being his great
      helper to that election, but that you actually block the way to his
      ambition. That is enough to prove to you that the side by which you have
      imposed yourself on that family&mdash;who have never sincerely liked or
      desired you&mdash;is now completely battered down and dismantled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to have done all that which you claim with such pretension, who are
      you?&rdquo; demanded la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not say that you are very inquisitive, for I intend to answer
      your question later; but for the present let us continue, if you please,
      the autopsy of your existence, dead to-day, but which I propose to
      resuscitate gloriously. You are twenty-eight years old, and you have begun
      a career in which I shall not allow you to make another step. A few days
      hence the Council of the order of barristers will assemble and will
      censure, more or less severely, your conduct in the matter of the property
      you placed with such candor in Thuillier&rsquo;s hands. Do not deceive yourself;
      censure from that quarter (and I mention only your least danger) is as
      fatal to a barrister as being actually disbarred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to your kind offices, no doubt,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;that I shall
      owe that precious result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I may boast of it,&rdquo; replied du Portail, &ldquo;for, in order to tow you
      into port it has been necessary to strip you of your rigging; unless that
      were done, you would always have tried to navigate under your own sails
      the bourgeois shoals that you are now among.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he, undoubtedly, had to do with a strong hand, la Peyrade
      thought best to modify his tone; and so, with a more circumspect air, he
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will allow me, monsieur, to reserve my acknowledgments until I
      receive some fuller explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, then,&rdquo; continued du Portail, &ldquo;at twenty-eight years of age,
      without a penny, virtually without a profession; with antecedents that are
      very&mdash;middling; with associates like Monsieur Dutocq and the
      courageous Cerizet; owing to Mademoiselle Thuillier ten thousand francs,
      and to Madame Lambert twenty-five thousand, which you are no doubt
      extremely desirous to return to her; and finally, this marriage, your last
      hope, your sheet-anchor, has just become an utter impossibility. Between
      ourselves, if I have something reasonable to propose to you, do you not
      think that you had much better place yourself at my disposal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have time enough to prove that your opinion is mistaken,&rdquo; returned la
      Peyrade; &ldquo;and I shall not form any resolutions so long as the designs you
      choose to have upon me are not more fully explained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were spoken to, at my instigation, about a marriage,&rdquo; resumed du
      Portail. &ldquo;This marriage, as I think, is closely connected with a past
      existence from which a certain hereditary or family duty has devolved upon
      you. Do you know what that uncle of yours, to whom you applied in 1829,
      was doing in Paris? In your family he was thought to be a millionaire;
      and, dying suddenly, you remember, before you got to him, he did not leave
      enough for his burial; a pauper&rsquo;s grave was all that remained to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know him?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my oldest and dearest friend,&rdquo; replied du Portail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, hastily, &ldquo;a sum of two thousand francs,
      which I received on my arrival in Paris from some unknown source&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came from me,&rdquo; replied du Portail. &ldquo;Unfortunately, engaged at the time in
      a rush of important affairs, which you shall hear of later, I could not
      immediately follow up the benevolent interest I felt in you for your
      uncle&rsquo;s sake; this explains why I left you in the straw of a garret, where
      you came, like a medlar, to that maturity of ruin which brought you under
      the hand of a Dutocq and a Cerizet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am none the less grateful to you, monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;and if I
      had known you were that generous protector, whom I was never able to
      discover, I should have been the first to seek occasion to meet you and to
      thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to compliments,&rdquo; said du Portail; &ldquo;and, to come at once to the
      serious side of our present conference, what should you say if I told you
      that this uncle, whose protection and assistance you came to Paris to
      obtain, was an agent of that occult power which has always been the theme
      of feeble ridicule and the object of silly prejudice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not seize your meaning,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with uneasy curiosity;
      &ldquo;may I ask you to be more precise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example, I will suppose,&rdquo; continued du Portail, &ldquo;that your uncle, if
      still living, were to say to you to-day: &lsquo;You are seeking fortune and
      influence, my good nephew; you want to rise above the crowd and to play
      your part in all the great events of your time; you want employment for a
      keen, active mind, full of resources, and slightly inclined to intrigue;
      in short, you long to exert in some upper and elegant sphere that force of
      will and subtlety which at present you are wasting in the silly and
      useless manipulation of the most barren and tough-skinned animal on earth,
      to wit: a bourgeois. Well, then, lower your head, my fine nephew; enter
      with me through the little door which I will open to you; it gives
      admittance to a great house, often maligned, but better far than its
      reputation. That threshold once crossed, you can rise to the height of
      your natural genius, whatever its spark may be. Statesmen, kings even,
      will admit you to their most secret thoughts; you will be their occult
      collaborator, and none of the joys which money and the highest powers can
      bestow upon a man will be lacking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; objected la Peyrade, &ldquo;without venturing to understand
      you, I must remark that my uncle died so poor, you tell me, that public
      charity buried him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle,&rdquo; replied du Portail, &ldquo;was a man of rare talent, but he had a
      certain weak side in his nature which compromised his career. He was eager
      for pleasure, a spendthrift, thoughtless for the future; he wanted also to
      taste those joys that are meant for the common run of men, but which for
      great, exceptional vocations are the worst of snares and impediments: I
      mean the joys of family. He had a daughter whom he madly loved, and it was
      through her that his terrible enemies opened a breach in his life, and
      prepared the horrible catastrophe that ended it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that an encouragement to enter this shady path, where, you say, he
      might have asked me to follow him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I myself,&rdquo; said du Portail, &ldquo;should offer to guide you in it, what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, monsieur!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, in stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I who was your uncle&rsquo;s pupil at first, and later his
      protector and providence; I, whose influence the last half-century has
      daily increased; I, who am wealthy; I, to whom all governments, as they
      fall one on top of the others like houses of cards, come to ask for safety
      and for the power to rebuild their future; I, who am the manager of a
      great theatre of puppets (where I have Columbines in the style of Madame
      de Godollo); I, who to-morrow, if it were necessary to the success of one
      of my vaudevilles or one of my dramas, might present myself to your eyes
      as the wearer of the grand cordon of the Legion of honor, of the Order of
      the Black Eagle, or that of the Golden Fleece. Do you wish to know why
      neither you nor I will die a violent death like your uncle, and also why,
      more fortunate than contemporaneous kings, I can transmit my sceptre to
      the successor whom I myself may choose? Because, like you, my young
      friend, in spite of your Southern appearance, I was cold, profoundly
      calculating, never tempted to lose my time on trifles at the outskirts;
      because heat, when I was led by force of circumstances to employ it, never
      went below the surface. It is more than probable that you have heard of
      me; well, for you I will open a window in my cloud; look at me, observe me
      well; have I a cloven hoof, or a tail at the end of my spine? On the
      contrary, am I not a model of the most inoffensive of householders in the
      Saint-Sulpice quarter? In that quarter, where I have enjoyed, I may say
      it, universal esteem for the last twenty-five years, I am called du
      Portail; but to you, if you will allow me, I shall now name myself <i>Corentin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corentin!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, with terrified astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; and you see that in telling you that secret I lay my hand
      upon you, and enlist you. Corentin! &lsquo;the greatest man of the police in
      modern times,&rsquo; as the author of an article in the &lsquo;Biographies of Living
      Men&rsquo; has said of me&mdash;as to whom I ought in justice to remark that he
      doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;I can assure you that I shall keep that
      secret; but the place which you offer me near you&mdash;in your employ&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That frightens you, or, at least, it makes you uneasy,&rdquo; said Corentin,
      quickly. &ldquo;Before you have even considered the thing the word scares you,
      does it? The police! <i>Police</i>! you are afraid to encounter the
      terrible prejudice that brands it on the brow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;it is a necessary institution; but I do not
      think that it is always calumniated. If the business of those who manage
      it is honorable why do they conceal themselves so carefully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because all that threatens society, which it is the mission of the police
      to repress,&rdquo; replied Corentin, &ldquo;is plotted and prepared in hiding. Do
      thieves and conspirators put upon their hats, &lsquo;I am Guillot, the shepherd
      of this flock&rsquo;? And when we are after them must we ring a bell to let them
      know we are coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;when a sentiment is universal it ceases to
      be a prejudice, it becomes an opinion; and this opinion ought to be a law
      to every man who desires to keep his own esteem and that of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you robbed that notary to enrich the Thuilliers for your own
      advantage,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;did you keep your own esteem and that of the
      Council of barristers? And who knows, monsieur, if in your life there are
      not still blacker actions than that? I am a more honorable man than you,
      because, outside of my functions, I have not one doubtful act upon my
      conscience; and when the opportunity for <i>good</i> has been presented to
      me I have done it&mdash;always and everywhere. Do you think that the
      guardianship of that poor insane girl in my home has been all roses? But
      she was the daughter of my old friend, your uncle, and when, feeling the
      years creep on me, I propose to you, between sacks of money, to fit
      yourself to take my place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, &ldquo;is that girl my uncle&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the girl I wish you to marry is the daughter of your uncle Peyrade,&mdash;for
      he democratized his name,&mdash;or, if you like it better, she was the
      daughter of Pere Canquoelle, a name he took from the little estate on
      which your father lived and starved with eleven children. You see, in
      spite of the secrecy your uncle always kept about his family, that I know
      all about it. Do you suppose that before selecting you as your cousin&rsquo;s
      husband I had not obtained every possible information about you? And what
      I have learned need not make you quite so supercilious to the police.
      Besides, as the vulgar saying is, the best of your nose is made of it.
      Your uncle belonged to the police, and, thanks to that, he became the
      confidant, I might almost say the friend, of Louis XVIII., who took the
      greatest pleasure in his companionship. And you, by nature and by mind,
      also by the foolish position into which you have got yourself, in short,
      by your whole being, have gravitated steadily to the conclusion I propose
      to you, namely, that of succeeding me,&mdash;of succeeding Corentin. That
      is the question between us, Monsieur. Do you really believe now that I
      have not a grasp or a &lsquo;seizin,&rsquo; as you call it, upon you, and that you can
      manage to escape me for any foolish considerations of bourgeois vanity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade could not have been at heart so violently opposed to this
      proposal as he seemed, for the vigorous language of the great master of
      the police and the species of appropriation which he made of his person
      brought a smile to the young man&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corentin had risen, and was walking up and down the room, speaking,
      apparently, to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;one may say of it, as Basile said of calumny to
      Batholo, &lsquo;The police, monsieur! you don&rsquo;t know what you despise!&rsquo; And,
      after all,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;who are they who despise it?
      Imbeciles, who don&rsquo;t know any better than to insult their protectors.
      Suppress the police, and you destroy civilization. Do the police ask for
      the respect of such people? No, they want to inspire them with one
      sentiment only: fear, that great lever with which to govern mankind,&mdash;an
      impure race whose odious instincts God, hell, the executioner, and the
      gendarmes can scarcely restrain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stopping short before la Peyrade, and looking at him with a disdainful
      smile, he continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are one of those ninnies who see in the police nothing more than a
      horde of spies and informers? Have you never suspected the statesmen, the
      diplomats, the Richelieus it produces? Mercury, monsieur,&mdash;Mercury,
      the cleverest of the gods of paganism,&mdash;what was he but the police
      incarnate? It is true that he was also the god of thieves. We are better
      than he, for we don&rsquo;t allow that junction of forces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;Vautrin, or, I should say, Jacques Collin,
      the famous chief of the detective police&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! but that&rsquo;s in the lower ranks,&rdquo; replied Corentin, resuming his
      walk; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always a muddy place somewhere. Still, don&rsquo;t be mistaken
      even in that. Vautrin is a man of genius, but his passions, like those of
      your uncle, dragged him down. But go up higher (for there lies the whole
      question, namely, the rung of the ladder on which a man has wits enough to
      perch). Take the prefect, for instance, that honored minister, flattered
      and respected, is he a spy? Well, I, monsieur, am the prefect of the
      secret police of diplomacy&mdash;of the highest statesmanship. And you
      hesitate to mount that throne!&mdash;to seem small and do great things; to
      live in a cave comfortably arranged like this, and command the light; to
      have at your orders an invisible army, always ready, always devoted,
      always submissive; to know the <i>other side</i> of everything; to be
      duped by no intrigue because you hold the threads of all within your
      fingers; to see through all partitions; to penetrate all secrets, search
      all hearts, all consciences,&mdash;these are the things you fear! And yet
      you were not afraid to go and wallow in a Thuillier bog; you, a
      thoroughbred, allowed yourself to be harnessed to a hackney-coach, to the
      ignoble business of electing that parvenu bourgeois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man does what he can,&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a very remarkable thing,&rdquo; pursued Corentin, replying to his own
      thought; &ldquo;the French language, more just than public opinion, has given us
      our right place, for it has made the word police the synonym of
      civilization and the antipodes of savage life, when it said and wrote:
      &lsquo;l&rsquo;Etat police,&rsquo; from the Greek words state and city. So, I can assure
      you, we care little for the prejudice that tries to brand us; none know
      men as we do; and to know them brings contempt for their contempt as well
      as for their esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is certainly much truth in what you say with such warmth,&rdquo; said la
      Peyrade, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much truth!&rdquo; exclaimed Corentin, going back to his chair, &ldquo;say, rather,
      that it is all true, and nothing but the truth; yet it is not the whole
      truth. But enough for to-day, monsieur. To succeed me in my functions, and
      to marry your cousin with a &lsquo;dot&rsquo; that will not be less than five hundred
      thousand francs, that is my offer. I do not ask you for an answer now. I
      should have no confidence in a determination not seriously reflected upon.
      To-morrow, I shall be at home all the morning. I trust that my conviction
      may then have formed yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dismissing his visitor with a curt little bow, he added: &ldquo;I do not bid you
      adieu, but au revoir, Monsieur de la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Corentin went to a side-table, where he found all that he needed
      to prepare a glass of &ldquo;eau sucree,&rdquo; which he had certainly earned, and,
      without looking at la Peyrade, who left the room rather stunned, he seemed
      to have no other interest on his mind than that prosaic preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it, indeed, necessary that the morning after this meeting with
      Corentin a visit from Madame Lambert, now become an exacting and
      importunate creditor, should come to bear its weight on la Peyrade&rsquo;s
      determination? As the great chief had pointed out to him the night before,
      was there not in his nature, in his mind, in his aspirations, in the
      mistakes and imprudences of his past life, a sort of irresistible incline
      which drew him down toward the strange solution of existence thus suddenly
      offered to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatality, if we may so call it, was lavish of the inducements to which he
      was destined to succumb. This day was the 31st of October; the vacation of
      the Palais was just over. The 2nd of November was the day on which the
      courts reopened, and as Madame Lambert left his room he received a summons
      to appear on that day before the Council of his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Madame Lambert, who pressed him sharply to repay her, under pretence
      that she was about to leave Monsieur Picot and return to her native place,
      he replied: &ldquo;Come here the day after to-morrow, at the same hour, and your
      money will be ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the summons to give account of his actions to his peers he replied that
      he did not recognize the right of the Council to question him on the facts
      of his private life. That was an answer of one sort, certainly. Inevitably
      it would result in his being stricken from the roll of the barristers of
      the Royal courts; but, at least, it had an air of dignity and protestation
      which saved, in a measure, his self-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he wrote a letter to Thuillier, in which he said that his visit
      to du Portail had resulted in his being obliged to accept another
      marriage. He therefore returned to Thuillier his promise, and took back
      his own. All this was curtly said, without the slightest expression of
      regret for the marriage he renounced. In a postscript he added: &ldquo;We shall
      be obliged to discuss my position on the newspaper,&rdquo;&mdash;indicating that
      it might enter into his plans not to retain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was careful to make a copy of this letter, and an hour later, when, in
      Corentin&rsquo;s study, he was questioned as to the result of his night&rsquo;s
      reflections, he gave that great general, for all answer, the matrimonial
      resignation he had just despatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Corentin. &ldquo;But as for your position on the newspaper,
      you may perhaps have to keep it for a time. The candidacy of that fool
      interferes with the plans of the government, and we must manage in some
      way to trip up the heels of the municipal councillor. In your position as
      editor-in-chief you may find a chance to do it, and I think your
      conscience won&rsquo;t kick at the mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;the thought of the humiliations to which I
      have been so long subjected will make it a precious joy to lash that
      bourgeois brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;you are young, and you must watch against
      those revengeful emotions. In our austere profession we love nothing and
      we hate nothing. Men are to us mere pawns of wood or ivory, according to
      their quality&mdash;with which we play our game. We are like the blade
      that cuts what is given it to cut, but, careful only to be delicately
      sharpened, wishes neither harm nor good to any one. Now let us speak of
      your cousin, to whom, I suppose, you have some curiosity to be presented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was not obliged to pretend to eagerness, that which he felt was
      genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydie de la Peyrade,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;is nearly thirty, but her
      innocence, joined to a gentle form of insanity, has kept her apart from
      all those passions, ideas, and impressions which use up life, and has, if
      I may say so, embalmed her in a sort of eternal youth. You would not think
      her more than twenty. She is fair and slender; her face, which is very
      delicate, is especially remarkable for an expression of angelic sweetness.
      Deprived of her full reason by a terrible catastrophe, her monomania has
      something touching about it. She always carries in her arms or keeps
      beside her a bundle of linen which she nurses and cares for as though it
      were a sick child; and, excepting Bruneau and myself, whom she recognizes,
      she thinks all other men are doctors, whom she consults about the child,
      and to whom she listens as oracles. A crisis which lately happened in her
      malady has convinced Horace Bianchon, that prince of science, that if the
      reality could be substituted for this long delusion of motherhood, her
      reason would assert itself. It is surely a worthy task to bring back light
      to a soul in which it is scarcely veiled; and the existing bond of
      relationship has seemed to me to point you out as specially designated to
      effect this cure, the success of which Bianchon and two other eminent
      doctors who have consulted with him declare to be beyond a doubt. Now, I
      will take you to Lydie&rsquo;s presence; remember to play the part of doctor;
      for the only thing that makes her lose her customary serenity is not to
      enter into her notion of medical consultation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After crossing several rooms Corentin was on the point of taking la
      Peyrade into that usually occupied by Lydie when employed in cradling or
      dandling her imaginary child, when suddenly they were stopped by the sound
      of two or three chords struck by the hand of a master on a piano of the
      finest sonority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Lydie,&rdquo; replied Corentin, with what might be called an expression
      of paternal pride; &ldquo;she is an admirable musician, and though she no longer
      writes down, as in the days when her mind was clear, her delightful
      melodies, she often improvises them in a way that moves me to the soul&mdash;the
      soul of Corentin!&rdquo; added the old man, smiling. &ldquo;Is not that the finest
      praise I can bestow upon her? But suppose we sit down here and listen to
      her. If we go in, the concert will cease and the medical consultation
      begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade was amazed as he listened to an improvisation in which the rare
      union of inspiration and science opened to his impressionable nature a
      source of emotions as deep as they were unexpected. Corentin watched the
      surprise which from moment to moment the Provencal expressed by admiring
      exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hein! how she plays!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Liszt himself hasn&rsquo;t a firmer
      touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To a very quick &ldquo;scherzo&rdquo; the performer now added the first notes of an
      &ldquo;adagio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is going to sing,&rdquo; said Corentin, recognizing the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she sing too?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Pasta, like Malibran; but hush, listen to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few opening bars in &ldquo;arpeggio&rdquo; a vibrant voice resounded, the
      tones of which appeared to stir the Provencal to the depths of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the music moves you!&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;you were undoubtedly made for
      each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! the same air! the same voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you already met Lydie somewhere?&rdquo; asked the great master of the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I think not,&rdquo; answered la Peyrade, in a stammering
      voice; &ldquo;in any case, it was long ago&mdash;But that air&mdash;that voice&mdash;I
      think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go in,&rdquo; said Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the door abruptly, he entered, pulling the young man after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting with her back to the door, and prevented by the sound of the piano
      from hearing what happened behind her, Lydie did not notice their
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now have you any remembrance of her?&rdquo; said Corentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade advanced a step, and no sooner had he caught a glimpse of the
      girl&rsquo;s profile than he threw up his hands above his head, striking them
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing his cry, Lydie turned round, and fixing her attention on Corentin,
      she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How naughty and troublesome you are to come and disturb me; you know very
      well I don&rsquo;t like to be listened to. Ah! but&mdash;&rdquo; she added, catching
      sight of la Peyrade&rsquo;s black coat, &ldquo;you have brought the doctor; that is
      very kind of you; I was just going to ask you to send for him. The baby
      has done nothing but cry since morning; I was singing to put her to sleep,
      but nothing can do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she ran to fetch what she called her child from a corner of the room,
      where with two chairs laid on their backs and the cushions of the sofa,
      she had constructed a sort of cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went towards la Peyrade, carrying her precious bundle with one
      hand, with the other she was arranging the imaginary cap of her &ldquo;little
      darling,&rdquo; having no eyes except for the sad creation of her disordered
      brain. Step by step, as she advanced, la Peyrade, pale, trembling, and
      with staring eyes, retreated backwards, until he struck against a seat,
      into which, losing his equilibrium, he fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of Corentin&rsquo;s power and experience, and who, moreover, knew to its
      slightest detail the horrible drama in which Lydie had lost her reason,
      had already, of course, taken in the situation, but it suited his purpose
      and his ideas to allow the clear light of evidence to pierce this
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, doctor,&rdquo; said Lydie, unfastening the bundle, and putting the pins
      in her mouth as she did so, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that she is growing thinner
      every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade could not answer; he kept his handkerchief over his face, and
      his breath came so fast from his chest that he was totally unable to utter
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with one of those gestures of feverish impatience, to which her
      mental state predisposed her, she exclaimed, hastily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at her doctor, look!&rdquo; taking his arm violently and forcing him
      to show his features. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she cried, when she had looked him in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting fall the linen bundle in her arms, she threw herself hastily
      backwards, and her eyes grew haggard. Passing her white hands rapidly over
      her forehead and through her hair, tossing it into disorder, she seemed to
      be making an effort to obtain from her memory some dormant recollection.
      Then, like a frightened mare, which comes to smell an object that has
      given it a momentary terror, she approached la Peyrade slowly, stooping to
      look into his face, which he kept lowered, while, in the midst of a
      silence inexpressible, she examined him steadily for several seconds.
      Suddenly a terrible cry escaped her breast; she ran for refuge into the
      arms of Corentin, and pressing herself against him with all her force, she
      exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me! save me! It is he! the wretch! It is he who did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with her finger pointed at la Peyrade, she seemed to nail the
      miserable object of her terror to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this explosion, she muttered a few disconnected words, and her eyes
      closed; Corentin felt the relaxing of all the muscles by which she had
      held him as in a vice the moment before, and he took her in his arms and
      laid her on the sofa, insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not stay here, monsieur,&rdquo; said Corentin. &ldquo;Go into my study; I will
      come to you presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, after giving Lydie into the care of Katte and
      Bruneau, and despatching Perrache for Doctor Bianchon, Corentin rejoined
      la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see now, monsieur,&rdquo; he said with solemnity, &ldquo;that in pursuing with a
      sort of passion the idea of this marriage, I was following, in a sense,
      the ways of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, with compunction, &ldquo;I will confess to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Useless,&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;you can tell me nothing that I do not know; I,
      on the contrary, have much to tell you. Old Peyrade, your uncle, in the
      hope of earning a POT for this daughter whom he idolized, entered into a
      dangerous private enterprise, the nature of which I need not explain. In
      it he made enemies; enemies who stopped at nothing,&mdash;murder, poison,
      rape. To paralyze your uncle&rsquo;s action by attacking him in his dearest
      spot, Lydie was, not abducted, but enticed from her home and taken to a
      house apparently respectable, where for ten days she was kept concealed.
      She was not much alarmed by this detention, being told that it was done at
      her father&rsquo;s wish, and she spent her time with her music&mdash;you
      remember, monsieur, how she sang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade, covering his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you yesterday that you might perhaps have more upon your
      conscience than the Thuillier house. But you were young; you had just come
      from your province, with that brutality, that frenzy of Southern blood in
      your veins which flings itself upon such an occasion. Besides, your
      relationship became known to those who were preparing the ruin of this new
      Clarissa Harlowe, and I am willing to believe than an abler and better man
      than you might not have escaped the entanglement into which you fell.
      Happily, Providence has granted that there is nothing absolutely
      irreparable in this horrible history. The same poison, according to the
      use that is made of it, may give either death or health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;shall I not always be to her an object
      of horror?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, monsieur,&rdquo; said Katte, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mademoiselle Lydie?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very calm,&rdquo; replied Katte. &ldquo;Just now, when we put her to bed,&mdash;though
      she did not want to go, saying she felt well,&mdash;I took her the bundle
      of linen, but she told me to take it away, and asked what I meant her to
      do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Corentin, grasping the Provencal&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;you are the
      lance of Achilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he left the room with Katte to receive Doctor Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Theodose was a prey to thoughts which may perhaps be imagined.
      After a while the door opened, and Bruneau, the old valet, ushered in
      Cerizet. Seeing la Peyrade, the latter exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! I knew it! I knew you would end by seeing du Portail. And the
      marriage,&mdash;how does that come on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that concerns you; or rather, something that we must do
      together. Du Portail, who is too busy to attend to business just now, has
      sent me in here to see you, and consult as to the best means of putting a
      spoke in Thuillier&rsquo;s election; it seems that the government is determined
      to prevent his winning it. Have you any ideas about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied la Peyrade; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t feel in the mood just now to be
      imaginative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the situation,&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;The government has another
      candidate, which it doesn&rsquo;t yet produce, because the ministerial
      negotiations with him have been rather difficult. During this time
      Thuillier&rsquo;s chances have been making headway. Minard, on whom they counted
      to create a diversion, sits, the stupid fool, in his corner; the seizure
      of that pamphlet has given your blockhead of a protege a certain perfume
      of popularity. In short, the ministry are afraid he&rsquo;ll be elected, and
      nothing could be more disagreeable to them. Pompous imbeciles, like
      Thuillier, are horribly embarrassing in the Opposition; they are pitchers
      without handles; you can&rsquo;t take hold of them anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Cerizet,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, beginning to assume a protecting
      tone, and wishing to discover his late associate&rsquo;s place in Corentin&rsquo;s
      confidence, &ldquo;you seem to know a good deal about the secret intentions of
      the government; have you found your way to a certain desk in the rue de
      Grenelle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. All that I tell you,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I get from du Portail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, lowering his voice, &ldquo;who <i>is</i> du Portail?
      You seem to have known him for some time. A man of your force ought to
      have discovered the real character of a man who seems to me to be rather
      mysterious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;du Portail is a pretty strong man. He&rsquo;s an
      old slyboots, who has had some post, I fancy, in the administration of the
      national domain, or something of that kind, under government; in which, I
      think, he must have been employed in the departments suppressed under the
      Empire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I think he made his money,&rdquo; continued Cerizet; &ldquo;and being a
      shrewd old fellow, and having a natural daughter to marry, he has
      concocted this philanthropic tale of her being the daughter of an old
      friend named Peyrade; and your name being the same may have given him the
      idea of fastening upon you&mdash;for, after all, he has to marry her to
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well; but his close relations with the government,
      and the interest he takes in elections, how do you explain all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally enough,&rdquo; replied Cerizet. &ldquo;Du Portail is a man who loves money,
      and likes to handle it; he has done Rastignac, that great manipulator of
      elections, who is, I think, his compatriot, several signal services as an
      amateur; Rastignac, in return, gives him information, obtained through
      Nucingen, which enables him to gamble at the Bourse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he himself tell you all this?&rdquo; asked la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; returned Cerizet. &ldquo;With that worthy old fellow,
      from whom I have already wormed a promise of thirty thousand francs, I
      play the ninny; I flatten myself to nothing. But I&rsquo;ve made Bruneau talk,
      that old valet of his. You can safely ally yourself to his family, my dear
      fellow; du Portail is powerfully rich; he&rsquo;ll get you made sub-prefect
      somewhere; and thence to a prefecture and a fortune is but one step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for the information,&rdquo; said la Peyrade; &ldquo;at least, I shall know on
      which foot to hop. But you yourself, how came you to know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s quite a history; by my help he was able to get back a lot of
      diamonds which had been stolen from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Corentin entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; he said to la Peyrade. &ldquo;There are signs of returning
      reason. Bianchon, to whom I have told all, wishes to confer with you;
      therefore, my dear Monsieur Cerizet, we will postpone until this evening,
      if you are willing, our little study over the Thuillier election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so here you have him, at last!&rdquo; said Cerizet, slapping la Peyrade&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;and you know what I promised; you may rely on
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cerizet departed joyful.

      CHAPTER XVI. CHECKMATE TO THUILLIER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after that evening, when Corentin, la Peyrade, and Cerizet were to
      have had their consultation in reference to the attack on Thuillier&rsquo;s
      candidacy, the latter was discussing with his sister Brigitte the letter
      in which Theodose declined the hand of Celeste, and his mind seemed
      particularly to dwell on the postscript where it was intimated that la
      Peyrade might not continue the editor of the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre.&rdquo; At this
      moment Henri, the &ldquo;male domestic,&rdquo; entered the room to ask if his master
      would receive Monsieur Cerizet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier&rsquo;s first impulse was to deny himself to that unwelcome visitor.
      Then, thinking better of it, he reflected that if la Peyrade suddenly left
      him in the lurch, Cerizet might possibly prove a precious resource.
      Consequently, he ordered Henri to show him in. His manner, however, was
      extremely cold, and in some sort expectant. As for Cerizet, he presented
      himself without the slightest embarrassment and with the air of a man who
      had calculated all the consequences of the step he was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear monsieur,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I suppose by this time you have been
      posted as to the Sieur la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may you mean by that?&rdquo; said Thuillier, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the man,&rdquo; replied Cerizet, &ldquo;who, after intriguing to marry your
      goddaughter, breaks off the marriage abruptly&mdash;as he will, before
      long, break that lion&rsquo;s-share contract he made you sign about his
      editorship&mdash;can&rsquo;t be, I should suppose, the object of the same blind
      confidence you formerly reposed in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Thuillier, hastily, &ldquo;then do you know anything about la
      Peyrade&rsquo;s intention of leaving the newspaper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;on the terms I now am with him, you can readily
      believe we don&rsquo;t see each other; still less should I receive his
      confidences. But I draw the induction from the well-known character of the
      person, and you may be sure that when he finds it for his interest to
      leave you, he&rsquo;ll throw you away like an old coat&mdash;I&rsquo;ve passed that
      way, and I speak from experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must have had some difficulties with him before you joined my
      paper?&rdquo; said Thuillier, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; replied Cerizet; &ldquo;the affair of this house which he helped you
      to buy was mine; I started that hare. He was to put me in relation with
      you, and make me the principal tenant of the house. But the unfortunate
      affair of that bidding-in gave him a chance to knock me out of everything
      and get all the profits for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Profits!&rdquo; exclaimed Thuillier. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that he got anything out of
      that transaction, except the marriage which he now refuses&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Cerizet, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the ten thousand francs he got out of
      you on pretence of the cross which you never received, and the twenty-five
      thousand he owes to Madame Lambert, for which you went security, and which
      you will soon have to pay like a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear?&rdquo; cried Brigitte, up in arms; &ldquo;twenty-five thousand
      francs for which you have given security?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; interposed Cerizet; &ldquo;behind that sum which this woman
      had lent him there was a mystery, and if I had not laid my hand on the
      true explanation, there would certainly have been a very dirty ending to
      it. La Peyrade was clever enough not only to whitewash himself in Monsieur
      Thuillier&rsquo;s eyes, but to get him to secure the debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;how do you know that I did give security for that
      debt, if you have not seen him since then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it from the woman herself, who tells the whole story now she is
      certain of being paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Brigitte to her brother, &ldquo;a pretty business you are engaged
      in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Cerizet, &ldquo;I only meant to warn Monsieur Thuillier a
      little. I think myself that you are sure to be paid. Without knowing the
      exact particulars of this new marriage, I am certain the family would
      never allow him to owe you to such mortifying debts; if necessary, I
      should be very glad to intervene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Thuillier, stiffly, &ldquo;thanking you for your officious
      intervention, permit me to say that it surprises me a little, for the
      manner in which we parted would not have allowed me to hope it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca!&rdquo; said Cerizet; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think I was angry with you for that, do
      you? I pitied you, that was all. I saw you under the spell, and I said to
      myself: &lsquo;Leave him to learn la Peyrade by experience.&rsquo; I knew very well
      that the day of justice would dawn for me, and before long, too. La
      Peyrade is a man who doesn&rsquo;t make you wait for his questionable
      proceedings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to say,&rdquo; remarked Thuillier, &ldquo;that I do not consider the rupture
      of the marriage we had proposed a questionable proceeding. The matter was
      arranged, I may say, by mutual consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the trick he is going to play you by leaving the paper in the lurch,
      and the debt he has saddled you with, what are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Cerizet,&rdquo; continued Thuillier, still holding himself on the
      reserve, &ldquo;as I have said more than once to la Peyrade, no man is
      indispensable; and if the editorship of my paper becomes vacant, I feel
      confident that I shall at once meet with persons very eager to offer me
      their services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it for me you say that?&rdquo; asked Cerizet. &ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t hit the
      nail; if you did me the honor to want my services it would be impossible
      for me to grant them. I have long been disgusted with journalism. I let la
      Peyrade, I hardly know why, persuade me to make this campaign with you; it
      didn&rsquo;t turn out happily, and I have vowed to myself to have no more to do
      with newspapers. It was about another matter altogether than I came to
      speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Cerizet, &ldquo;remembering the business-like manner in which
      you managed the affair of this house in which you do me the honor to
      receive me, I thought I could not do better than to call your attention to
      a matter of the same kind which I have just now in hand. But I shall not
      do as la Peyrade did,&mdash;make a bargain for the hand of your
      goddaughter, and profess great friendship and devotion to you personally.
      This is purely business, and I expect to make my profit out of it. Now, as
      I still desire to become the principal tenant of this house,&mdash;the
      letting of which must be a care and a disappointment to mademoiselle, for
      I saw as I came along that the shops were still unrented,&mdash;I think
      that this lease to me, if you will make it, might be reckoned in to my
      share of the profits. You see, monsieur, that the object of my visit has
      nothing to do with the newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this new affair?&rdquo; said Brigitte; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the first thing to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It relates to a farm in Beauce, which has just been sold for a song, and
      it is placed in my hands to resell, at an advance, but a small one; you
      could really buy it, as the saying is, for a bit of bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cerizet went on to explain the whole mechanism of the affair, which we
      need not relate here, as no one but Brigitte would take any interest in
      it. The statement was clear and precise, and it took close hold on the old
      maid&rsquo;s mind. Even Thuillier himself, in spite of his inward distrust, was
      obliged to own that the affair had all the appearance of a good
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;we must first see the farm ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, the reader will remember, was her answer to la Peyrade when he first
      proposed the purchase of the house at the Madeleine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier than that,&rdquo; said Cerizet. &ldquo;I myself want to see it, and
      I have been intending to make a little excursion there. If you like, I&rsquo;ll
      be at your door this afternoon with a post-chaise, and to-morrow morning,
      very early, we can examine the farm, breakfast at some inn near by, and be
      back in time for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A post-chaise!&rdquo; said Brigitte, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very lordly; why not take the
      diligence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diligences are so uncertain,&rdquo; replied Cerizet; &ldquo;you never know at what
      time they will get to a place. But you need not think about the expense,
      for I should otherwise go alone, and I am only too happy to offer you two
      seats in my carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To misers, small gains are often determining causes in great matters;
      after a little resistance &ldquo;pro forma,&rdquo; Brigitte ended by accepting the
      proposal, and three hours later the trio were on the road to Chartres,
      Cerizet having advised Thuillier not to let la Peyrade know of his
      absence, lest he might take some unfair advantage of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, by five o&rsquo;clock, the party had returned, and the brother and
      sister, who kept their opinions to themselves in presence of Cerizet, were
      both agreed that the purchase was a good one. They had found the soil of
      the best quality, the buildings in perfect repair, the cattle looked sound
      and healthy; in short, this idea of becoming the mistress of rural
      property seemed to Brigitte the final consecration of opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minard,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;has only a town-house and invested capital,
      whereas we shall have all that and a country-place besides; one can&rsquo;t be
      really rich without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier was not sufficiently under the charm of that dream&mdash;the
      realization of which was, in any case, quite distant&mdash;to forget, even
      for a moment, the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre&rdquo; and his candidacy. No sooner had he
      reached home than he asked for the morning&rsquo;s paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not come,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;male domestic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine distribution, when even the owner of the paper is not
      served!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was nearly dinner-time, and after his journey he would much
      rather have taken a bath than rush to the rue Saint-Dominique, Thuillier
      ordered a cab and drove at once to the office of the &ldquo;Echo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There a fresh disappointment met him. The paper &ldquo;was made,&rdquo; as they say,
      and all the employees had departed, even la Peyrade. As for Coffinet, who
      was not to be found at his post of office-boy, nor yet at his other post
      of porter, he had gone &ldquo;of an errand,&rdquo; his wife said, taking the key of
      the closet in which the remaining copies of the paper were locked up.
      Impossible, therefore, to procure the number which the unfortunate
      proprietor had come so far to fetch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe Thuillier&rsquo;s indignation would be impossible. He marched up and
      down the room, talking aloud to himself, as people do in moments of
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn them all out!&rdquo; he cried. And we are forced to omit the rest of
      the furious objurgation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ended his anathema a rap was heard on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Thuillier, in a tone that depicted his wrath and his
      frantic impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Minard rushed precipitately into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good, my excellent friend!&rdquo; cried the mayor of the eleventh
      arrondissement, concluding his embrace with a hearty shake of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what is it?&rdquo; said Thuillier, unable to comprehend the warmth of this
      demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear friend,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;such an admirable proceeding!
      really chivalrous! most disinterested! The effect, I assure you, is quite
      stupendous in the arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, I say?&rdquo; cried Thuillier, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The article, the whole action,&rdquo; continued Minard, &ldquo;so noble, so
      elevated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what article? what action?&rdquo; said the proprietor of the &ldquo;Echo,&rdquo;
       getting quite beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The article of this morning,&rdquo; said Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The article of this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! did you write it when you were asleep; or, like Monsieur Jourdain
      doing prose, do you do heroism without knowing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I haven&rsquo;t written any article!&rdquo; cried Thuillier. &ldquo;I have been away
      from Paris for a day, and I don&rsquo;t even know what is in this morning&rsquo;s
      paper; and the office-boy is not here to give me a copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one,&rdquo; said Minard, pulling the much desired paper from his pocket.
      &ldquo;If the article is not years you have certainly inspired it; in any case,
      the deed is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier hurriedly unfolded the sheet Minard had given him, and devoured
      rather than read the following article:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Long enough has the proprietor of this regenerated journal
  submitted without complaint and without reply to the cowardly
  insinuations with which a venal press insults all citizens who,
  strong in their convictions, refuse to pass beneath the Caudine
  Forks of power. Long enough has a man, who has already given
  proofs of devotion and abnegation in the important functions of
  the aedility of Paris, allowed these sheets to call him ambitious
  and self-seeking. Monsieur Jerome Thuillier, strong in his
  dignity, has suffered such coarse attacks to pass him with
  contempt. Encouraged by this disdainful silence, the stipendiaries
  of the press have dared to write that this journal, a work of
  conviction and of the most disinterested patriotism, was but the
  stepping-stone of a man, the speculation of a seeker for election.
  Monsieur Jerome Thuillier has held himself impassible before these
  shameful imputations because justice and truth are patient, and he
  bided his time to scotch the reptile. That time has come.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That deuce of a Peyrade!&rdquo; said Thuillier, stopping short; &ldquo;how he does
      touch it off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is magnificent!&rdquo; cried Minard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading aloud, Thuillier continued:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Every one, friends and enemies alike, can bear witness that
  Monsieur Jerome Thuillier has done nothing to seek a candidacy
  which was offered to him spontaneously.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo; said Thuillier, interrupting himself. Then he resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  But, since his sentiments are so odiously misrepresented, and his
  intentions so falsely travestied, Monsieur Jerome Thuillier owes
  it to himself, and above all to the great national party of which
  he is the humblest soldier, to give an example which shall
  confound the vile sycophants of power.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fine, the way la Peyrade poses me!&rdquo; said Thuillier, pausing once
      more in his reading. &ldquo;I see now why he didn&rsquo;t send me the paper; he wanted
      to enjoy my surprise&mdash;&lsquo;confound the vile sycophants of power!&rsquo; how
      fine that is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After which reflection, he continued:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Monsieur Thuillier was so far from founding this journal of
  dynastic opposition to support and promote his election that, at
  the very moment when the prospects of that election seem most
  favorable to himself and most disastrous to his rivals, he here
  declares publicly, and in the most formal, absolute, and
  irrevocable manner that he <i>renounces his candidacy</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Thuillier, thinking he had read wrong, or had misunderstood
      what he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; said the mayor of the eleventh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Thuillier, with a bewildered air, seemed not disposed to continue
      his reading, Minard took the paper from his hands and read the rest of the
      article himself, beginning where the other had left off:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Renounces his candidacy; and he strongly urges the electors to
  transfer to Monsieur Minard, mayor of the eleventh arrondissement
  and his friend and colleague in his municipal functions, all the
  votes with which they seemed about to honor him.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is infamous!&rdquo; cried Thuillier, recovering his speech; &ldquo;you have
      bought that Jesuit la Peyrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Minard, stupefied by Thuillier&rsquo;s attitude, &ldquo;the article was not
      agreed upon between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretch has profited by my absence to slip it into the paper; I
      understand now why he prevented a copy from reaching me to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;what you tell me will seem incredible to
      the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it is treachery; it is an abominable trap. Renounce my
      candidacy!&mdash;why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;that I am truly sorry if
      your confidence has been abused, but I have just issued my circular
      manifesto; the die is cast, and luck to the lucky now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;it is a comedy for which you have paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Thuillier,&rdquo; said Minard, in a threatening voice, &ldquo;I advise you
      not to repeat those words, unless you are ready to give me satisfaction
      for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily for Thuillier, who, we may remember, had made his profession of
      faith as to civic courage some time before, he was relieved from answering
      by Coffinet, who now opened the door of the editorial sanctum, and
      announced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs the electors of the twelfth arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The arrondissement was represented on this occasion by five persons. An
      apothecary, chairman of the deputation, proceeded to address Thuillier in
      the following terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come, monsieur, after taking cognizance of an article inserted
      this morning in the &lsquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rsquo; to inquire of you what may be
      precisely the origin and bearing of that article; thinking it incredible
      that, having solicited our suffrages, you should, on the eve of this
      election, and from a most mistaken puritanism, have cast disorder and
      disunion into our ranks, and probably have caused the triumph of the
      ministerial candidate. A candidate does not belong to himself; he belongs
      to the electors who have promised to honor him with their votes. But,&rdquo;
       continued the orator, casting his eye at Minard, &ldquo;the presence in these
      precincts of the candidate whom you have gone out of your way to recommend
      to us, indicates that between you and him there is connivance; and I have
      no need to ask who is being here deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, messieurs, no,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;I have not renounced my candidacy.
      That article was written and printed without my knowledge or consent.
      To-morrow you will see the denial of it in the same paper, and you will
      also learn that the infamous person who has betrayed my confidence is no
      longer the editor of this journal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the orator of the deputation, &ldquo;in spite of your declaration
      to the contrary, you do continue to be the candidate of the Opposition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, messieurs, until death; and I beg you to use your utmost influence
      in the quarter to neutralize the effect of this deliberate falsehood until
      I am able to officially present the most formal disavowal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said the electors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, as for the presence of Monsieur Minard, my competitor, in these
      precincts, I have not invited it; and at the moment when you entered this
      room, I was engaged in a very sharp and decided explanation with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said the electors again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after cordially shaking the hand of the apothecary, Thuillier
      conducted the deputation to the outer door of the apartment; after which,
      returning to the editorial sanctum, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Minard, I withdraw the words which wounded you; but you can see
      now what justification I had for my indignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Coffinet again opened the door and announced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs the electors of the eleventh arrondissement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The arrondissement was represented this time by seven persons. A
      linen-draper, chairman of the delegation, addressed Thuillier in the
      following speech:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, it is with sincere admiration that we have learned this morning
      from the columns of your paper, the great civic act by which you have
      touched all hearts. You have shown, in thus retiring, a most unusual
      disinterestedness, and the esteem of your fellow-citizens&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Thuillier, interrupting him, &ldquo;I cannot allow you to
      continue; the article about which you are so good as to congratulate me,
      was inserted by mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the linen-draper; &ldquo;then do you not retire? Can you suppose
      that in opposition to the candidacy of Monsieur Minard (whose presence in
      these precincts seems to me rather singular) you have the slightest chance
      of success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Thuillier, &ldquo;have the goodness to request the electors of
      your arrondissement to await the issue of to-morrow&rsquo;s paper, in which I
      shall furnish categorical explanations of the most distinct character. The
      article to-day is the result of a misunderstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a sad pity, monsieur,&rdquo; said the linen-draper, &ldquo;if you lose
      this occasion to place yourself in the eyes of your fellow-citizens beside
      the Washingtons and other great men of antiquity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say again, <i>to-morrow</i>, messieurs,&rdquo; said Thuillier. &ldquo;I am none the
      less sensible to the honor you do me, and I trust that when you know the
      whole truth, I shall not suffer in your esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty queer mess this seems to be,&rdquo; said the voice of an elector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;it looks as if they meant to bamboozle us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, messieurs!&rdquo; cried the chairman, putting a stop to the
      outbreak; &ldquo;to-morrow&mdash;we will wait until to-morrow for the promised
      explanations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, the deputation retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not likely that Thuillier would have accompanied them beyond the
      door of the sanctum, but in any case he was prevented by the sudden
      entrance of la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just come from your house, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said the Provencal;
      &ldquo;they told me I should find you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come, doubtless, for the purpose of explaining to me the strange
      article you allowed yourself to insert in my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said la Peyrade. &ldquo;The remarkable man whom you know, and whose
      powerful influence you have already felt, confided to me yesterday, in
      your interests, the plans of the government, and I saw at once that your
      defeat was inevitable. I wished therefore to secure to you an honorable
      and dignified retreat. There was no time to lose; you were absent from
      Paris, and therefore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, monsieur,&rdquo; said Thuillier; &ldquo;but you will take notice that from
      the present moment you are no longer the editor of this paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I came to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you also came to settle the little account we have together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; said Minard, &ldquo;I see that this is a business interview; I
      shall therefore take leave of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Minard had left the room, la Peyrade pulled out his
      pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are ten thousand francs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which I will beg you to remit to
      Mademoiselle Brigitte; and here, also, is the bond by which you secured
      the payment of twenty-five thousand francs to Madame Lambert; that sum I
      have now paid in full, and here is the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, monsieur,&rdquo; said Thuillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade bowed and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serpent!&rdquo; said Thuillier as he watched him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cerizet said the right thing,&rdquo; thought la Peyrade,&mdash;&ldquo;a pompous
      imbecile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blow struck at Thuillier&rsquo;s candidacy was mortal, but Minard did not
      profit by it. While the pair were contending for votes, a government man,
      an aide-de-camp to the king, arrived with his hands full of tobacco
      licenses and other electoral small change, and, like the third thief, he
      slipped between the two who were thumping each other, and carried off the
      booty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that Brigitte did not get her farm in Beauce. That
      was only a mirage, by help of which Thuillier was enticed out of Paris
      long enough for la Peyrade to deal his blow,&mdash;a service rendered to
      the government on the one hand, but also a precious vengeance for the many
      humiliations he had undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thuillier had certainly some suspicions as to the complicity of Cerizet,
      but that worthy managed to justify himself; and by manoeuvring the sale of
      the &ldquo;Echo de la Bievre,&rdquo; now become a nightmare to the luckless owner, he
      ended by appearing as white as snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper was secretly bought up by Corentin, and the late opposition
      sheet became a &ldquo;canard&rdquo; sold on Sundays in the wine-shops and concocted in
      the dens of the police.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS FUNCTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      About two months after the scene in which la Peyrade had been convinced
      that through a crime of his past life his future was irrevocably settled,
      he (being now married to his victim, who was beginning to have lucid
      intervals, though the full return of her reason would not take place until
      the occasion indicated by the doctors) was sitting one morning with the
      head of the police in the latter&rsquo;s office. Taking part in the work of the
      department, the young man was serving an apprenticeship under that great
      master in the difficult and delicate functions to which he was henceforth
      riveted. But Corentin found that his pupil did not bring to this
      initiation all the ardor and amiability that he desired. It was plain that
      in la Peyrade&rsquo;s soul there was a sense of forfeiture and degradation; time
      would get the better of that impression, but the callus was not yet
      formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening a number of sealed envelopes enclosing the reports of his various
      agents, Corentin glanced over these documents, seldom as useful as the
      public suppose, casting them one after another contemptuously into a
      basket, whence they issued in a mass for a burning. But to one of them the
      great man evidently gave some particular attention; as he read it a smile
      flickered on his lips, and when he had finished, instead of adding it to
      the pile in the basket, he gave it to la Peyrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something that concerns you; it shows that in our
      profession, which just now seems to you unpleasantly serious, we do
      occasionally meet with comedies. Read it aloud; it will cheer me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before la Peyrade began to read, Corentin added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to tell you that the report is from a man called Henri, whom
      Madame Komorn introduced as man-servant at the Thuilliers&rsquo;; you probably
      remember him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said la Peyrade, &ldquo;servants placed in families! is that one of your
      methods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; replied Corentin; &ldquo;in order to know all, we must use all
      means. But a great many lies are told about us on that subject. It is not
      true that the police, making a system of it, has, at certain periods, by a
      general enrolment of lacqueys and lady&rsquo;s-maids, established a vast network
      in private families. Nothing is fixed and absolute in our manner of
      proceeding; we act in accordance with the time and circumstances. I wanted
      an ear and an influence in the Thuillier household; accordingly, I let
      loose the Godollo upon it, and she, in turn, partly to assist herself,
      installed there one of our men, an intelligent fellow, as you will see for
      yourself. But for all that, if, at another time, a servant came and
      offered to sell me the secrets of his master, I should have him arrested,
      and let a warning reach the ears of the family to distrust the other
      servants. Now go on, and read that report.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Monsieur the Director of the Secret Police,
</pre>
    <p>
      read la Peyrade aloud,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I did not stay long with the little baron; he is a man wholly
  occupied in frivolous pleasures; and there was nothing to be
  gathered there that was worthy of a report to you. I have found
  another place, where I have already witnessed several thing which
  fit into the mission that Madame de Godollo gave me, and
  therefore, thinking them likely to interest you, I hasten to bring
  them to your knowledge. The household in which I am now employed
  is that of an old savant, named Monsieur Picot, who lives on a
  first floor, Place de la Madeleine, in the house and apartment
  formerly occupied by my late masters, the Thuilliers&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried la Peyrade, interrupting his reading, &ldquo;Pere Picot, that
      ruined old lunatic, occupying such an apartment as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on!&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;life is full of many strange things.
      You&rsquo;ll find the explanation farther along; for our correspondent&mdash;it
      is the defect of those fellows to waste themselves on details&mdash;is
      only too fond of dotting his i&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Peyrade read on:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The Thuilliers left this apartment some weeks ago to return to
  their Latin quarter. Mademoiselle Brigitte never really liked our
  sphere; her total want of education made her ill at ease. Just
  because I speak correctly, she was always calling me &lsquo;the orator,&rsquo; 
  and she could not endure Monsieur Pascal, her porter, because,
  being beadle in the church of the Madeleine, he had manners; she
  even found something to say against the dealers in the great
  market behind the church, where, of course, she bought her
  provisions; she complained that they gave themselves <i>capable</i>
  airs, merely because they are not so coarse-tongued as those of
  the Halle, and only laughed at her when she tried to beat them
  down. She has leased the whole house to a certain Monsieur Cerizet
  (a very ugly man, with a nose all eaten away) for an annual rent of
  fifty-five thousand francs. This tenant seems to know what he is
  about. He has lately married an actress at one of the minor
  theatres, Mademoiselle Olympe Cardinal, and he was just about to
  occupy himself the first-floor apartment, where he proposed to
  establish his present business, namely, insurance for the &ldquo;dots&rdquo;
   of children, when Monsieur Picot, arriving from England with his
  wife, a very rich Englishwoman, saw the apartment and offered such
  a good price that Monsieur Cerizet felt constrained to take it.
  That was the time when, by the help of M. Pascal, the porter, with
  whom I have been careful to maintain good relations, I entered the
  household of Monsieur Picot.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Picot married to a rich Englishwoman!&rdquo; exclaimed la Peyrade,
      interrupting himself again; &ldquo;but it is incomprehensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, I tell you,&rdquo; said Corentin; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll comprehend it presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The fortune of my new master,
</pre>
    <p>
      continued la Peyrade,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  is quite a history; and I speak of it to Monsieur le directeur
  because another person in whom Madame de Godollo was interested
  has his marriage closely mixed up in it. That other person is
  Monsieur Felix Phellion, the inventor of a star, who, in despair
  at not being able to marry that demoiselle whom they wanted to
  give to the Sieur la Peyrade whom Madame de Godollo made such a
  fool of&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; said the Provencal, in a parenthesis. &ldquo;Is that how he speaks
      of me? He doesn&rsquo;t know who I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corentin laughed heartily and exhorted his pupil to read on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;who, in despair at not being able to marry that demoiselle . . .
  went to England in order to embark for a journey round the world
  &mdash;a lover&rsquo;s notion! Learning of this departure, Monsieur Picot,
  his former professor, who took great interest in his pupil, went
  after him to prevent that nonsense, which turned out not to be
  difficult. The English are naturally very jealous of discoveries,
  and when they saw Monsieur Phellion coming to embark at the heels
  of their own savants they asked him for his permit from the
  Admiralty; which, not having been provided, he could not produce;
  so then they laughed in his face and would not let him embark at
  all, fearing that he should prove more learned than they.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine hand at the &lsquo;entente cordiale,&rsquo; your Monsieur Henri,&rdquo; said
      la Peyrade, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Corentin; &ldquo;you will be struck, in the reports of nearly all
      our agents, with this general and perpetual inclination to calumniate. But
      what&rsquo;s to be done? For the trade of spies we can&rsquo;t have angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Left upon the shore, Telemachus and his mentor&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see our men are lettered,&rdquo; commented Corentin.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;Telemachus and his mentor thought best to return to France, and
  were about to do so when Monsieur Picot received a letter such as
  none but an Englishwoman could write. It told him that the writer
  had read his &ldquo;Theory of Perpetual Motion,&rdquo; and had also heard of
  his magnificent discovery of a star; that she regarded him as a
  genius only second to Newton, and that if the hand of her who
  addressed him, joined to eighty thousand pounds sterling&mdash;that is,
  two millions&mdash;of &ldquo;dot,&rdquo; was agreeable to him it was at his
  disposal. The first thought of the good man was to make his pupil
  marry her, but finding that impossible, he told her, before
  accepting on his own account, that he was old and three-quarters
  blind, and had never discovered a star, and did not own a penny.
  The Englishwoman replied that Milton was not young either, and was
  altogether blind; that Monsieur Picot seemed to her to have
  nothing worse than a cataract, for she knew all about it, being
  the daughter of a great oculist, and she would have him operated
  upon; that as for the star, she did not care so very much about
  that; it was the author of the &ldquo;Theory of Perpetual Motion&rdquo; who
  was the man of her dreams, and to whom she again offered her hand
  with eighty thousand pounds sterling (two millions) of &ldquo;dot.&rdquo;
   Monsieur Picot replied that if his sight were restored and she
  would consent to live in Paris, for he hated England, he would let
  himself be married. The operation was performed and was
  successful, and, at the end of three weeks the newly married pair
  arrived in the capital. These details I obtained from the lady&rsquo;s
  maid, with whom I am on the warmest terms.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the puppy!&rdquo; said Corentin, laughing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The above is therefore hearsay, but what remains to be told to
  Monsieur le directeur are facts of which I can speak &ldquo;de visu,&rdquo;
   and to which I am, consequently, in a position to certify. As
  soon as Monsieur and Madame Picot had installed themselves, which
  was done in the most sumptuous and comfortable manner, my master
  gave me a number of invitations to dinner to carry to the
  Thuillier family, the Colleville family, the Minard family, the
  Abbe Gondrin, vicar of the Madeleine, and nearly all the guests
  who were present at another dinner a few months earlier, when he
  had an encounter with Mademoiselle Thuillier, and behaved, I must
  say, in a rather singular manner. All the persons who received
  these invitations were so astonished to learn that the old man
  Picot had married a rich wife and was living in the Thuilliers&rsquo; 
  old apartment that most of them came to inquire of Monsieur
  Pascal, the porter, to see if they were hoaxed. The information
  they obtained being honest and honorable, the whole society
  arrived punctually on time; but Monsieur Picot did not appear.
  The guests were received by Madame Picot, who does not speak
  French and could only say, &ldquo;My husband is coming soon&rdquo;; after
  which, not being able to make further conversation, the company
  were dull and ill at ease. At last Monsieur Picot arrived, and all
  present were stupefied on seeing, instead of an old blind man,
  shabbily dressed, a handsome young elderly man, bearing his years
  jauntily, like Monsieur Ferville of the Gymnase, who said with a
  lively air:

  &ldquo;I beg your pardon, mesdames, for not being here at the moment of
  your arrival; but I was at the Academy of Sciences, awaiting the
  result of an election,&mdash;that of Monsieur Felix Phellion, who has
  been elected unanimously less three votes.&rdquo;
 
  This news seemed to have a great effect upon the company. So then
  Monsieur Picot resumed:&mdash;

  &ldquo;I must also, mesdames, ask your pardon for the rather improper
  manner in which I behaved a short time ago in the house where we
  are now assembled. My excuse must be my late infirmity, the
  annoyances of a family lawsuit, and of an old housekeeper who
  robbed me and tormented me in a thousand ways, from whom I am
  happily delivered. To-day you see me another man, rejuvenated and
  rich with the blessings bestowed upon me by the amiable woman who
  has given me her hand; and I should be in the happiest frame of
  mind to receive you if the recollection of my young friend, whose
  eminence as a man of science has just been consecrated by the
  Academy, did not cast upon my mind a veil of sadness. All here
  present,&rdquo; continued Monsieur Picot, raising his voice, which is
  rather loud, &ldquo;are guilty towards him: I, for ingratitude when he
  gave me the glory of his discovery and the reward of his immortal
  labors; that young lady, whom I see over there with tears in her
  eyes, for having foolishly accused him of atheism; that other
  lady, with the stern face, for having harshly replied to the
  proposals of his noble father, whose white hairs she ought rather
  to have honored; Monsieur Thuillier, for having sacrificed him to
  ambition; Monsieur Colleville, for not performing his part of
  father and choosing for his daughter the worthiest and most
  honorable man; Monsieur Minard, for having tried to foist his son
  into his place. There are but two persons in the room at this
  moment who have done him full justice,&mdash;Madame Thuillier and
  Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe Gondrin. Well, I shall now ask that man of God
  whether we can help doubting the divine justice when this generous
  young man, the victim of all of us, is, at the present hour, at
  the mercy of waves and tempests, to which for three long years he
  is consigned.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Providence is very powerful, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Abbe Gondrin.
  &ldquo;God will protect Monsieur Felix Phellion wherever he may be, and
  I have the firmest hope that three years hence he will be among
  his friends once more.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;But three years!&rdquo; said Monsieur Picot. &ldquo;Will it still be time?
  Will Mademoiselle Colleville have waited for him?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Yes, I swear it!&rdquo; cried the young girl, carried away by an
  impulse she could not control.

  Then she sat down again, quite ashamed, and burst into tears.

  &ldquo;And you, Mademoiselle Thuillier, and you, Madame Colleville, will
  you permit this young lady to reserve herself for one who is
  worthy of her?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; cried everybody; for Monsieur Picot&rsquo;s voice, which is
  very full and sonorous, seemed to have tears in it and affected
  everybody.

  &ldquo;Then it is time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to forgive Providence.&rdquo;
 
  And rushing suddenly to the door, where my ear was glued to the
  keyhole, he very nearly caught me.

  &ldquo;Announce,&rdquo; he said to me, in a very loud tone of voice, &ldquo;Monsieur
  Felix Phellion and his family.&rdquo;
 
  And thereupon the door of a side room opened, and five or six
  persons came out, who were led by Monsieur Picot into the salon.

  At the sight of her <i>lover</i>, Mademoiselle Colleville was taken ill,
  but the faint lasted only a minute; seeing Monsieur Felix at her
  feet she threw herself into Madame Thuillier&rsquo;s arms, crying out:&mdash;

  &ldquo;Godmother! you always told me to hope.&rdquo;
 
  Mademoiselle Thuillier, who, in spite of her harsh nature and want
  of education, I have always myself thought a remarkable woman, now
  had a fine impulse. As the company were about to go into the
  dining-room,&mdash;

  &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; she said.

  Then going up to Monsieur Phellion, senior, she said to him:

  &ldquo;Monsieur and old friend! I ask you for the hand of Monsieur Felix
  Phellion for our adopted daughter, Mademoiselle Colleville.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Bravo! bravo!&rdquo; they call cried in chorus.

  &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Monsieur Phellion, with tears in his eyes; &ldquo;what
  have I done to deserve such happiness?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;You have been an honest man and a Christian without knowing it,&rdquo;
   replied the Abbe Gondrin.
</pre>
    <p>
      Here la Peyrade flung down the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not finish it,&rdquo; said Corentin, taking back the paper. &ldquo;However,
      there&rsquo;s not much more. Monsieur Henri confesses to me that the scene had
      <i>moved him</i>; he also says that, knowing the interest I had formerly
      taken in the marriage, he thought he ought to inform me of its conclusion;
      ending with a slightly veiled suggestion of a fee. No, stay,&rdquo; resumed
      Corentin, &ldquo;here is a detail of some importance:&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The English woman seems to have made it known during dinner that,
  having no heirs, her fortune, after the lives of herself and her
  husband, will go to Felix. That will make him powerfully rich one
  of these days.
</pre>
    <p>
      La Peyrade had risen and was striding about the room with rapid steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Corentin, &ldquo;what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; said the great detective. &ldquo;I think you envy the
      happiness of that young man. My dear fellow, permit me to tell you that if
      such a conclusion were to your taste, you should have acted as he has
      done. When I sent you two thousand francs on which to study law, I did not
      intend you to succeed me; I expected you to row your galley laboriously,
      to have the needful courage for obscure and painful toil; your day would
      infallibly have come. But you chose to violate fortune&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean hasten it, reap it before it ripened. You flung yourself into
      journalism; then into business, questionable business; you made
      acquaintance with Messieurs Dutocq and Cerizet. Frankly, I think you
      fortunate to have entered the port which harbors you to-day. In any case,
      you are not sufficiently simple of heart to have really valued the joys
      reserved for Felix Phellion. These bourgeois&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These bourgeois,&rdquo; said la Peyrade, quickly,&mdash;&ldquo;I know them now. They
      have great absurdities, great vices even, but they have virtues, or, at
      the least, estimable qualities; in them lies the vital force of our
      corrupt society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> society!&rdquo; said Corentin, smiling; &ldquo;you speak as if you were
      still in the ranks. You have another sphere, my dear fellow; and you must
      learn to be more content with your lot. Governments pass, societies perish
      or dwindle; but we&mdash;<i>we</i> dominate all things; the police is
      eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>

  TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE

  Note.&mdash;This volume (&ldquo;Les Petits Bourgeois&rdquo;) was not published
  until 1854, more than three years after Balzac&rsquo;s death; although
  he says of it in March, 1844: &ldquo;I must tell you that my work
  entitled &lsquo;Les Petits Bourgeois,&rsquo; owing to difficulties of
  execution, requires still a month&rsquo;s labor, although the book is
  entirely written.&rdquo; And again, in October, 1846, he says: &ldquo;It is to
  such scruples&rdquo; (care in perfecting his work) &ldquo;that delays which
  have injured several of my works are due; for instance, &lsquo;Les
  Paysans,&rsquo; which has long been nearly finished, and &lsquo;Les Petits
  Bourgeois,&rsquo; which has been in type at the printing office for the
  last eighteen months.&rdquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
