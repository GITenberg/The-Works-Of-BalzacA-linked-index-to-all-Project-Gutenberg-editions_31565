      CHAPTER I. EXPOSITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the discipline which Marechal Suchet had introduced into
      his army corps, he was unable to prevent a short period of trouble and
      disorder at the taking of Tarragona. According to certain fair-minded
      military men, this intoxication of victory bore a striking resemblance to
      pillage, though the marechal promptly suppressed it. Order being
      re-established, each regiment quartered in its respective lines, and the
      commandant of the city appointed, military administration began. The place
      assumed a mongrel aspect. Though all things were organized on a French
      system, the Spaniards were left free to follow &ldquo;in petto&rdquo; their national
      tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This period of pillage (it is difficult to determine how long it lasted)
      had, like all other sublunary effects, a cause, not so difficult to
      discover. In the marechal&rsquo;s army was a regiment, composed almost entirely
      of Italians and commanded by a certain Colonel Eugene, a man of remarkable
      bravery, a second Murat, who, having entered the military service too
      late, obtained neither a Grand Duchy of Berg nor a Kingdom of Naples, nor
      balls at the Pizzo. But if he won no crown he had ample opportunity to
      obtain wounds, and it was not surprising that he met with several. His
      regiment was composed of the scattered fragments of the Italian legion.
      This legion was to Italy what the colonial battalions are to France. Its
      permanent cantonments, established on the island of Elba, served as an
      honorable place of exile for the troublesome sons of good families and for
      those great men who have just missed greatness, whom society brands with a
      hot iron and designates by the term &ldquo;mauvais sujets&rdquo;; men who are for the
      most part misunderstood; whose existence may become either noble through
      the smile of a woman lifting them out of their rut, or shocking at the
      close of an orgy under the influence of some damnable reflection dropped
      by a drunken comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon had incorporated these vigorous beings in the sixth of the line,
      hoping to metamorphose them finally into generals,&mdash;barring those
      whom the bullets might take off. But the emperor&rsquo;s calculation was
      scarcely fulfilled, except in the matter of the bullets. This regiment,
      often decimated but always the same in character, acquired a great
      reputation for valor in the field and for wickedness in private life. At
      the siege of Tarragona it lost its celebrated hero, Bianchi, the man who,
      during the campaign, had wagered that he would eat the heart of a Spanish
      sentinel, and did eat it. Though Bianchi was the prince of the devils
      incarnate to whom the regiment owed its dual reputation, he had,
      nevertheless, that sort of chivalrous honor which excuses, in the army,
      the worst excesses. In a word, he would have been, at an earlier period,
      an admirable pirate. A few days before his death he distinguished himself
      by a daring action which the marechal wished to reward. Bianchi refused
      rank, pension, and additional decoration, asking, for sole recompense, the
      favor of being the first to mount the breach at the assault on Tarragona.
      The marechal granted the request and then forgot his promise; but Bianchi
      forced him to remember Bianchi. The enraged hero was the first to plant
      our flag on the wall, where he was shot by a monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This historical digression was necessary, in order to explain how it was
      that the 6th of the line was the regiment to enter Tarragona, and why the
      disorder and confusion, natural enough in a city taken by storm,
      degenerated for a time into a slight pillage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This regiment possessed two officers, not at all remarkable among these
      men of iron, who played, nevertheless, in the history we shall now relate,
      a somewhat important part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first, a captain in the quartermaster&rsquo;s department, an officer half
      civil, half military, was considered, in soldier phrase, to be fighting
      his own battle. He pretended bravery, boasted loudly of belonging to the
      6th of the line, twirled his moustache with the air of a man who was ready
      to demolish everything; but his brother officers did not esteem him. The
      fortune he possessed made him cautious. He was nicknamed, for two reasons,
      &ldquo;captain of crows.&rdquo; In the first place, he could smell powder a league
      off, and took wing at the sound of a musket; secondly, the nickname was
      based on an innocent military pun, which his position in the regiment
      warranted. Captain Montefiore, of the illustrious Montefiore family of
      Milan (though the laws of the Kingdom of Italy forbade him to bear his
      title in the French service) was one of the handsomest men in the army.
      This beauty may have been among the secret causes of his prudence on
      fighting days. A wound which might have injured his nose, cleft his
      forehead, or scarred his cheek, would have destroyed one of the most
      beautiful Italian faces which a woman ever dreamed of in all its delicate
      proportions. This face, not unlike the type which Girodet has given to the
      dying young Turk, in the &ldquo;Revolt at Cairo,&rdquo; was instinct with that
      melancholy by which all women are more or less duped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis de Montefiore possessed an entailed property, but his income
      was mortgaged for a number of years to pay off the costs of certain
      Italian escapades which are inconceivable in Paris. He had ruined himself
      in supporting a theatre at Milan in order to force upon a public a very
      inferior prima donna, whom he was said to love madly. A fine future was
      therefore before him, and he did not care to risk it for the paltry
      distinction of a bit of red ribbon. He was not a brave man, but he was
      certainly a philosopher; and he had precedents, if we may use so
      parliamentary an expression. Did not Philip the Second register a vow
      after the battle of Saint Quentin that never again would he put himself
      under fire? And did not the Duke of Alba encourage him in thinking that
      the worst trade in the world was the involuntary exchange of a crown for a
      bullet? Hence, Montefiore was Philippiste in his capacity of rich marquis
      and handsome man; and in other respects also he was quite as profound a
      politician as Philip the Second himself. He consoled himself for his
      nickname, and for the disesteem of the regiment by thinking that his
      comrades were blackguards, whose opinion would never be of any consequence
      to him if by chance they survived the present war, which seemed to be one
      of extermination. He relied on his face to win him promotion; he saw
      himself made colonel by feminine influence and a carefully managed
      transition from captain of equipment to orderly officer, and from orderly
      officer to aide-de-camp on the staff of some easy-going marshal. By that
      time, he reflected, he should come into his property of a hundred thousand
      scudi a year, some journal would speak of him as &ldquo;the brave Montefiore,&rdquo;
       he would marry a girl of rank, and no one would dare to dispute his
      courage or verify his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Montefiore had one friend in the person of the quartermaster,
      &mdash;a Provencal, born in the neighborhood of Nice, whose name was
      Diard. A friend, whether at the galleys or in the garret of an artist,
      consoles for many troubles. Now Montefiore and Diard were two
      philosophers, who consoled each other for their present lives by the study
      of vice, as artists soothe the immediate disappointment of their hopes by
      the expectation of future fame. Both regarded the war in its results, not
      its action; they simply considered those who died for glory fools. Chance
      had made soldiers of them; whereas their natural proclivities would have
      seated them at the green table of a congress. Nature had poured Montefiore
      into the mould of a Rizzio, and Diard into that of a diplomatist. Both
      were endowed with that nervous, feverish, half-feminine organization,
      which is equally strong for good or evil, and from which may emanate,
      according to the impulse of these singular temperaments, a crime or a
      generous action, a noble deed or a base one. The fate of such natures
      depends at any moment on the pressure, more or less powerful, produced on
      their nervous systems by violent and transitory passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard was considered a good accountant, but no soldier would have trusted
      him with his purse or his will, possibly because of the antipathy felt by
      all real soldiers against the bureaucrats. The quartermaster was not
      without courage and a certain juvenile generosity, sentiments which many
      men give up as they grow older, by dint of reasoning or calculating.
      Variable as the beauty of a fair woman, Diard was a great boaster and a
      great talker, talking of everything. He said he was artistic, and he made
      prizes (like two celebrated generals) of works of art, solely, he
      declared, to preserve them for posterity. His military comrades would have
      been puzzled indeed to form a correct judgment of him. Many of them,
      accustomed to draw upon his funds when occasion obliged them, thought him
      rich; but in truth, he was a gambler, and gamblers may be said to have
      nothing of their own. Montefiore was also a gambler, and all the officers
      of the regiment played with the pair; for, to the shame of men be it said,
      it is not a rare thing to see persons gambling together around a green
      table who, when the game is finished, will not bow to their companions,
      feeling no respect for them. Montefiore was the man with whom Bianchi made
      his bet about the heart of the Spanish sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore and Diard were among the last to mount the breach at Tarragona,
      but the first in the heart of the town as soon as it was taken. Accidents
      of this sort happen in all attacks, but with this pair of friends they
      were customary. Supporting each other, they made their way bravely through
      a labyrinth of narrow and gloomy little streets in quest of their personal
      objects; one seeking for painted madonnas, the other for madonnas of flesh
      and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what part of Tarragona it happened I cannot say, but Diard presently
      recognized by its architecture the portal of a convent, the gate of which
      was already battered in. Springing into the cloister to put a stop to the
      fury of the soldiers, he arrived just in time to prevent two Parisians
      from shooting a Virgin by Albano. In spite of the moustache with which in
      their military fanaticism they had decorated her face, he bought the
      picture. Montefiore, left alone during this episode, noticed, nearly
      opposite the convent, the house and shop of a draper, from which a shot
      was fired at him at the moment when his eyes caught a flaming glance from
      those of an inquisitive young girl, whose head was advanced under the
      shelter of a blind. Tarragona taken by assault, Tarragona furious, firing
      from every window, Tarragona violated, with dishevelled hair, and
      half-naked, was indeed an object of curiosity,&mdash;the curiosity of a
      daring Spanish woman. It was a magnified bull-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore forgot the pillage, and heard, for the moment, neither the
      cries, nor the musketry, nor the growling of the artillery. The profile of
      that Spanish girl was the most divinely delicious thing which he, an
      Italian libertine, weary of Italian beauty, and dreaming of an impossible
      woman because he was tired of all women, had ever seen. He could still
      quiver, he, who had wasted his fortune on a thousand follies, the thousand
      passions of a young and blase man&mdash;the most abominable monster that
      society generates. An idea came into his head, suggested perhaps by the
      shot of the draper-patriot, namely,&mdash;to set fire to the house. But he
      was now alone, and without any means of action; the fighting was centred
      in the market-place, where a few obstinate beings were still defending the
      town. A better idea then occurred to him. Diard came out of the convent,
      but Montefiore said not a word of his discovery; on the contrary, he
      accompanied him on a series of rambles about the streets. But the next
      day, the Italian had obtained his military billet in the house of the
      draper,&mdash;an appropriate lodging for an equipment captain!
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of the worthy Spaniard consisted, on the ground-floor, of a vast
      and gloomy shop, externally fortified with stout iron bars, such as we see
      in the old storehouses of the rue des Lombards. This shop communicated
      with a parlor lighted from an interior courtyard, a large room breathing
      the very spirit of the middle-ages, with smoky old pictures, old
      tapestries, antique &ldquo;brazero,&rdquo; a plumed hat hanging to a nail, the musket
      of the guerrillas, and the cloak of Bartholo. The kitchen adjoined this
      unique living-room, where the inmates took their meals and warmed
      themselves over the dull glow of the brazier, smoking cigars and
      discoursing bitterly to animate all hearts with hatred against the French.
      Silver pitchers and precious dishes of plate and porcelain adorned a
      buttery shelf of the old fashion. But the light, sparsely admitted,
      allowed these dazzling objects to show but slightly; all things, as in
      pictures of the Dutch school, looked brown, even the faces. Between the
      shop and this living-room, so fine in color and in its tone of patriarchal
      life, was a dark staircase leading to a ware-room where the light,
      carefully distributed, permitted the examination of goods. Above this were
      the apartments of the merchant and his wife. Rooms for an apprentice and a
      servant-woman were in a garret under the roof, which projected over the
      street and was supported by buttresses, giving a somewhat fantastic
      appearance to the exterior of the building. These chambers were now taken
      by the merchant and his wife who gave up their own rooms to the officer
      who was billeted upon them,&mdash;probably because they wished to avoid
      all quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore gave himself out as a former Spanish subject, persecuted by
      Napoleon, whom he was serving against his will; and these semi-lies had
      the success he expected. He was invited to share the meals of the family,
      and was treated with the respect due to his name, his birth, and his
      title. He had his reasons for capturing the good-will of the merchant and
      his wife; he scented his madonna as the ogre scented the youthful flesh of
      Tom Thumb and his brothers. But in spite of the confidence he managed to
      inspire in the worthy pair the latter maintained the most profound silence
      as to the said madonna; and not only did the captain see no trace of the
      young girl during the first day he spent under the roof of the honest
      Spaniard, but he heard no sound and came upon no indication which revealed
      her presence in that ancient building. Supposing that she was the only
      daughter of the old couple, Montefiore concluded they had consigned her to
      the garret, where, for the time being, they made their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no revelation came to betray the hiding-place of that precious
      treasure. The marquis glued his face to the lozenge-shaped leaded panes
      which looked upon the black-walled enclosure of the inner courtyard; but
      in vain; he saw no gleam of light except from the windows of the old
      couple, whom he could see and hear as they went and came and talked and
      coughed. Of the young girl, not a shadow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore was far too wary to risk the future of his passion by exploring
      the house nocturnally, or by tapping softly on the doors. Discovery by
      that hot patriot, the mercer, suspicious as a Spaniard must be, meant ruin
      infallibly. The captain therefore resolved to wait patiently, resting his
      faith on time and the imperfection of men, which always results&mdash;even
      with scoundrels, and how much more with honest men!&mdash;in the neglect
      of precautions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he discovered a hammock in the kitchen, showing plainly where
      the servant-woman slept. As for the apprentice, his bed was evidently made
      on the shop counter. During supper on the second day Montefiore succeeded,
      by cursing Napoleon, in smoothing the anxious forehead of the merchant, a
      grave, black-visaged Spaniard, much like the faces formerly carved on the
      handles of Moorish lutes; even the wife let a gay smile of hatred appear
      in the folds of her elderly face. The lamp and the reflections of the
      brazier illumined fantastically the shadows of the noble room. The
      mistress of the house offered a &ldquo;cigarrito&rdquo; to their semi-compatriot. At
      this moment the rustle of a dress and the fall of a chair behind the
      tapestry were plainly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the wife, turning pale, &ldquo;may the saints assist us! God grant
      no harm has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some one in the next room, have you not?&rdquo; said Montefiore,
      giving no sign of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The draper dropped a word of imprecation against the girls. Evidently
      alarmed, the wife opened a secret door, and led in, half fainting, the
      Italian&rsquo;s madonna, to whom he was careful to pay no attention; only, to
      avoid a too-studied indifference, he glanced at the girl before he turned
      to his host and said in his own language:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your daughter, signore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez de Lagounia (such was the merchant&rsquo;s name) had large commercial
      relations with Genoa, Florence, and Livorno; he knew Italian, and replied
      in the same language:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; if she were my daughter I should take less precautions. The child is
      confided to our care, and I would rather die than see any evil happen to
      her. But how is it possible to put sense into a girl of eighteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very handsome,&rdquo; said Montefiore, coldly, not looking at her face
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother&rsquo;s beauty is celebrated,&rdquo; replied the merchant, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued to smoke, watching each other. Though Montefiore compelled
      himself not to give the slightest look which might contradict his apparent
      coldness, he could not refrain, at a moment when Perez turned his head to
      expectorate, from casting a rapid glance at the young girl, whose
      sparkling eyes met his. Then, with that science of vision which gives to a
      libertine, as it does to a sculptor, the fatal power of disrobing, if we
      may so express it, a woman, and divining her shape by inductions both
      rapid and sagacious, he beheld one of those masterpieces of Nature whose
      creation appears to demand as its right all the happiness of love. Here
      was a fair young face, on which the sun of Spain had cast faint tones of
      bistre which added to its expression of seraphic calmness a passionate
      pride, like a flash of light infused beneath that diaphanous complexion,&mdash;due,
      perhaps, to the Moorish blood which vivified and colored it. Her hair,
      raised to the top of her head, fell thence with black reflections round
      the delicate transparent ears and defined the outlines of a blue-veined
      throat. These luxuriant locks brought into strong relief the dazzling eyes
      and the scarlet lips of a well-arched mouth. The bodice of the country set
      off the lines of a figure that swayed as easily as a branch of willow. She
      was not the Virgin of Italy, but the Virgin of Spain, of Murillo, the only
      artist daring enough to have painted the Mother of God intoxicated with
      the joy of conceiving the Christ,&mdash;the glowing imagination of the
      boldest and also the warmest of painters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this young girl three things were united, a single one of which would
      have sufficed for the glory of a woman: the purity of the pearl in the
      depths of ocean; the sublime exaltation of the Spanish Saint Teresa; and a
      passion of love which was ignorant of itself. The presence of such a woman
      has the virtue of a talisman. Montefiore no longer felt worn and jaded.
      That young girl brought back his youthful freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though the apparition was delightful, it did not last. The girl was
      taken back to the secret chamber, where the servant-woman carried to her
      openly both light and food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do right to hide her,&rdquo; said Montefiore in Italian. &ldquo;I will keep your
      secret. The devil! we have generals in our army who are capable of
      abducting her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore&rsquo;s infatuation went so far as to suggest to him the idea of
      marrying her. He accordingly asked her history, and Perez very willingly
      told him the circumstances under which she had become his ward. The
      prudent Spaniard was led to make this confidence because he had heard of
      Montefiore in Italy, and knowing his reputation was desirous to let him
      see how strong were the barriers which protected the young girl from the
      possibility of seduction. Though the good-man was gifted with a certain
      patriarchal eloquence, in keeping with his simple life and customs, his
      tale will be improved by abridgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period when the French Revolution changed the manners and morals of
      every country which served as the scene of its wars, a street prostitute
      came to Tarragona, driven from Venice at the time of its fall. The life of
      this woman had been a tissue of romantic adventures and strange
      vicissitudes. To her, oftener than to any other woman of her class, it had
      happened, thanks to the caprice of great lords struck with her
      extraordinary beauty, to be literally gorged with gold and jewels and all
      the delights of excessive wealth,&mdash;flowers, carriages, pages, maids,
      palaces, pictures, journeys (like those of Catherine II.); in short, the
      life of a queen, despotic in her caprices and obeyed, often beyond her own
      imaginings. Then, without herself, or any one, chemist, physician, or man
      of science, being able to discover how her gold evaporated, she would find
      herself back in the streets, poor, denuded of everything, preserving
      nothing but her all-powerful beauty, yet living on without thought or care
      of the past, the present, or the future. Cast, in her poverty, into the
      hands of some poor gambling officer, she attached herself to him as a dog
      to its master, sharing the discomforts of the military life, which indeed
      she comforted, as content under the roof of a garret as beneath the silken
      hangings of opulence. Italian and Spanish both, she fulfilled very
      scrupulously the duties of religion, and more than once she had said to
      love:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to-morrow; to-day I belong to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this slime permeated with gold and perfumes, this careless
      indifference to all things, these unbridled passions, these religious
      beliefs cast into that heart like diamonds into mire, this life begun, and
      ended, in a hospital, these gambling chances transferred to the soul, to
      the very existence,&mdash;in short, this great alchemy, for which vice lit
      the fire beneath the crucible in which fortunes were melted up and the
      gold of ancestors and the honor of great names evaporated, proceeded from
      a <i>cause</i>, a particular heredity, faithfully transmitted from mother
      to daughter since the middle ages. The name of this woman was La Marana.
      In her family, existing solely in the female line, the idea, person, name
      and power of a father had been completely unknown since the thirteenth
      century. The name Marana was to her what the designation of Stuart is to
      the celebrated royal race of Scotland, a name of distinction substituted
      for the patronymic name by the constant heredity of the same office
      devolving on the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly, in France, Spain, and Italy, when those three countries had, in
      the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, mutual interests which united and
      disunited them by perpetual warfare, the name Marana served to express in
      its general sense, a prostitute. In those days women of that sort had a
      certain rank in the world of which nothing in our day can give an idea.
      Ninon de l&rsquo;Enclos and Marian Delorme have alone played, in France, the
      role of the Imperias, Catalinas, and Maranas who, in preceding centuries,
      gathered around them the cassock, gown, and sword. An Imperia built I
      forget which church in Rome in a frenzy of repentance, as Rhodope built,
      in earlier times, a pyramid in Egypt. The name Marana, inflicted at first
      as a disgrace upon the singular family with which we are now concerned,
      had ended by becoming its veritable name and by ennobling its vice by
      incontestable antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a day of opulence or of penury I know not which, for this event
      was a secret between herself and God, but assuredly it was in a moment of
      repentance and melancholy, this Marana of the nineteenth century stood
      with her feet in the slime and her head raised to heaven. She cursed the
      blood in her veins, she cursed herself, she trembled lest she should have
      a daughter, and she swore, as such women swear, on the honor and with the
      will of the galleys&mdash;the firmest will, the most scrupulous honor that
      there is on earth&mdash;she swore, before an altar, and believing in that
      altar, to make her daughter a virtuous creature, a saint, and thus to
      gain, after that long line of lost women, criminals in love, an angel in
      heaven for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vow once made, the blood of the Maranas spoke; the courtesan returned
      to her reckless life, a thought the more within her heart. At last she
      loved, with the violent love of such women, as Henrietta Wilson loved Lord
      Ponsonby, as Mademoiselle Dupuis loved Bolingbroke, as the Marchesa
      Pescara loved her husband&mdash;but no, she did not love, she adored one
      of those fair men, half women, to whom she gave the virtues which she had
      not, striving to keep for herself all that there was of vice between them.
      It was from that weak man, that senseless marriage unblessed by God or man
      which happiness is thought to justify, but which no happiness absolves,
      and for which men blush at last, that she had a daughter, a daughter to
      save, a daughter for whom to desire a noble life and the chastity she had
      not. Henceforth, happy or not happy, opulent or beggared, she had in her
      heart a pure, untainted sentiment, the highest of all human feelings
      because the most disinterested. Love has its egotism, but motherhood has
      none. La Marana was a mother like none other; for, in her total, her
      eternal shipwreck, motherhood might still redeem her. To accomplish
      sacredly through life the task of sending a pure soul to heaven, was not
      that a better thing than a tardy repentance? was it not, in truth, the
      only spotless prayer which she could lift to God?
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when this daughter, when her Marie-Juana-Pepita (she would fain have
      given her all the saints in the calendar as guardians), when this dear
      little creature was granted to her, she became possessed of so high an
      idea of the dignity of motherhood that she entreated vice to grant her a
      respite. She made herself virtuous and lived in solitude. No more fetes,
      no more orgies, no more love. All joys, all fortunes were centred now in
      the cradle of her child. The tones of that infant voice made an oasis for
      her soul in the burning sands of her existence. That sentiment could not
      be measured or estimated by any other. Did it not, in fact, comprise all
      human sentiments, all heavenly hopes? La Marana was so resolved not to
      soil her daughter with any stain other than that of birth, that she sought
      to invest her with social virtues; she even obliged the young father to
      settle a handsome patrimony upon the child and to give her his name. Thus
      the girl was not know as Juana Marana, but as Juana di Mancini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after seven years of joy, and kisses, and intoxicating happiness,
      the time came when the poor Marana deprived herself of her idol. That
      Juana might never bow her head under their hereditary shame, the mother
      had the courage to renounce her child for her child&rsquo;s sake, and to seek,
      not without horrible suffering, for another mother, another home, other
      principles to follow, other and saintlier examples to imitate. The
      abdication of a mother is either a revolting act or a sublime one; in this
      case, was it not sublime?
    </p>
    <p>
      At Tarragona a lucky accident threw the Lagounias in her way, under
      circumstances which enabled her to recognize the integrity of the Spaniard
      and the noble virtue of his wife. She came to them at a time when her
      proposal seemed that of a liberating angel. The fortune and honor of the
      merchant, momentarily compromised, required a prompt and secret succor. La
      Marana made over to the husband the whole sum she had obtained of the
      father for Juana&rsquo;s &ldquo;dot,&rdquo; requiring neither acknowledgment nor interest.
      According to her own code of honor, a contract, a trust, was a thing of
      the heart, and God its supreme judge. After stating the miseries of her
      position to Dona Lagounia, she confided her daughter and her daughter&rsquo;s
      fortune to the fine old Spanish honor, pure and spotless, which filled the
      precincts of that ancient house. Dona Lagounia had no child, and she was
      only too happy to obtain one to nurture. The mother then parted from her
      Juana, convinced that the child&rsquo;s future was safe, and certain of having
      found her a mother, a mother who would bring her up as a Mancini, and not
      as a Marana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her child in the simple modest house of the merchant where the
      burgher virtues reigned, where religion and sacred sentiments and honor
      filled the air, the poor prostitute, the disinherited mother was enabled
      to bear her trial by visions of Juana, virgin, wife, and mother, a mother
      throughout her life. On the threshold of that house Marana left a tear
      such as the angels garner up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that day of mourning and hope the mother, drawn by some invincible
      presentiment, had thrice returned to see her daughter. Once when Juana
      fell ill with a dangerous complaint:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she said to Perez when she reached the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asleep, she had seen her Juana dying. She nursed her and watched her,
      until one morning, sure of the girl&rsquo;s convalescence, she kissed her, still
      asleep, on the forehead and left her without betraying whom she was. A
      second time the Marana came to the church where Juana made her first
      communion. Simply dressed, concealing herself behind a column, the exiled
      mother recognized herself in her daughter such as she once had been, pure
      as the snow fresh-fallen on the Alps. A courtesan even in maternity, the
      Marana felt in the depths of her soul a jealous sentiment, stronger for
      the moment than that of love, and she left the church, incapable of
      resisting any longer the desire to kill Dona Lagounia, as she sat there,
      with radiant face, too much the mother of her child. A third and last
      meeting had taken place between mother and daughter in the streets of
      Milan, to which city the merchant and his wife had paid a visit. The
      Marana drove through the Corso in all the splendor of a sovereign; she
      passed her daughter like a flash of lightning and was not recognized.
      Horrible anguish! To this Marana, surfeited with kisses, one was lacking,
      a single one, for which she would have bartered all the others: the
      joyous, girlish kiss of a daughter to a mother, an honored mother, a
      mother in whom shone all the domestic virtues. Juana living was dead to
      her. One thought revived the soul of the courtesan&mdash;a precious
      thought! Juana was henceforth safe. She might be the humblest of women,
      but at least she was not what her mother was&mdash;an infamous courtesan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant and his wife had fulfilled their trust with scrupulous
      integrity. Juana&rsquo;s fortune, managed by them, had increased tenfold. Perez
      de Lagounia, now the richest merchant in the provinces, felt for the young
      girl a sentiment that was semi-superstitious. Her money had preserved his
      ancient house from dishonorable ruin, and the presence of so precious a
      treasure had brought him untold prosperity. His wife, a heart of gold, and
      full of delicacy, had made the child religious, and as pure as she was
      beautiful. Juana might well become the wife of either a great seigneur or
      a wealthy merchant; she lacked no virtue necessary to the highest destiny.
      Perez had intended taking her to Madrid and marrying her to some grandee,
      but the events of the present war delayed the fulfilment of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the Marana now is,&rdquo; said Perez, ending the above
      history, &ldquo;but in whatever quarter of the world she may be living, when she
      hears of the occupation of our province by your armies, and of the siege
      of Tarragona, she will assuredly set out at once to come here and see to
      her daughter&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. AUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The foregoing narrative changed the intentions of the Italian captain; no
      longer did he think of making a Marchesa di Montefiore of Juana di
      Mancini. He recognized the blood of the Maranas in the glance the girl had
      given from behind the blinds, in the trick she had just played to satisfy
      her curiosity, and also in the parting look she had cast upon him. The
      libertine wanted a virtuous woman for a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventure was full of danger, but danger of a kind that never daunts
      the least courageous man, for love and pleasure followed it. The
      apprentice sleeping in the shop, the cook bivouacking in the kitchen,
      Perez and his wife sleeping, no doubt, the wakeful sleep of the aged, the
      echoing sonority of the old mansion, the close surveillance of the girl in
      the day-time,&mdash;all these things were obstacles, and made success a
      thing well-nigh impossible. But Montefiore had in his favor against all
      impossibilities the blood of the Maranas which gushed in the heart of that
      inquisitive girl, Italian by birth, Spanish in principles, virgin indeed,
      but impatient to love. Passion, the girl, and Montefiore were ready and
      able to defy the whole universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore, impelled as much by the instinct of a man of gallantry as by
      those vague hopes which cannot be explained, and to which we give the name
      of presentiments (a word of astonishing verbal accuracy), Montefiore spent
      the first hours of the night at his window, endeavoring to look below him
      to the secret apartment where, undoubtedly, the merchant and his wife had
      hidden the love and joyfulness of their old age. The ware-room of the
      &ldquo;entresol&rdquo; separated him from the rooms on the ground-floor. The captain
      therefore could not have recourse to noises significantly made from one
      floor to the other, an artificial language which all lovers know well how
      to create. But chance, or it may have been the young girl herself, came to
      his assistance. At the moment when he stationed himself at his window, he
      saw, on the black wall of the courtyard, a circle of light, in the centre
      of which the silhouette of Juana was clearly defined; the consecutive
      movement of the arms, and the attitude, gave evidence that she was
      arranging her hair for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she alone?&rdquo; Montefiore asked himself; &ldquo;could I, without danger, lower
      a letter filled with coin and strike it against that circular window in
      her hiding-place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once he wrote a note, the note of a man exiled by his family to Elba,
      the note of a degraded marquis now a mere captain of equipment. Then he
      made a cord of whatever he could find that was capable of being turned
      into string, filled the note with a few silver crowns, and lowered it in
      the deepest silence to the centre of that spherical gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shadows will show if her mother or the servant is with her,&rdquo; thought
      Montefiore. &ldquo;If she is not alone, I can pull up the string at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, after succeeding with infinite trouble in striking the glass, a
      single form, the little figure of Juana, appeared upon the wall. The young
      girl opened her window cautiously, saw the note, took it, and stood before
      the window while she read it. In it, Montefiore had given his name and
      asked for an interview, offering, after the style of the old romances, his
      heart and hand to the Signorina Juana di Mancini&mdash;a common trick, the
      success of which is nearly always certain. At Juana&rsquo;s age, nobility of
      soul increases the dangers which surround youth. A poet of our day has
      said: &ldquo;Woman succumbs only to her own nobility. The lover pretends to
      doubt the love he inspires at the moment when he is most beloved; the
      young girl, confident and proud, longs to make sacrifices to prove her
      love, and knows the world and men too little to continue calm in the midst
      of her rising emotions and repel with contempt the man who accepts a life
      offered in expiation of a false reproach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ever since the constitution of societies the young girl finds herself torn
      by a struggle between the caution of prudent virtue and the evils of
      wrong-doing. Often she loses a love, delightful in prospect, and the
      first, if she resists; on the other hand, she loses a marriage if she is
      imprudent. Casting a glance over the vicissitudes of social life in Paris,
      it is impossible to doubt the necessity of religion; and yet Paris is
      situated in the forty-eighth degree of latitude, while Tarragona is in the
      forty-first. The old question of climates is still useful to narrators to
      explain the sudden denouements, the imprudences, or the resistances of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore kept his eyes fixed on the exquisite black profile projected by
      the gleam upon the wall. Neither he nor Juana could see each other; a
      troublesome cornice, vexatiously placed, deprived them of the mute
      correspondence which may be established between a pair of lovers as they
      bend to each other from their windows. Thus the mind and the attention of
      the captain were concentrated on that luminous circle where, without
      perhaps knowing it herself, the young girl would, he thought, innocently
      reveal her thoughts by a series of gestures. But no! The singular motions
      she proceeded to make gave not a particle of hope to the expectant lover.
      Juana was amusing herself by cutting up his missive. But virtue and
      innocence sometimes imitate the clever proceedings inspired by jealousy to
      the Bartholos of comedy. Juana, without pens, ink, or paper, was replying
      by snip of scissors. Presently she refastened the note to the string; the
      officer drew it up, opened it, and read by the light of his lamp one word,
      carefully cut out of the paper: COME.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;but what of poison? or the dagger or carbine
      of Perez? And that apprentice not yet asleep, perhaps, in the shop? and
      the servant in her hammock? Besides, this old house echoes the slightest
      sound; I can hear old Perez snoring even here. Come, indeed! She can have
      nothing more to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bitter reflection! rakes alone are logical and will punish a woman for
      devotion. Man created Satan and Lovelace; but a virgin is an angel on whom
      he can bestow naught but his own vices. She is so grand, so beautiful,
      that he cannot magnify or embellish her; he has only the fatal power to
      blast her and drag her down into his own mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore waited for a later and more somnolent hour of the night; then,
      in spite of his reflections, he descended the stairs without boots, armed
      with his pistols, moving step by step, stopping to question the silence,
      putting forth his hands, measuring the stairs, peering into the darkness,
      and ready at the slightest incident to fly back into his room. The Italian
      had put on his handsomest uniform; he had perfumed his black hair, and now
      shone with the particular brilliancy which dress and toilet bestow upon
      natural beauty. Under such circumstances most men are as feminine as a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis arrived without hindrance before the secret door of the room
      in which the girl was hidden, a sort of cell made in the angle of the
      house and belonging exclusively to Juana, who had remained there hidden
      during the day from every eye while the siege lasted. Up to the present
      time she had slept in the room of her adopted mother, but the limited
      space in the garret where the merchant and his wife had gone to make room
      for the officer who was billeted upon them, did not allow of her going
      with them. Dona Lagounia had therefore left the young girl to the
      guardianship of lock and key, under the protection of religious ideas, all
      the more efficacious because they were partly superstitious, and also
      under the shield of a native pride and sensitive modesty which made the
      young Mancini in sort an exception among her sex. Juana possessed in an
      equal degree the most attaching virtues and the most passionate impulses;
      she had needed the modesty and sanctity of this monotonous life to calm
      and cool the tumultuous blood of the Maranas which bounded in her heart,
      the desires of which her adopted mother told her were an instigation of
      the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint ray of light traced along the sill of the secret door guided
      Montefiore to the place; he scratched the panel softly and Juana opened to
      him. Montefiore entered, palpitating, but he recognized in the expression
      of the girl&rsquo;s face complete ignorance of her peril, a sort of naive
      curiosity, and an innocent admiration. He stopped short, arrested for a
      moment by the sacredness of the picture which met his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw before him a tapestry on the walls with a gray ground sprinkled
      with violets, a little coffer of ebony, an antique mirror, an immense and
      very old arm chair also in ebony and covered with tapestry, a table with
      twisted legs, a pretty carpet on the floor, near the table a single chair;
      and that was all. On the table, however, were flowers and embroidery; in a
      recess at the farther end of the room was the narrow little bed where
      Juana dreamed. Above the bed were three pictures; and near the pillow a
      crucifix, with a holy water basin and a prayer, printed in letters of gold
      and framed. Flowers exhaled their perfume faintly; the candles cast a
      tender light; all was calm and pure and sacred. The dreamy thoughts of
      Juana, but above all Juana herself, had communicated to all things her own
      peculiar charm; her soul appeared to shine there, like the pearl in its
      matrix. Juana, dressed in white, beautiful with naught but her own beauty,
      laying down her rosary to answer love, might have inspired respect, even
      in a Montefiore, if the silence, if the night, if Juana herself had not
      seemed so amorous. Montefiore stood still, intoxicated with an unknown
      happiness, possibly that of Satan beholding heaven through a rift of the
      clouds which form its enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I saw you,&rdquo; he said in pure Tuscan, and in the modest tone of
      voice so peculiarly Italian, &ldquo;I loved you. My soul and my life are now in
      you, and in you they will be forever, if you will have it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana listened, inhaling from the atmosphere the sound of these words
      which the accents of love made magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child! how have you breathed so long the air of this dismal house
      without dying of it? You, made to reign in the world, to inhabit the
      palace of a prince, to live in the midst of fetes, to feel the joys which
      love bestows, to see the world at your feet, to efface all other beauty by
      your own which can have no rival&mdash;you, to live here, solitary, with
      those two shopkeepers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adroit question! He wished to know if Juana had a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But who can have told you my secret thoughts? For
      the last few months I have nearly died of sadness. Yes, I would <i>rather</i>
      die than stay longer in this house. Look at that embroidery; there is not
      a stitch there which I did not set with dreadful thoughts. How many times
      I have thought of escaping to fling myself into the sea! Why? I don&rsquo;t know
      why,&mdash;little childish troubles, but very keen, though they are so
      silly. Often I have kissed my mother at night as one would kiss a mother
      for the last time, saying in my heart: &lsquo;To-morrow I will kill myself.&rsquo; But
      I do not die. Suicides go to hell, you know, and I am so afraid of hell
      that I resign myself to live, to get up in the morning and go to bed at
      night, and work the same hours, and do the same things. I am not so weary
      of it, but I suffer&mdash;And yet, my father and mother adore me. Oh! I am
      bad, I am bad; I say so to my confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always live here alone, without amusement, without pleasures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have not always been like this. Till I was fifteen the festivals of
      the church, the chants, the music gave me pleasure. I was happy, feeling
      myself like the angels without sin and able to communicate every week&mdash;I
      loved God then. But for the last three years, from day to day, all things
      have changed. First, I wanted flowers here&mdash;and I have them, lovely
      flowers! Then I wanted&mdash;but I want nothing now,&rdquo; she added, after a
      pause, smiling at Montefiore. &ldquo;Have you not said that you would love me
      always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Juana,&rdquo; cried Montefiore, softly, taking her round the waist and
      pressing her to his heart, &ldquo;yes. But let me speak to you as you speak to
      God. Are you not as beautiful as Mary in heaven? Listen. I swear to you,&rdquo;
       he continued, kissing her hair, &ldquo;I swear to take that forehead for my
      altar, to make you my idol, to lay at your feet all the luxuries of the
      world. For you, my palace at Milan; for you my horses, my jewels, the
      diamonds of my ancient family; for you, each day, fresh jewels, a thousand
      pleasures, and all the joys of earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said reflectively, &ldquo;I would like that; but I feel within my
      soul that I would like better than all the world my husband. Mio caro
      sposo!&rdquo; she said, as if it were impossible to give in any other language
      the infinite tenderness, the loving elegance with which the Italian tongue
      and accent clothe those delightful words. Besides, Italian was Juana&rsquo;s
      maternal language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should find,&rdquo; she continued, with a glance at Montefiore in which shone
      the purity of the cherubim, &ldquo;I should find in <i>him</i> my dear religion,
      him and God&mdash;God and him. Is he to be you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, surely it
      will be you,&rdquo; she cried, after a pause. &ldquo;Come, and see the picture my
      father brought me from Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a candle, made a sign to Montefiore, and showed him at the foot
      of her bed a Saint Michael overthrowing the demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has he not your eyes? When I saw you from my window in
      the street, our meeting seemed to me a sign from heaven. Every day during
      my morning meditation, while waiting for my mother to call me to prayer, I
      have so gazed at that picture, that angel, that I have ended by thinking
      him my husband&mdash;oh! heavens, I speak to you as though you were
      myself. I must seem crazy to you; but if you only knew how a poor captive
      wants to tell the thoughts that choke her! When alone, I talk to my
      flowers, to my tapestry; they can understand me better, I think, than my
      father and mother, who are so grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana,&rdquo; said Montefiore, taking her hands and kissing them with the
      passion that gushed in his eyes, in his gestures, in the tones of his
      voice, &ldquo;speak to me as your husband, as yourself. I have suffered all that
      you have suffered. Between us two few words are needed to make us
      comprehend our past, but there will never be enough to express our coming
      happiness. Lay your hand upon my heart. Feel how it beats. Let us promise
      before God, who sees and hears us, to be faithful to each other throughout
      our lives. Here, take my ring&mdash;and give me yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you my ring!&rdquo; she said in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Montefiore, uneasy at such artlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But our holy father the Pope has blessed it; it was put upon my finger in
      childhood by a beautiful lady who took care of me, and who told me never
      to part with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana, you cannot love me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here it is; take it. You, are you not another myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out the ring with a trembling hand, holding it tightly as she
      looked at Montefiore with a clear and penetrating eye that questioned him.
      That ring! all of herself was in it; but she gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Juana!&rdquo; said Montefiore, again pressing her in his arms. &ldquo;I should
      be a monster indeed if I deceived you. I will love you forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana was thoughtful. Montefiore, reflecting that in this first interview
      he ought to venture upon nothing that might frighten a young girl so
      ignorantly pure, so imprudent by virtue rather than from desire, postponed
      all further action to the future, relying on his beauty, of which he knew
      the power, and on this innocent ring-marriage, the hymen of the heart, the
      lightest, yet the strongest of all ceremonies. For the rest of that night,
      and throughout the next day, Juana&rsquo;s imagination was the accomplice of her
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this first evening Montefiore forced himself to be as respectful as he
      was tender. With that intention, in the interests of his passion and the
      desires with which Juana inspired him, he was caressing and unctuous in
      language; he launched the young creature into plans for a new existence,
      described to her the world under glowing colors, talked to her of
      household details always attractive to the mind of girls, giving her a
      sense of the rights and realities of love. Then, having agreed upon the
      hour for their future nocturnal interviews, he left her happy, but
      changed; the pure and pious Juana existed no longer; in the last glance
      she gave him, in the pretty movement by which she brought her forehead to
      his lips, there was already more of passion than a girl should feel.
      Solitude, weariness of employments contrary to her nature had brought this
      about. To make the daughter of the Maranas truly virtuous, she ought to
      have been habituated, little by little, to the world, or else to have been
      wholly withdrawn from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day, to-morrow, will seem very long to me,&rdquo; she said, receiving his
      kisses on her forehead. &ldquo;But stay in the salon, and speak loud, that I may
      hear your voice; it fills my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore, clever enough to imagine the girl&rsquo;s life, was all the more
      satisfied with himself for restraining his desires because he saw that it
      would lead to his greater contentment. He returned to his room without
      accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days went by without any event occurring to trouble the peace and
      solitude of the house. Montefiore employed his Italian cajolery on old
      Perez, on Dona Lagounia, on the apprentice, even on the cook, and they all
      liked him; but, in spite of the confidence he now inspired in them, he
      never asked to see Juana, or to have the door of her mysterious
      hiding-place opened to him. The young girl, hungry to see her lover,
      implored him to do so; but he always refused her from an instinct of
      prudence. Besides, he had used his best powers and fascinations to lull
      the suspicions of the old couple, and had now accustomed them to see him,
      a soldier, stay in bed till midday on pretence that he was ill. Thus the
      lovers lived only in the night-time, when the rest of the household were
      asleep. If Montefiore had not been one of those libertines whom the habit
      of gallantry enables to retain their self-possession under all
      circumstances, he might have been lost a dozen times during those ten
      days. A young lover, in the simplicity of a first love, would have
      committed the enchanting imprudences which are so difficult to resist. But
      he did resist even Juana herself, Juana pouting, Juana making her long
      hair a chain which she wound about his neck when caution told him he must
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most suspicious of guardians would however have been puzzled to detect
      the secret of their nightly meetings. It is to be supposed that, sure of
      success, the Italian marquis gave himself the ineffable pleasures of a
      slow seduction, step by step, leading gradually to the fire which should
      end the affair in a conflagration. On the eleventh day, at the
      dinner-table, he thought it wise to inform old Perez, under seal of
      secrecy, that the reason of his separation from his family was an
      ill-assorted marriage. This false revelation was an infamous thing in view
      of the nocturnal drama which was being played under that roof. Montefiore,
      an experienced rake, was preparing for the finale of that drama which he
      foresaw and enjoyed as an artist who loves his art. He expected to leave
      before long, and without regret, the house and his love. It would happen,
      he thought, in this way: Juana, after waiting for him in vain for several
      nights, would risk her life, perhaps, in asking Perez what had become of
      his guest; and Perez would reply, not aware of the importance of his
      answer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis de Montefiore is reconciled to his family, who consent to
      receive his wife; he has gone to Italy to present her to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Juana?&mdash;The marquis never asked himself what would become of
      Juana; but he had studied her character, its nobility, candor, and
      strength, and he knew he might be sure of her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obtained a mission from one of the generals. Three days later, on the
      night preceding his intended departure, Montefiore, instead of returning
      to his own room after dinner, contrived to enter unseen that of Juana, to
      make that farewell night the longer. Juana, true Spaniard and true
      Italian, was enchanted with such boldness; it argued ardor! For herself
      she did not fear discovery. To find in the pure love of marriage the
      excitements of intrigue, to hide her husband behind the curtains of her
      bed, and say to her adopted father and mother, in case of detection: &ldquo;I am
      the Marquise de Montefiore!&rdquo;&mdash;was to an ignorant and romantic young
      girl, who for three years past had dreamed of love without dreaming of its
      dangers, delightful. The door closed on this last evening upon her folly,
      her happiness, like a veil, which it is useless here to raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock; the merchant and his wife were reading their evening
      prayers; suddenly the noise of a carriage drawn by several horses
      resounded in the street; loud and hasty raps echoed from the shop where
      the servant hurried to open the door, and into that venerable salon rushed
      a woman, magnificently dressed in spite of the mud upon the wheels of her
      travelling-carriage, which had just crossed Italy, France, and Spain. It
      was, of course, the Marana,&mdash;the Marana who, in spite of her
      thirty-six years, was still in all the glory of her ravishing beauty; the
      Marana who, being at that time the mistress of a king, had left Naples,
      the fetes, the skies of Naples, the climax of her life of luxury, on
      hearing from her royal lover of the events in Spain and the siege of
      Tarragona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarragona! I must get to Tarragona before the town is taken!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;Ten days to reach Tarragona!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then without caring for crown or court, she arrived in Tarragona,
      furnished with an almost imperial safe-conduct; furnished too with gold
      which enabled her to cross France with the velocity of a rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter! my daughter!&rdquo; cried the Marana.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this voice, and the abrupt invasion of their solitude, the prayer-book
      fell from the hands of the old couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is there,&rdquo; replied the merchant, calmly, after a pause during which
      he recovered from the emotion caused by the abrupt entrance, and the look
      and voice of the mother. &ldquo;She is there,&rdquo; he repeated, pointing to the door
      of the little chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but has any harm come to her; is she still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly well,&rdquo; said Dona Lagounia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! send me to hell if it so pleases thee!&rdquo; cried the Marana,
      dropping, exhausted and half dead, into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flush in her cheeks, due to anxiety, paled suddenly; she had strength
      to endure suffering, but none to bear this joy. Joy was more violent in
      her soul than suffering, for it contained the echoes of her pain and the
      agonies of its own emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how have you kept her safe? Tarragona is taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Perez, &ldquo;but since you see me living why do you ask that
      question? Should I not have died before harm could have come to Juana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that answer, the Marana seized the calloused hand of the old man, and
      kissed it, wetting it with the tears that flowed from her eyes&mdash;she
      who never wept! those tears were all she had most precious under heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Perez!&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;But have you had no soldiers quartered
      in your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; replied the Spaniard. &ldquo;Fortunately for us the most loyal of
      men; a Spaniard by birth, but now an Italian who hates Bonaparte; a
      married man. He is ill, and gets up late and goes to bed early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Italian! What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montefiore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be the Marquis de Montefiore&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Senora, he himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he seen Juana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dona Lagounia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, wife,&rdquo; said Perez. &ldquo;The marquis must have seen her for
      a moment, a short moment, it is true; but I think he looked at her that
      evening she came in here during supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, let me see my daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; said Perez; &ldquo;she is now asleep. If she has left the key
      in the lock we must waken her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he rose to take the duplicate key of Juana&rsquo;s door his eyes fell by
      chance on the circular gleam of light upon the black wall of the inner
      courtyard. Within that circle he saw the shadow of a group such as Canova
      alone has attempted to render. The Spaniard turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he said to the Marana, &ldquo;where to find the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very pale,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will show you why,&rdquo; he cried, seizing his dagger and rapping its
      hilt violently on Juana&rsquo;s door as he shouted,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open! open! open! Juana!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana did not open, for she needed time to conceal Montefiore. She knew
      nothing of what was passing in the salon; the double portieres of thick
      tapestry deadened all sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I lied to you in saying I could not find the key. Here it is,&rdquo;
       added Perez, taking it from a sideboard. &ldquo;But it is useless. Juana&rsquo;s key
      is in the lock; her door is barricaded. We have been deceived, my wife!&rdquo;
       he added, turning to Dona Lagounia. &ldquo;There is a man in Juana&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! By my eternal salvation I say it is impossible!&rdquo; said his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not swear, Dona Lagounia. Our honor is dead, and this woman&mdash;&rdquo; He
      pointed to the Marana, who had risen and was standing motionless, blasted
      by his words, &ldquo;this woman has the right to despise us. She saved our life,
      our fortune, and our honor, and we have saved nothing for her but her
      money&mdash;Juana!&rdquo; he cried again, &ldquo;open, or I will burst in your door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice, rising in violence, echoed through the garrets in the roof. He
      was cold and calm. The life of Montefiore was in his hands; he would wash
      away his remorse in the blood of that Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out, out, out! out, all of you!&rdquo; cried the Marana, springing like a
      tigress on the dagger, which she wrenched from the hand of the astonished
      Perez. &ldquo;Out, Perez,&rdquo; she continued more calmly, &ldquo;out, you and your wife
      and servants! There will be murder here. You might be shot by the French.
      Have nothing to do with this; it is my affair, mine only. Between my
      daughter and me there is none but God. As for the man, he belongs to <i>me</i>.
      The whole earth could not tear him from my grasp. Go, go! I forgive you. I
      see plainly that the girl is a Marana. You, your religion, your virtue,
      were too weak to fight against my blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a dreadful sigh, turning her dry eyes on them. She had lost all,
      but she knew how to suffer,&mdash;a true courtesan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. The Marana forgot all else, and Perez, making a sign to
      his wife, remained at his post. With his old invincible Spanish honor he
      was determined to share the vengeance of the betrayed mother. Juana, all
      in white, and softly lighted by the wax candles, was standing calmly in
      the centre of her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marana could not repress a passing shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;has this room another issue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez made a negative gesture; confiding in that gesture, the mother
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am your mother, your judge; you have placed yourself
      in the only situation in which I could reveal myself to you. You have come
      down to me, you, whom I thought in heaven. Ah! you have fallen low indeed.
      You have a lover in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, there is and can be no one but my husband,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;I
      am the Marquise de Montefiore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are two,&rdquo; said Perez, in a grave voice. &ldquo;He told me he was
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montefiore, my love!&rdquo; cried the girl, tearing aside the curtain and
      revealing the officer. &ldquo;Come! they are slandering you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian appeared, pale and speechless; he saw the dagger in the
      Marana&rsquo;s hand, and he knew her well. With one bound he sprang from the
      room, crying out in a thundering voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help! they are murdering a Frenchman. Soldiers of the 6th of the
      line, rush for Captain Diard! Help, help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez had gripped the man and was trying to gag him with his large hand,
      but the Marana stopped him, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bind him fast, but let him shout. Open the doors, leave them open, and
      go, go, as I told you; go, all of you.&mdash;As for you,&rdquo; she said,
      addressing Montefiore, &ldquo;shout, call for help if you choose; by the time
      your soldiers get here this blade will be in your heart. Are you married?
      Answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montefiore, who had fallen on the threshold of the door, scarcely a step
      from Juana, saw nothing but the blade of the dagger, the gleam of which
      blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he deceived me?&rdquo; said Juana, slowly. &ldquo;He told me he was free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that he was married,&rdquo; repeated Perez, in his solemn voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; murmured Dona Lagounia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer, soul of corruption,&rdquo; said the Marana, in a low voice, bending to
      the ear of the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter&mdash;&rdquo; began Montefiore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter that was mine is dead or dying,&rdquo; interrupted the Marana. &ldquo;I
      have no daughter; do not utter that word. Answer, are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame,&rdquo; said Montefiore, at last, striving to gain time, &ldquo;I desire
      to marry your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My noble Montefiore!&rdquo; said Juana, drawing a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you attempt to fly and cry for help?&rdquo; asked Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrible, revealing light!
    </p>
    <p>
      Juana said nothing, but she wrung her hands and went to her arm-chair and
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a tumult rose in the street which was plainly heard in the
      silence of the room. A soldier of the 6th, hearing Montefiore&rsquo;s cry for
      help, had summoned Diard. The quartermaster, who was fortunately in his
      bivouac, came, accompanied by friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I fly?&rdquo; said Montefiore, hearing the voice of his friend.
      &ldquo;Because I told you the truth; I am married&mdash;Diard! Diard!&rdquo; he
      shouted in a piercing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at a word from Perez, the apprentice closed and bolted the doors, so
      that the soldiers were delayed by battering them in. Before they could
      enter, the Marana had time to strike her dagger into the guilty man; but
      anger hindered her aim, the blade slipped upon the Italian&rsquo;s epaulet,
      though she struck her blow with such force that he fell at the very feet
      of Juana, who took no notice of him. The Marana sprang upon him, and this
      time, resolved not to miss her prey, she caught him by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am free and I will marry her! I swear it, by God, by my mother, by all
      there is most sacred in the world; I am a bachelor; I will marry her, on
      my honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he bit the arm of the courtesan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Juana, &ldquo;kill him. He is so base that I will not have him
      for my husband, were he ten times as beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I recognize my daughter!&rdquo; cried the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; demanded the quartermaster, entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are murdering me,&rdquo; cried Montefiore, &ldquo;on account of this girl; she
      says I am her lover. She inveigled me into a trap, and they are forcing me
      to marry her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you reject her?&rdquo; cried Diard, struck with the splendid beauty which
      contempt, hatred, and indignation had given to the girl, already so
      beautiful. &ldquo;Then you are hard to please. If she wants a husband I am ready
      to marry her. Put up your weapons; there is no trouble here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marana pulled the Italian to the side of her daughter&rsquo;s bed and said
      to him, in a low voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I spare you, give thanks for the rest of your life; but, remember
      this, if your tongue ever injures my daughter you will see me again. Go!&mdash;How
      much &lsquo;dot&rsquo; do you give her?&rdquo; she continued, going up to Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has two hundred thousand gold piastres,&rdquo; replied the Spaniard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not all, monsieur,&rdquo; said the Marana, turning to Diard. &ldquo;Who
      are you?&mdash;Go!&rdquo; she repeated to Montefiore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis, hearing this statement of gold piastres, came forward once
      more, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really free&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance from Juana silenced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really free to go,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! monsieur,&rdquo; said the girl, turning to Diard, &ldquo;I thank you with
      admiration. But my husband is in heaven. To-morrow I shall enter a convent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana, my Juana, hush!&rdquo; cried the mother, clasping her in her arms. Then
      she whispered in the girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> have another husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana turned pale. She freed herself from her mother and sat down once
      more in her arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, monsieur?&rdquo; repeated the Marana, addressing Diard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I am at present only the quartermaster of the 6th of the line.
      But for such a wife I have the heart to make myself a marshal of France.
      My name is Pierre-Francois Diard. My father was provost of merchants. I am
      not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, at least, you are an honest man, are you not?&rdquo; cried the Marana,
      interrupting him. &ldquo;If you please the Signorina Juana di Mancini, you can
      marry her and be happy together.&mdash;Juana,&rdquo; she continued in a grave
      tone, &ldquo;in becoming the wife of a brave and worthy man remember that you
      will also be a mother. I have sworn that you shall kiss your children
      without a blush upon your face&rdquo; (her voice faltered slightly). &ldquo;I have
      sworn that you shall live a virtuous life; expect, therefore, many
      troubles. But, whatever happens, continue pure, and be faithful to your
      husband. Sacrifice all things to him, for he will be the father of your
      children&mdash;the father of your children! If you take a lover, I, your
      mother, will stand between you and him. Do you see that dagger? It is in
      your &lsquo;dot,&rsquo;&rdquo; she continued, throwing the weapon on Juana&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;I leave
      it there as the guarantee of your honor so long as my eyes are open and my
      arm free. Farewell,&rdquo; she said, restraining her tears. &ldquo;God grant that we
      may never meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that idea, her tears began to flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you have been happier than you knew in this dull
      home.&mdash;Do not allow her to regret it,&rdquo; she said, turning to Diard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing rapid narrative is not the principal subject of this Study,
      for the understanding of which it was necessary to explain how it happened
      that the quartermaster Diard married Juana di Mancini, that Montefiore and
      Diard were intimately known to each other, and to show plainly what blood
      and what passions were in Madame Diard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE HISTORY OF MADAME DIARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the time that the quartermaster had fulfilled all the long and dilatory
      formalities without which no French soldier can be married, he was
      passionately in love with Juana di Mancini, and Juana had had time to
      think of her coming destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful destiny! Juana, who felt neither esteem nor love for Diard, was
      bound to him forever, by a rash but necessary promise. The man was neither
      handsome nor well-made. His manners, devoid of all distinction, were a
      mixture of the worst army tone, the habits of his province, and his own
      insufficient education. How could she love Diard, she, a young girl all
      grace and elegance, born with an invincible instinct for luxury and good
      taste, her very nature tending toward the sphere of the higher social
      classes? As for esteeming him, she rejected the very thought precisely
      because he had married her. This repulsion was natural. Woman is a saintly
      and noble creature, but almost always misunderstood, and nearly always
      misjudged because she is misunderstood. If Juana had loved Diard she would
      have esteemed him. Love creates in a wife a new woman; the woman of the
      day before no longer exists on the morrow. Putting on the nuptial robe of
      a passion in which life itself is concerned, the woman wraps herself in
      purity and whiteness. Reborn into virtue and chastity, there is no past
      for her; she is all future, and should forget the things behind her to
      relearn life. In this sense the famous words which a modern poet has put
      into the lips of Marion Delorme is infused with truth,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Love remade me virgin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That line seems like a reminiscence of a tragedy of Corneille, so truly
      does it recall the energetic diction of the father of our modern theatre.
      Yet the poet was forced to sacrifice it to the essentially vaudevillist
      spirit of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Juana loveless was doomed to be Juana humiliated, degraded, hopeless.
      She could not honor the man who took her thus. She felt, in all the
      conscientious purity of her youth, that distinction, subtle in appearance
      but sacredly true, legal with the heart&rsquo;s legality, which women apply
      instinctively to all their feelings, even the least reflective. Juana
      became profoundly sad as she saw the nature and the extent of the life
      before her. Often she turned her eyes, brimming with tears proudly
      repressed, upon Perez and Dona Lagounia, who fully comprehended, both of
      them, the bitter thoughts those tears contained. But they were silent: of
      what good were reproaches now; why look for consolations? The deeper they
      were, the more they enlarged the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, Juana, stupid with grief, heard through the open door of her
      little room, which the old couple had thought shut, a pitying moan from
      her adopted mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child will die of grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Perez, in a shaking voice, &ldquo;but what can we do? I cannot now
      boast of her beauty and her chastity to Comte d&rsquo;Arcos, to whom I hoped to
      marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a single fault is not vice,&rdquo; said the old woman, pitying as the
      angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother gave her to this man,&rdquo; said Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a moment; without consulting the poor child!&rdquo; cried Dona
      Lagounia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knew what she was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh! into what hands our pearl is going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, or I shall seek a quarrel with that Diard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that would only lead to other miseries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these dreadful words Juana saw the happy future she had lost by
      her own wrongdoing. The pure and simple years of her quiet life would have
      been rewarded by a brilliant existence such as she had fondly dreamed,&mdash;dreams
      which had caused her ruin. To fall from the height of Greatness to
      Monsieur Diard! She wept. At times she went nearly mad. She floated for a
      while between vice and religion. Vice was a speedy solution, religion a
      lifetime of suffering. The meditation was stormy and solemn. The next day
      was the fatal day, the day for the marriage. But Juana could still remain
      free. Free, she knew how far her misery would go; married, she was
      ignorant of where it went or what it might bring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion triumphed. Dona Lagounia stayed beside her child and prayed and
      watched as she would have prayed and watched beside the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God wills it,&rdquo; she said to Juana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature gives to woman alternately a strength which enables her to suffer
      and a weakness which leads her to resignation. Juana resigned herself; and
      without restriction. She determined to obey her mother&rsquo;s prayer, and cross
      the desert of life to reach God&rsquo;s heaven, knowing well that no flowers
      grew for her along the way of that painful journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She married Diard. As for the quartermaster, though he had no grace in
      Juana&rsquo;s eyes, we may well absolve him. He loved her distractedly. The
      Marana, so keen to know the signs of love, had recognized in that man the
      accents of passion and the brusque nature, the generous impulses, that are
      common to Southerners. In the paroxysm of her anger and her distress she
      had thought such qualities enough for her daughter&rsquo;s happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first days of this marriage were apparently happy; or, to express one
      of those latent facts, the miseries of which are buried by women in the
      depths of their souls, Juana would not cast down her husband&rsquo;s joy,&mdash;a
      double role, dreadful to play, but to which, sooner or later, all women
      unhappily married come. This is a history impossible to recount in its
      full truth. Juana, struggling hourly against her nature, a nature both
      Spanish and Italian, having dried up the source of her tears by dint of
      weeping, was a human type, destined to represent woman&rsquo;s misery in its
      utmost expression, namely, sorrow undyingly active; the description of
      which would need such minute observations that to persons eager for
      dramatic emotions they would seem insipid. This analysis, in which every
      wife would find some one of her own sufferings, would require a volume to
      express them all; a fruitless, hopeless volume by its very nature, the
      merit of which would consist in faintest tints and delicate shadings which
      critics would declare to be effeminate and diffuse. Besides, what man
      could rightly approach, unless he bore another heart within his heart,
      those solemn and touching elegies which certain women carry with them to
      their tomb; melancholies, misunderstood even by those who cause them;
      sighs unheeded, devotions unrewarded,&mdash;on earth at least,&mdash;splendid
      silences misconstrued; vengeances withheld, disdained; generosities
      perpetually bestowed and wasted; pleasures longed for and denied; angelic
      charities secretly accomplished,&mdash;in short, all the religions of
      womanhood and its inextinguishable love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juana knew that life; fate spared her nought. She was wholly a wife, but a
      sorrowful and suffering wife; a wife incessantly wounded, yet forgiving
      always; a wife pure as a flawless diamond,&mdash;she who had the beauty
      and the glow of the diamond, and in that beauty, that glow, a vengeance in
      her hand; for she was certainly not a woman to fear the dagger added to
      her &ldquo;dot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first, inspired by a real love, by one of those passions which for the
      time being change even odious characters and bring to light all that may
      be noble in a soul, Diard behaved like a man of honor. He forced
      Montefiore to leave the regiment and even the army corps, so that his wife
      might never meet him during the time they remained in Spain. Next, he
      petitioned for his own removal, and succeeded in entering the Imperial
      Guard. He desired at any price to obtain a title, honors, and
      consideration in keeping with his present wealth. With this idea in his
      mind, he behaved courageously in one of the most bloody battles in
      Germany, but, unfortunately, he was too severely wounded to remain in the
      service. Threatened with the loss of a leg, he was forced to retire on a
      pension, without the title of baron, without those rewards he hoped to
      win, and would have won had he not been Diard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event, this wound, and his thwarted hopes contributed to change his
      character. His Provencal energy, roused for a time, sank down. At first he
      was sustained by his wife, in whom his efforts, his courage, his ambition
      had induced some belief in his nature, and who showed herself, what women
      are, tender and consoling in the troubles of life. Inspired by a few words
      from Juana, the retired soldier came to Paris, resolved to win in an
      administrative career a position to command respect, bury in oblivion the
      quartermaster of the 6th of the line, and secure for Madame Diard a noble
      title. His passion for that seductive creature enabled him to divine her
      most secret wishes. Juana expressed nothing, but he understood her. He was
      not loved as a lover dreams of being loved; he knew this, and he strove to
      make himself respected, loved, and cherished. He foresaw a coming
      happiness, poor man, in the patience and gentleness shown on all occasions
      by his wife; but that patience, that gentleness, were only the outward
      signs of the resignation which had made her his wife. Resignation,
      religion, were they love? Often Diard wished for refusal where he met with
      chaste obedience; often he would have given his eternal life that Juana
      might have wept upon his bosom and not disguised her secret thoughts
      behind a smiling face which lied to him nobly. Many young men&mdash;for
      after a certain age men no longer struggle&mdash;persist in the effort to
      triumph over an evil fate, the thunder of which they hear, from time to
      time, on the horizon of their lives; and when at last they succumb and
      roll down the precipice of evil, we ought to do them justice and
      acknowledge these inward struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many men Diard tried all things, and all things were hostile to him.
      His wealth enabled him to surround his wife with the enjoyments of
      Parisian luxury. She lived in a fine house, with noble rooms, where she
      maintained a salon, in which abounded artists (by nature no judges of
      men), men of pleasure ready to amuse themselves anywhere, a few
      politicians who swelled the numbers, and certain men of fashion, all of
      whom admired Juana. Those who put themselves before the eyes of the public
      in Paris must either conquer Paris or be subject to it. Diard&rsquo;s character
      was not sufficiently strong, compact, or persistent to command society at
      that epoch, because it was an epoch when all men were endeavoring to rise.
      Social classifications ready-made are perhaps a great boon even for the
      people. Napoleon has confided to us the pains he took to inspire respect
      in his court, where most of the courtiers had been his equals. But
      Napoleon was Corsican, and Diard Provencal. Given equal genius, an
      islander will always be more compact and rounded than the man of terra
      firma in the same latitude; the arm of the sea which separates Corsica
      from Provence is, in spite of human science, an ocean which has made two
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard&rsquo;s mongrel position, which he himself made still more questionable,
      brought him great troubles. Perhaps there is useful instruction to be
      derived from the almost imperceptible connection of acts which led to the
      finale of this history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the sneerers of Paris did not see without malicious
      smiles and words the pictures with which the former quartermaster adorned
      his handsome mansion. Works of art purchased the night before were said to
      be spoils from Spain; and this accusation was the revenge of those who
      were jealous of his present fortune. Juana comprehended this reproach, and
      by her advice Diard sent back to Tarragona all the pictures he had brought
      from there. But the public, determined to see things in the worst light,
      only said, &ldquo;That Diard is shrewd; he has sold his pictures.&rdquo; Worthy people
      continued to think that those which remained in the Diard salons were not
      honorably acquired. Some jealous women asked how it was that a <i>Diard</i>
      (!) had been able to marry so rich and beautiful a young girl. Hence
      comments and satires without end, such as Paris contributes. And yet, it
      must be said, that Juana met on all sides the respect inspired by her pure
      and religious life, which triumphed over everything, even Parisian
      calumny; but this respect stopped short with her, her husband received
      none of it. Juana&rsquo;s feminine perception and her keen eye hovering over her
      salons, brought her nothing but pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of esteem was perfectly natural. Diard&rsquo;s comrades, in spite of
      the virtues which our imaginations attribute to soldiers, never forgave
      the former quartermaster of the 6th of the line for becoming suddenly so
      rich and for attempting to cut a figure in Paris. Now in Paris, from the
      last house in the faubourg Saint-Germain to the last in the rue
      Saint-Lazare, between the heights of the Luxembourg and the heights of
      Montmartre, all that clothes itself and gabbles, clothes itself to go out
      and goes out to gabble. All that world of great and small pretensions,
      that world of insolence and humble desires, of envy and cringing, all that
      is gilded or tarnished, young or old, noble of yesterday or noble from the
      fourth century, all that sneers at a parvenu, all that fears to commit
      itself, all that wants to demolish power and worships power if it resists,&mdash;<i>all</i>
      those ears hear, <i>all</i> those tongues say, <i>all</i> those minds
      know, in a single evening, where the new-comer who aspires to honor among
      them was born and brought up, and what that interloper has done, or has
      not done, in the course of his life. There may be no court of assizes for
      the upper classes of society; but at any rate they have the most cruel of
      public prosecutors, an intangible moral being, both judge and executioner,
      who accuses and brands. Do not hope to hide anything from him; tell him
      all yourself; he wants to know all and he will know all. Do not ask what
      mysterious telegraph it was which conveyed to him in the twinkling of an
      eye, at any hour, in any place, that story, that bit of news, that
      scandal; do not ask what prompts him. That telegraph is a social mystery;
      no observer can report its effects. Of many extraordinary instances
      thereof, one may suffice: The assassination of the Duc de Berry, which
      occurred at the Opera-house, was related within ten minutes in the
      Ile-Saint-Louis. Thus the opinion of the 6th of the line as to its
      quartermaster filtered through society the night on which he gave his
      first ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard was therefore debarred from succeeding in society. Henceforth his
      wife alone had the power to make anything of him. Miracle of our strange
      civilization! In Paris, if a man is incapable of being anything himself,
      his wife, when she is young and clever, may give him other chances for
      elevation. We sometimes meet with invalid women, feeble beings apparently,
      who, without rising from sofas or leaving their chambers, have ruled
      society, moved a thousand springs, and placed their husbands where their
      ambition or their vanity prompted. But Juana, whose childhood was passed
      in her retreat in Tarragona, knew nothing of the vices, the meannesses, or
      the resources of Parisian society; she looked at that society with the
      curiosity of a girl, but she learned from it only that which her sorrow
      and her wounded pride revealed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juana had the tact of a virgin heart which receives impressions in advance
      of the event, after the manner of what are called &ldquo;sensitives.&rdquo; The
      solitary young girl, so suddenly become a woman and a wife, saw plainly
      that were she to attempt to compel society to respect her husband, it must
      be after the manner of Spanish beggars, carbine in hand. Besides, the
      multiplicity of the precautions she would have to take, would they meet
      the necessity? Suddenly she divined society as, once before, she had
      divined life, and she saw nothing around her but the immense extent of an
      irreparable disaster. She had, moreover, the additional grief of tardily
      recognizing her husband&rsquo;s peculiar form of incapacity; he was a man
      unfitted for any purpose that required continuity of ideas. He could not
      understand a consistent part, such as he ought to play in the world; he
      perceived it neither as a whole nor in its gradations, and its gradations
      were everything. He was in one of those positions where shrewdness and
      tact might have taken the place of strength; when shrewdness and tact
      succeed, they are, perhaps, the highest form of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Diard, far from arresting the spot of oil on his garments left by his
      antecedents, did his best to spread it. Incapable of studying the phase of
      the empire in the midst of which he came to live in Paris, he wanted to be
      made prefect. At that time every one believed in the genius of Napoleon;
      his favor enhanced the value of all offices. Prefectures, those miniature
      empires, could only be filled by men of great names, or chamberlains of
      H.M. the emperor and king. Already the prefects were a species of vizier.
      The myrmidons of the great man scoffed at Diard&rsquo;s pretensions to a
      prefecture, whereupon he lowered his demand to a sub-prefecture. There
      was, of course, a ridiculous discrepancy between this latter demand and
      the magnitude of his fortune. To frequent the imperial salons and live
      with insolent luxury, and then to abandon that millionaire life and bury
      himself as sub-prefect at Issoudun or Savenay was certainly holding
      himself below his position. Juana, too late aware of our laws and habits
      and administrative customs, did not enlighten her husband soon enough.
      Diard, desperate, petitioned successively all the ministerial powers;
      repulsed everywhere, he found nothing open to him; and society then judged
      him as the government judged him and as he judged himself. Diard,
      grievously wounded on the battlefield, was nevertheless not decorated; the
      quartermaster, rich as he was, was allowed no place in public life, and
      society logically refused him that to which he pretended in its midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, to cap all, the luckless man felt in his own home the superiority
      of his wife. Though she used great tact&mdash;we might say velvet softness
      if the term were admissible&mdash;to disguise from her husband this
      supremacy, which surprised and humiliated herself, Diard ended by being
      affected by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a game of life like this men are either unmanned, or they grow the
      stronger, or they give themselves to evil. The courage or the ardor of
      this man lessened under the reiterated blows which his own faults dealt to
      his self-appreciation, and fault after fault he committed. In the first
      place he had to struggle against his own habits and character. A
      passionate Provencal, frank in his vices as in his virtues, this man whose
      fibres vibrated like the strings of a harp, was all heart to his former
      friends. He succored the shabby and spattered man as readily as the needy
      of rank; in short, he accepted everybody, and gave his hand in his gilded
      salons to many a poor devil. Observing this on one occasion, a general of
      the empire, a variety of the human species of which no type will presently
      remain, refused his hand to Diard, and called him, insolently, &ldquo;my good
      fellow&rdquo; when he met him. The few persons of really good society whom Diard
      knew, treated him with that elegant, polished contempt against which a
      new-made man has seldom any weapons. The manners, the semi-Italian
      gesticulations, the speech of Diard, his style of dress,&mdash;all
      contributed to repulse the respect which careful observation of matters of
      good taste and dignity might otherwise obtain for vulgar persons; the yoke
      of such conventionalities can only be cast off by great and unthinkable
      powers. So goes the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      These details but faintly picture the many tortures to which Juana was
      subjected; they came upon her one by one; each social nature pricked her
      with its own particular pin; and to a soul which preferred the thrust of a
      dagger, there could be no worse suffering than this struggle in which
      Diard received insults he did not feel and Juana felt those she did not
      receive. A moment came, an awful moment, when she gained a clear and lucid
      perception of society, and felt in one instant all the sorrows which were
      gathering themselves together to fall upon her head. She judged her
      husband incapable of rising to the honored ranks of the social order, and
      she felt that he would one day descend to where his instincts led him.
      Henceforth Juana felt pity for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The future was very gloomy for this young woman. She lived in constant
      apprehension of some disaster. This presentiment was in her soul as a
      contagion is in the air, but she had strength of mind and will to disguise
      her anguish beneath a smile. Juana had ceased to think of herself. She
      used her influence to make Diard resign his various pretensions and to
      show him, as a haven, the peaceful and consoling life of home. Evils came
      from society&mdash;why not banish it? In his home Diard found peace and
      respect; he reigned there. She felt herself strong to accept the trying
      task of making him happy,&mdash;he, a man dissatisfied with himself. Her
      energy increased with the difficulties of life; she had all the secret
      heroism necessary to her position; religion inspired her with those
      desires which support the angel appointed to protect a Christian soul&mdash;occult
      poesy, allegorical image of our two natures!
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard abandoned his projects, closed his house to the world, and lived in
      his home. But here he found another reef. The poor soldier had one of
      those eccentric souls which need perpetual motion. Diard was one of the
      men who are instinctively compelled to start again the moment they arrive,
      and whose vital object seems to be to come and go incessantly, like the
      wheels mentioned in Holy Writ. Perhaps he felt the need of flying from
      himself. Without wearying of Juana, without blaming Juana, his passion for
      her, rendered tranquil by time, allowed his natural character to assert
      itself. Henceforth his days of gloom were more frequent, and he often gave
      way to southern excitement. The more virtuous a woman is and the more
      irreproachable, the more a man likes to find fault with her, if only to
      assert by that act his legal superiority. But if by chance she seems
      really imposing to him, he feels the need of foisting faults upon her.
      After that, between man and wife, trifles increase and grow till they
      swell to Alps.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Juana, patient and without pride, gentle and without that bitterness
      which women know so well how to cast into their submission, left Diard no
      chance for planned ill-humor. Besides, she was one of those noble
      creatures to whom it is impossible to speak disrespectfully; her glance,
      in which her life, saintly and pure, shone out, had the weight of a
      fascination. Diard, embarrassed at first, then annoyed, ended by feeling
      that such high virtue was a yoke upon him. The goodness of his wife gave
      him no violent emotions, and violent emotions were what he wanted. What
      myriads of scenes are played in the depths of his souls, beneath the cold
      exterior of lives that are, apparently, commonplace! Among these dramas,
      lasting each but a short time, though they influence life so powerfully
      and are frequently the forerunners of the great misfortune doomed to fall
      on so many marriages, it is difficult to choose an example. There was a
      scene, however, which particularly marked the moment when in the life of
      this husband and wife estrangement began. Perhaps it may also serve to
      explain the finale of this narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juana had two children, happily for her, two sons. The first was born
      seven months after her marriage. He was called Juan, and he strongly
      resembled his mother. The second was born about two years after her
      arrival in Paris. The latter resembled both Diard and Juana, but more
      particularly Diard. His name was Francisque. For the last five years
      Francisque had been the object of Juana&rsquo;s most tender and watchful care.
      The mother was constantly occupied with that child; to him her prettiest
      caresses; to him the toys, but to him, especially, the penetrating
      mother-looks. Juana had watched him from his cradle; she had studied his
      cries, his motions; she endeavored to discern his nature that she might
      educate him wisely. It seemed at times as if she had but that one child.
      Diard, seeing that the eldest, Juan, was in a way neglected, took him
      under his own protection; and without inquiring even of himself whether
      the boy was the fruit of that ephemeral love to which he owed his wife, he
      made him his Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the sentiments transmitted to her through the blood of her
      grandmothers which consumed her, Madame Diard accepted one alone, &mdash;maternal
      love. But she loved her children doubly: first with the noble violence of
      which her mother the Marana had given her the example; secondly, with
      grace and purity, in the spirit of those social virtues the practice of
      which was the glory of her life and her inward recompense. The secret
      thought, the conscience of her motherhood, which gave to the Marana&rsquo;s life
      its stamp of untaught poesy, was to Juana an acknowledged life, an open
      consolation at all hours. Her mother had been virtuous as other women are
      criminal,&mdash;in secret; she had stolen a fancied happiness, she had
      never really tasted it. But Juana, unhappy in her virtue as her mother was
      unhappy in her vice, could enjoy at all moments the ineffable delights
      which her mother had so craved and could not have. To her, as to her
      mother, maternity comprised all earthly sentiments. Each, from differing
      causes, had no other comfort in their misery. Juana&rsquo;s maternal love may
      have been the strongest because, deprived of all other affections, she put
      the joys she lacked into the one joy of her children; and there are noble
      passions that resemble vice; the more they are satisfied the more they
      increase. Mothers and gamblers are alike insatiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Juana saw the generous pardon laid silently on the head of Juan by
      Diard&rsquo;s fatherly affection, she was much moved, and from the day when the
      husband and wife changed parts she felt for him the true and deep interest
      she had hitherto shown to him as a matter of duty only. If that man had
      been more consistent in his life; if he had not destroyed by fitful
      inconstancy and restlessness the forces of a true though excitable
      sensibility, Juana would doubtless have loved him in the end.
      Unfortunately, he was a type of those southern natures which are keen in
      perceptions they cannot follow out; capable of great things over-night,
      and incapable the next morning; often the victim of their own virtues, and
      often lucky through their worst passions; admirable men in some respects,
      when their good qualities are kept to a steady energy by some outward
      bond. For two years after his retreat from active life Diard was held
      captive in his home by the softest chains. He lived, almost in spite of
      himself, under the influence of his wife, who made herself gay and amusing
      to cheer him, who used the resources of feminine genius to attract and
      seduce him to a love of virtue, but whose ability and cleverness did not
      go so far as to simulate love.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time all Paris was talking of the affair of a captain in the army
      who in a paroxysm of libertine jealousy had killed a woman. Diard, on
      coming home to dinner, told his wife that the officer was dead. He had
      killed himself to avoid the dishonor of a trial and the shame of death
      upon the scaffold. Juana did not see at first the logic of such conduct,
      and her husband was obliged to explain to her the fine jurisprudence of
      French law, which does not prosecute the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, papa, didn&rsquo;t you tell us the other day that the king could pardon?&rdquo;
       asked Francisque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king can give nothing but life,&rdquo; said Juan, half scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard and Juana, the spectators of this little scene, were differently
      affected by it. The glance, moist with joy, which his wife cast upon her
      eldest child was a fatal revelation to the husband of the secrets of a
      heart hitherto impenetrable. That eldest child was all Juana; Juana
      comprehended him; she was sure of his heart, his future; she adored him,
      but her ardent love was a secret between herself, her child, and God. Juan
      instinctively enjoyed the seeming indifference of his mother in presence
      of his father and brother, for she pressed him to her heart when alone.
      Francisque was Diard, and Juana&rsquo;s incessant care and watchfulness betrayed
      her desire to correct in the son the vices of the father and to encourage
      his better qualities. Juana, unaware that her glance had said too much and
      that her husband had rightly interpreted it, took Francisque in her lap
      and gave him, in a gentle voice still trembling with the pleasure that
      Juan&rsquo;s answer had brought her, a lesson upon honor, simplified to his
      childish intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s character requires care,&rdquo; said Diard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about Juan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Diard, struck by the tone in which the words were uttered, looked
      at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juan was born perfect,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down gloomily, and reflected. Presently, as his wife continued
      silent, he added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love one of <i>your</i> children better than the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Diard, &ldquo;I did not know until now which of them you preferred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But neither of them have ever given me a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness,&rdquo; she
      answered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one of them gives you greater joys,&rdquo; he said, more quickly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never counted them,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How false you women are!&rdquo; cried Diard. &ldquo;Will you dare to say that Juan is
      not the child of your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that were so,&rdquo; she said, with dignity, &ldquo;do you think it a misfortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never loved me. If you had chosen, I would have conquered worlds
      for your sake. You know all that I have struggled to do in life, supported
      by the hope of pleasing you. Ah! if you had only loved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman who loves,&rdquo; said Juana, &ldquo;likes to live in solitude, far from the
      world, and that is what we are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Juana, that <i>you</i> are never in the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were said bitterly, and cast, for the rest of their lives
      together, a coldness between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow of that fatal day Diard went back to his old companions and
      found distractions for his mind in play. Unfortunately, he won much money,
      and continued playing. Little by little, he returned to the dissipated
      life he had formerly lived. Soon he ceased even to dine in his own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some months went by in the enjoyment of this new independence; he was
      determined to preserve it, and in order to do so he separated himself from
      his wife, giving her the large apartments and lodging himself in the
      entresol. By the end of the year Diard and Juana only saw each other in
      the morning at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all gamblers, he had his alternations of loss and gain. Not wishing
      to cut into the capital of his fortune, he felt the necessity of
      withdrawing from his wife the management of their income; and the day came
      when he took from her all she had hitherto freely disposed of for the
      household benefit, giving her instead a monthly stipend. The conversation
      they had on this subject was the last of their married intercourse. The
      silence that fell between them was a true divorce; Juana comprehended that
      from henceforth she was only a mother, and she was glad, not seeking for
      the causes of this evil. For such an event is a great evil. Children are
      conjointly one with husband and wife in the home, and the life of her
      husband could not be a source of grief and injury to Juana only.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Diard, now emancipated, he speedily grew accustomed to win and lose
      enormous sums. A fine player and a heavy player, he soon became celebrated
      for his style of playing. The social consideration he had been unable to
      win under the Empire, he acquired under the Restoration by the rolling of
      his gold on the green cloth and by his talent for all games that were in
      vogue. Ambassadors, bankers, persons with newly-acquired large fortunes,
      and all those men who, having sucked life to the dregs, turn to gambling
      for its feverish joys, admired Diard at their clubs,&mdash;seldom in their
      own houses,&mdash;and they all gambled with him. He became the fashion.
      Two or three times during the winter he gave a fete as a matter of social
      pride in return for the civilities he received. At such times Juana once
      more caught a glimpse of the world of balls, festivities, luxury, and
      lights; but for her it was a sort of tax imposed upon the comfort of her
      solitude. She, the queen of these solemnities, appeared like a being
      fallen from some other planet. Her simplicity, which nothing had
      corrupted, her beautiful virginity of soul, which her peaceful life
      restored to her, her beauty and her true modesty, won her sincere homage.
      But observing how few women ever entered her salons, she came to
      understand that though her husband was following, without communicating
      its nature to her, a new line of conduct, he had gained nothing actually
      in the world&rsquo;s esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard was not always lucky; far from it. In three years he had dissipated
      three fourths of his fortune, but his passion for play gave him the energy
      to continue it. He was intimate with a number of men, more particularly
      with the roues of the Bourse, men who, since the revolution, have set up
      the principle that robbery done on a large scale is only a <i>smirch</i>
      to the reputation,&mdash;transferring thus to financial matters the loose
      principles of love in the eighteenth century. Diard now became a sort of
      business man, and concerned himself in several of those affairs which are
      called <i>shady</i> in the slang of the law-courts. He practised the
      decent thievery by which so many men, cleverly masked, or hidden in the
      recesses of the political world, make their fortunes,&mdash;thievery
      which, if done in the streets by the light of an oil lamp, would see a
      poor devil to the galleys, but, under gilded ceilings and by the light of
      candelabra, is sanctioned. Diard brought up, monopolized, and sold sugars;
      he sold offices; he had the glory of inventing the &ldquo;man of straw&rdquo; for
      lucrative posts which it was necessary to keep in his own hands for a
      short time; he bought votes, receiving, on one occasion, so much per cent
      on the purchase of fifteen parliamentary votes which all passed on one
      division from the benches of the Left to the benches of the Right. Such
      actions are no longer crimes or thefts,&mdash;they are called governing,
      developing industry, becoming a financial power. Diard was placed by
      public opinion on the bench of infamy where many an able man was already
      seated. On that bench is the aristocracy of evil. It is the upper Chamber
      of scoundrels of high life. Diard was, therefore, not a mere commonplace
      gambler who is seen to be a blackguard, and ends by begging. That style of
      gambler is no longer seen in society of a certain topographical height. In
      these days bold scoundrels die brilliantly in the chariot of vice with the
      trappings of luxury. Diard, at least, did not buy his remorse at a low
      price; he made himself one of these privileged men. Having studied the
      machinery of government and learned all the secrets and the passions of
      the men in power, he was able to maintain himself in the fiery furnace
      into which he had sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Diard knew nothing of her husband&rsquo;s infernal life. Glad of his
      abandonment, she felt no curiosity about him, and all her hours were
      occupied. She devoted what money she had to the education of her children,
      wishing to make men of them, and giving them straight-forward reasons,
      without, however, taking the bloom from their young imaginations. Through
      them alone came her interests and her emotions; consequently, she suffered
      no longer from her blemished life. Her children were to her what they are
      to many mothers for a long period of time,&mdash;a sort of renewal of
      their own existence. Diard was now an accidental circumstance, not a
      participator in her life, and since he had ceased to be the father and the
      head of the family, Juana felt bound to him by no tie other than that
      imposed by conventional laws. Nevertheless, she brought up her children to
      the highest respect for paternal authority, however imaginary it was for
      them. In this she was greatly seconded by her husband&rsquo;s continual absence.
      If he had been much in the home Diard would have neutralized his wife&rsquo;s
      efforts. The boys had too much intelligence and shrewdness not to have
      judged their father; and to judge a father is moral parricide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long run, however, Juana&rsquo;s indifference to her husband wore itself
      away; it even changed to a species of fear. She understood at last how the
      conduct of a father might long weigh on the future of her children, and
      her motherly solicitude brought her many, though incomplete, revelations
      of the truth. From day to day the dread of some unknown but inevitable
      evil in the shadow of which she lived became more and more keen and
      terrible. Therefore, during the rare moments when Diard and Juana met she
      would cast upon his hollow face, wan from nights of gambling and furrowed
      by emotions, a piercing look, the penetration of which made Diard shudder.
      At such times the assumed gaiety of her husband alarmed Juana more than
      his gloomiest expressions of anxiety when, by chance, he forgot that
      assumption of joy. Diard feared his wife as a criminal fears the
      executioner. In him, Juana saw her children&rsquo;s shame; and in her Diard
      dreaded a calm vengeance, the judgment of that serene brow, an arm raised,
      a weapon ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      After fifteen years of marriage Diard found himself without resources. He
      owed three hundred thousand francs and he could scarcely muster one
      hundred thousand. The house, his only visible possession, was mortgaged to
      its fullest selling value. A few days more, and the sort of prestige with
      which opulence had invested him would vanish. Not a hand would be offered,
      not a purse would be open to him. Unless some favorable event occurred he
      would fall into a slough of contempt, deeper perhaps than he deserved,
      precisely because he had mounted to a height he could not maintain. At
      this juncture he happened to hear that a number of strangers of
      distinction, diplomats and others, were assembled at the watering-places
      in the Pyrenees, where they gambled for enormous sums, and were doubtless
      well supplied with money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to go at once to the Pyrenees; but he would not leave his
      wife in Paris, lest some importunate creditor might reveal to her the
      secret of his horrible position. He therefore took her and the two
      children with him, refusing to allow her to take the tutor and scarcely
      permitting her to take a maid. His tone was curt and imperious; he seemed
      to have recovered some energy. This sudden journey, the cause of which
      escaped her penetration, alarmed Juana secretly. Her husband made it
      gaily. Obliged to occupy the same carriage, he showed himself day by day
      more attentive to the children and more amiable to their mother.
      Nevertheless, each day brought Juana dark presentiments, the presentiments
      of mothers who tremble without apparent reason, but who are seldom
      mistaken when they tremble thus. For them the veil of the future seems
      thinner than for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bordeaux, Diard hired in a quiet street a quiet little house, neatly
      furnished, and in it he established his wife. The house was at the corner
      of two streets, and had a garden. Joined to the neighboring house on one
      side only, it was open to view and accessible on the other three sides.
      Diard paid the rent in advance, and left Juana barely enough money for the
      necessary expenses of three months, a sum not exceeding a thousand francs.
      Madame Diard made no observation on this unusual meanness. When her
      husband told her that he was going to the watering-places and that she
      would stay at Bordeaux, Juana offered no difficulty, and at once formed a
      plan to teach the children Spanish and Italian, and to make them read the
      two masterpieces of the two languages. She was glad to lead a retired
      life, simply and naturally economical. To spare herself the troubles of
      material life, she arranged with a &ldquo;traiteur&rdquo; the day after Diard&rsquo;s
      departure to send in their meals. Her maid then sufficed for the service
      of the house, and she thus found herself without money, but her wants all
      provided for until her husband&rsquo;s return. Her pleasures consisted in taking
      walks with the children. She was then thirty-three years old. Her beauty,
      greatly developed, was in all its lustre. Therefore as soon as she
      appeared, much talk was made in Bordeaux about the beautiful Spanish
      stranger. At the first advances made to her Juana ceased to walk abroad,
      and confined herself wholly to her own large garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard at first made a fortune at the baths. In two months he won three
      hundred thousand dollars, but it never occurred to him to send any money
      to his wife; he kept it all, expecting to make some great stroke of
      fortune on a vast stake. Towards the end of the second month the Marquis
      de Montefiore appeared at the same baths. The marquis was at this time
      celebrated for his wealth, his handsome face, his fortunate marriage with
      an Englishwoman, and more especially for his love of play. Diard, his
      former companion, encountered him, and desired to add his spoils to those
      of others. A gambler with four hundred thousand francs in hand is always
      in a position to do as he pleases. Diard, confident in his luck, renewed
      acquaintance with Montefiore. The latter received him very coldly, but
      nevertheless they played together, and Diard lost every penny that he
      possessed, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Montefiore,&rdquo; said the ex-quartermaster, after making a tour of
      the salon, &ldquo;I owe you a hundred thousand francs; but my money is in
      Bordeaux, where I have left my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diard had the money in bank-bills in his pocket; but with the
      self-possession and rapid bird&rsquo;s-eye view of a man accustomed to catch at
      all resources, he still hoped to recover himself by some one of the
      endless caprices of play. Montefiore had already mentioned his intention
      of visiting Bordeaux. Had he paid his debt on the spot, Diard would have
      been left without the power to take his revenge; a revenge at cards often
      exceeds the amount of all preceding losses. But these burning expectations
      depended on the marquis&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Montefiore, &ldquo;and we will go together to
      Bordeaux. In all conscience, I am rich enough to-day not to wish to take
      the money of an old comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Diard and Montefiore were in Bordeaux at a gambling
      table. Diard, having won enough to pay his hundred thousand francs, went
      on until he had lost two hundred thousand more on his word. He was gay as
      a man who swam in gold. Eleven o&rsquo;clock sounded; the night was superb.
      Montefiore may have felt, like Diard, a desire to breathe the open air and
      recover from such emotions in a walk. The latter proposed to the marquis
      to come home with him to take a cup of tea and get his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Madame Diard?&rdquo; said Montefiore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down-stairs; but before taking his hat Diard entered the
      dining-room of the establishment and asked for a glass of water. While it
      was being brought, he walked up and down the room, and was able, without
      being noticed, to pick up one of those small sharp-pointed steel knives
      with pearl handles which are used for cutting fruit at dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; said Montefiore, in the courtyard, &ldquo;for I want to
      send a carriage there to fetch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diard told him the exact address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Montefiore, in a low voice, taking Diard&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;that as
      long as I am with you I have nothing to fear; but if I came home alone and
      a scoundrel were to follow me, I should be profitable to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you much with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not much,&rdquo; said the wary Italian, &ldquo;only my winnings. But they would
      make a pretty fortune for a beggar and turn him into an honest man for the
      rest of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diard led the marquis along a lonely street where he remembered to have
      seen a house, the door of which was at the end of an avenue of trees with
      high and gloomy walls on either side of it. When they reached this spot he
      coolly invited the marquis to precede him; but as if the latter understood
      him he preferred to keep at his side. Then, no sooner were they fairly in
      the avenue, then Diard, with the agility of a tiger, tripped up the
      marquis with a kick behind the knees, and putting a foot on his neck
      stabbed him again and again to the heart till the blade of the knife broke
      in it. Then he searched Montefiore&rsquo;s pockets, took his wallet, money,
      everything. But though he had taken the Italian unawares, and had done the
      deed with lucid mind and the quickness of a pickpocket, Montefiore had
      time to cry &ldquo;Murder! Help!&rdquo; in a shrill and piercing voice which was fit
      to rouse every sleeper in the neighborhood. His last sighs were given in
      those horrible shrieks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard was not aware that at the moment when they entered the avenue a
      crowd just issuing from a theatre was passing at the upper end of the
      street. The cries of the dying man reached them, though Diard did his best
      to stifle the noise by setting his foot firmly on Montefiore&rsquo;s neck. The
      crowd began to run towards the avenue, the high walls of which appeared to
      echo back the cries, directing them to the very spot where the crime was
      committed. The sound of their coming steps seemed to beat on Diard&rsquo;s
      brain. But not losing his head as yet, the murderer left the avenue and
      came boldly into the street, walking very gently, like a spectator who
      sees the inutility of trying to give help. He even turned round once or
      twice to judge of the distance between himself and the crowd, and he saw
      them rushing up the avenue, with the exception of one man, who, with a
      natural sense of caution, began to watch Diard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is! there he is!&rdquo; cried the people, who had entered the avenue
      as soon as they saw Montefiore stretched out near the door of the empty
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as that clamor rose, Diard, feeling himself well in the advance,
      began to run or rather to fly, with the vigor of a lion and the bounds of
      a deer. At the other end of the street he saw, or fancied he saw, a mass
      of persons, and he dashed down a cross street to avoid them. But already
      every window was open, and heads were thrust forth right and left, while
      from every door came shouts and gleams of light. Diard kept on, going
      straight before him, through the lights and the noise; and his legs were
      so actively agile that he soon left the tumult behind him, though without
      being able to escape some eyes which took in the extent of his course more
      rapidly than he could cover it. Inhabitants, soldiers, gendarmes, every
      one, seemed afoot in the twinkling of an eye. Some men awoke the
      commissaries of police, others stayed by the body to guard it. The pursuit
      kept on in the direction of the fugitive, who dragged it after him like
      the flame of a conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diard, as he ran, had all the sensations of a dream when he heard a whole
      city howling, running, panting after him. Nevertheless, he kept his ideas
      and his presence of mind. Presently he reached the wall of the garden of
      his house. The place was perfectly silent, and he thought he had foiled
      his pursuers, though a distant murmur of the tumult came to his ears like
      the roaring of the sea. He dipped some water from a brook and drank it.
      Then, observing a pile of stones on the road, he hid his treasure in it;
      obeying one of those vague thoughts which come to criminals at a moment
      when the faculty to judge their actions under all bearings deserts them,
      and they think to establish their innocence by want of proof of their
      guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, he endeavored to assume a placid countenance; he even tried to
      smile as he rapped softly on the door of his house, hoping that no one saw
      him. He raised his eyes, and through the outer blinds of one window came a
      gleam of light from his wife&rsquo;s room. Then, in the midst of his trouble,
      visions of her gentle life, spent with her children, beat upon his brain
      with the force of a hammer. The maid opened the door, which Diard hastily
      closed behind him with a kick. For a moment he breathed freely; then,
      noticing that he was bathed in perspiration, he sent the servant back to
      Juana and stayed in the darkness of the passage, where he wiped his face
      with his handkerchief and put his clothes in order, like a dandy about to
      pay a visit to a pretty woman. After that he walked into a track of the
      moonlight to examine his hands. A quiver of joy passed over him as he saw
      that no blood stains were on them; the hemorrhage from his victim&rsquo;s body
      was no doubt inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this took time. When at last he mounted the stairs to Juana&rsquo;s room
      he was calm and collected, and able to reflect on his position, which
      resolved itself into two ideas: to leave the house, and get to the
      wharves. He did not <i>think</i> these ideas, he <i>saw</i> them written
      in fiery letters on the darkness. Once at the wharves he could hide all
      day, return at night for his treasure, then conceal himself, like a rat,
      in the hold of some vessel and escape without any one suspecting his
      whereabouts. But to do all this, money, gold, was his first necessity,&mdash;and
      he did not possess one penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid brought a light to show him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felicie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you hear a noise in the street, shouts, cries?
      Go and see what it means, and come and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife, in her white dressing-gown, was sitting at a table, reading
      aloud to Francisque and Juan from a Spanish Cervantes, while the boys
      followed her pronunciation of the words from the text. They all three
      stopped and looked at Diard, who stood in the doorway with his hands in
      his pockets; overcome, perhaps, by finding himself in this calm scene, so
      softly lighted, so beautiful with the faces of his wife and children. It
      was a living picture of the Virgin between her son and John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana, I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; she asked, instantly perceiving from the livid
      paleness of her husband that the misfortune she had daily expected was
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing; but I want to speak to you&mdash;to you, alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he glanced at his sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dears, go to your room, and go to bed,&rdquo; said Juana; &ldquo;say your prayers
      without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys left the room in silence, with the incurious obedience of
      well-trained children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Juana,&rdquo; said Diard, in a coaxing voice, &ldquo;I left you with very
      little money, and I regret it now. Listen to me; since I relieved you of
      the care of our income by giving you an allowance, have you not, like
      other women, laid something by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Juana, &ldquo;I have nothing. In making that allowance you did not
      reckon the costs of the children&rsquo;s education. I don&rsquo;t say that to reproach
      you, my friend, only to explain my want of money. All that you gave me
      went to pay masters and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried Diard, violently. &ldquo;Thunder of heaven! every instant is
      precious! Where are your jewels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well I have never worn any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s not a sou to be had here!&rdquo; cried Diard, frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you shout in that way?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have killed a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana sprang to the door of her children&rsquo;s room and closed it; then she
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sons must hear nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;With whom have you fought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montefiore,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;the only man you had the right to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were many reasons why he should die by my hand. But I can&rsquo;t lose
      time&mdash;Money, money! for God&rsquo;s sake, money! I may be pursued. We did
      not fight. I&mdash;I killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed him!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as one kills anything. He stole my whole fortune and I took it back,
      that&rsquo;s all. Juana, now that everything is quiet you must go down to that
      heap of stones&mdash;you know the heap by the garden wall&mdash;and get
      that money, since you haven&rsquo;t any in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money that you stole?&rdquo; said Juana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter to you? Have you any money to give me? I tell you I
      must get away. They are on my traces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people, the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana left the room, but returned immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, holding out to him at arm&rsquo;s length a jewel, &ldquo;that is
      Dona Lagounia&rsquo;s cross. There are four rubies in it, of great value, I have
      been told. Take it and go&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felicie hasn&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo; he cried, with a sudden thought. &ldquo;Can she have
      been arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana laid the cross on the table, and sprang to the windows that looked
      on the street. There she saw, in the moonlight, a file of soldiers posting
      themselves in deepest silence along the wall of the house. She turned,
      affecting to be calm, and said to her husband:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not a minute to lose; you must escape through the garden. Here
      is the key of the little gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a precaution she turned to the other windows, looking on the garden. In
      the shadow of the trees she saw the gleam of the silver lace on the hats
      of a body of gendarmes; and she heard the distant mutterings of a crowd of
      persons whom sentinels were holding back at the end of the streets up
      which curiosity had drawn them. Diard had, in truth, been seen to enter
      his house by persons at their windows, and on their information and that
      of the frightened maid-servant, who was arrested, the troops and the
      people had blocked the two streets which led to the house. A dozen
      gendarmes, returning from the theatre, had climbed the walls of the
      garden, and guarded all exit in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Juana, &ldquo;you cannot escape. The whole town is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diard ran from window to window with the useless activity of a captive
      bird striking against the panes to escape. Juana stood silent and
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juana, dear Juana, help me! give me, for pity&rsquo;s sake, some advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Juana, &ldquo;I will; and I will save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are always my good angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Juana left the room and returned immediately, holding out to Diard, with
      averted head, one of his own pistols. Diard did not take it. Juana heard
      the entrance of the soldiers into the courtyard, where they laid down the
      body of the murdered man to confront the assassin with the sight of it.
      She turned round and saw Diard white and livid. The man was nearly
      fainting, and tried to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your children implore you,&rdquo; she said, putting the pistol beneath his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;my good Juana, my little Juana, do you think&mdash;Juana! is it
      so pressing?&mdash;I want to kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gendarmes were mounting the staircase. Juana grasped the pistol, aimed
      it at Diard, holding him, in spite of his cries, by the throat; then she
      blew his brains out and flung the weapon on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the door was opened violently. The public prosecutor,
      followed by an examining judge, a doctor, a sheriff, and a posse of
      gendarmes, all the representatives, in short, of human justice, entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Juana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Monsieur Diard?&rdquo; said the prosecutor, pointing to the dead body
      bent double on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gown is covered with blood, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see why?&rdquo; replied Juana.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the little table and sat down, taking up the volume of
      Cervantes; she was pale, with a nervous agitation which she nevertheless
      controlled, keeping it wholly inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room,&rdquo; said the prosecutor to the gendarmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he signed to the examining judge and the doctor to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, under the circumstances, we can only congratulate you on the
      death of your husband,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At least he has died as a soldier
      should, whatever crime his passions may have led him to commit. His act
      renders negatory that of justice. But however we may desire to spare you
      at such a moment, the law requires that we should make an exact report of
      all violent deaths. You will permit us to do our duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go and change my dress?&rdquo; she asked, laying down the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; but you must bring it back to us. The doctor may need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be too painful for madame to see me operate,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      understanding the suspicions of the prosecutor. &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I
      hope you will allow her to remain in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magistrates approved the request of the merciful physician, and
      Felicie was permitted to attend her mistress. The judge and the prosecutor
      talked together in a low voice. Officers of the law are very unfortunate
      in being forced to suspect all, and to imagine evil everywhere. By dint of
      supposing wicked intentions, and of comprehending them, in order to reach
      the truth hidden under so many contradictory actions, it is impossible
      that the exercise of their dreadful functions should not, in the long run,
      dry up at their source the generous emotions they are constrained to
      repress. If the sensibilities of the surgeon who probes into the mysteries
      of the human body end by growing callous, what becomes of those of the
      judge who is incessantly compelled to search the inner folds of the soul?
      Martyrs to their mission, magistrates are all their lives in mourning for
      their lost illusions; crime weighs no less heavily on them than on the
      criminal. An old man seated on the bench is venerable, but a young judge
      makes a thoughtful person shudder. The examining judge in this case was
      young, and he felt obliged to say to the public prosecutor,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that woman was her husband&rsquo;s accomplice? Ought we to take
      her into custody? Is it best to question her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prosecutor replied, with a careless shrug of his shoulders,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montefiore and Diard were two well-known scoundrels. The maid evidently
      knew nothing of the crime. Better let the thing rest there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor performed the autopsy, and dictated his report to the sheriff.
      Suddenly he stopped, and hastily entered the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juana, who had removed her bloody gown, came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; he whispered, stooping to her ear, &ldquo;who killed your
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor returned and continued his dictation as follows,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, from the above assemblage of facts, it appears evident that the said
      Diard killed himself voluntarily and by his own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; he said to the sheriff after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor signed the report. Juana, who had followed him into the room,
      gave him one glance, repressing with difficulty the tears which for an
      instant rose into her eyes and moistened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; she said to the public prosecutor and the judge, &ldquo;I am a
      stranger here, and a Spaniard. I am ignorant of the laws, and I know no
      one in Bordeaux. I ask of you one kindness: enable me to obtain a passport
      for Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; cried the examining judge. &ldquo;Madame, what has become of the
      money stolen from the Marquis de Montefiore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Diard,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;said something to me vaguely about a heap
      of stones, under which he must have hidden it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two magistrates looked at each other. Juana made a noble gesture and
      motioned to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said in his ear, &ldquo;can I be suspected of some infamous
      action? I! The pile of stones must be close to the wall of my garden. Go
      yourself, I implore you. Look, search, find that money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went out, taking with him the examining judge, and together
      they found Montefiore&rsquo;s treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within two days Juana had sold her cross to pay the costs of a journey. On
      her way with her two children to take the diligence which would carry her
      to the frontiers of Spain, she heard herself being called in the street.
      Her dying mother was being carried to a hospital, and through the curtains
      of her litter she had seen her daughter. Juana made the bearers enter a
      porte-cochere that was near them, and there the last interview between the
      mother and the daughter took place. Though the two spoke to each other in
      a low voice, Juan heard these parting words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, die in peace; I have suffered for you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
