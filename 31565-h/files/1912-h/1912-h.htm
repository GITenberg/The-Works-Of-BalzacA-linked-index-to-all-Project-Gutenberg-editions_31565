                            DEDICATION

            To Monsieur le Comte Ferdinand de Gramont.

  MY DEAR FERDINAND,&mdash;If the chances of the world of literature
  &mdash;<i>habent sua fata libelli</i>&mdash;should allow these lines to be an
  enduring record, that will still be but a trifle in return for the
  trouble you have taken&mdash;you, the Hozier, the Cherin, the
  King-at-Arms of these Studies of Life; you, to whom the Navarreins,
  Cadignans, Langeais, Blamont-Chauvrys, Chaulieus, Arthez,
  Esgrignons, Mortsaufs, Valois&mdash;the hundred great names that form
  the Aristocracy of the &ldquo;Human Comedy&rdquo; owe their lordly mottoes and
  ingenious armorial bearings. Indeed, &ldquo;the Armorial of the Etudes,
  devised by Ferdinand de Gramont, gentleman,&rdquo; is a complete manual
  of French Heraldry, in which nothing is forgotten, not even the
  arms of the Empire, and I shall preserve it as a monument of
  friendship and of Benedictine patience. What profound knowledge of
  the old feudal spirit is to be seen in the motto of the
  Beauseants, <i>Pulchre sedens, melius agens</i>; in that of the
  Espards, <i>Des partem leonis</i>; in that of the Vandenesses, <i>Ne se
  vend</i>. And what elegance in the thousand details of the learned
  symbolism which will always show how far accuracy has been carried
  in my work, to which you, the poet, have contributed.

                                                 Your old friend,
                                                 DE BALZAC.

      THE MUSE OF THE DEPARTMENT
    </h1>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On the skirts of Le Berry stands a town which, watered by the Loire,
      infallibly attracts the traveler&rsquo;s eye. Sancerre crowns the topmost height
      of a chain of hills, the last of the range that gives variety to the
      Nivernais. The Loire floods the flats at the foot of these slopes, leaving
      a yellow alluvium that is extremely fertile, excepting in those places
      where it has deluged them with sand and destroyed them forever, by one of
      those terrible risings which are also incidental to the Vistula&mdash;the
      Loire of the northern coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hill on which the houses of Sancerre are grouped is so far from the
      river that the little river-port of Saint-Thibault thrives on the life of
      Sancerre. There wine is shipped and oak staves are landed, with all the
      produce brought from the upper and lower Loire. At the period when this
      story begins the suspension bridges at Cosne and at Saint-Thibault were
      already built. Travelers from Paris to Sancerre by the southern road were
      no longer ferried across the river from Cosne to Saint-Thibault; and this
      of itself is enough to show that the great cross-shuffle of 1830 was a
      thing of the past, for the House of Orleans has always had a care for
      substantial improvements, though somewhat after the fashion of a husband
      who makes his wife presents out of her marriage portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting that part of Sancerre which occupies the little plateau, the
      streets are more or less steep, and the town is surrounded by slopes known
      as the Great Ramparts, a name which shows that they are the highroads of
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the ramparts lies a belt of vineyards. Wine forms the chief
      industry and the most important trade of the country, which yields several
      vintages of high-class wine full of aroma, and so nearly resembling the
      wines of Burgundy, that the vulgar palate is deceived. So Sancerre finds
      in the wineshops of Paris the quick market indispensable for liquor that
      will not keep for more than seven or eight years. Below the town lie a few
      villages, Fontenoy and Saint-Satur, almost suburbs, reminding us by their
      situation of the smiling vineyards about Neuchatel in Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town still bears much of its ancient aspect; the streets are narrow
      and paved with pebbles carted up from the Loire. Some old houses are to be
      seen there. The citadel, a relic of military power and feudal times, stood
      one of the most terrible sieges of our religious wars, when French
      Calvinists far outdid the ferocious Cameronians of Walter Scott&rsquo;s tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of Sancerre, rich in its greater past, but widowed now of its
      military importance, is doomed to an even less glorious future, for the
      course of trade lies on the right bank of the Loire. The sketch here given
      shows that Sancerre will be left more and more lonely in spite of the two
      bridges connecting it with Cosne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sancerre, the pride of the left bank, numbers three thousand five hundred
      inhabitants at most, while at Cosne there are now more than six thousand.
      Within half a century the part played by these two towns standing opposite
      each other has been reversed. The advantage of situation, however, remains
      with the historic town, whence the view on every side is perfectly
      enchanting, where the air is deliciously pure, the vegetation splendid,
      and the residents, in harmony with nature, are friendly souls, good
      fellows, and devoid of Puritanism, though two-thirds of the population are
      Calvinists. Under such conditions, though there are the usual
      disadvantages of life in a small town, and each one lives under the
      officious eye which makes private life almost a public concern, on the
      other hand, the spirit of township&mdash;a sort of patriotism, which
      cannot indeed take the place of a love of home&mdash;flourishes
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the town of Sancerre is exceedingly proud of having given birth to
      one of the glories of modern medicine, Horace Bianchon, and to an author
      of secondary rank, Etienne Lousteau, one of our most successful
      journalists. The district included under the municipality of Sancerre,
      distressed at finding itself practically ruled by seven or eight large
      landowners, the wire-pullers of the elections, tried to shake off the
      electoral yoke of a creed which had reduced it to a rotten borough. This
      little conspiracy, plotted by a handful of men whose vanity was provoked,
      failed through the jealousy which the elevation of one of them, as the
      inevitable result, roused in the breasts of the others. This result showed
      the radical defect of the scheme, and the remedy then suggested was to
      rally round a champion at the next election, in the person of one of the
      two men who so gloriously represented Sancerre in Paris circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was extraordinarily advanced for the provinces, for since 1830
      the nomination of parochial dignitaries has increased so greatly that real
      statesmen are becoming rare indeed in the lower chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, this plan, of very doubtful outcome, was hatched in the
      brain of the Superior Woman of the borough, <i>dux femina fasti</i>, but
      with a view to personal interest. This idea was so widely rooted in this
      lady&rsquo;s past life, and so entirely comprehended her future prospects, that
      it can scarcely be understood without some sketch of her antecedent
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sancerre at that time could boast of a Superior Woman, long misprized
      indeed, but now, about 1836, enjoying a pretty extensive local reputation.
      This, too, was the period at which two Sancerrois in Paris were attaining,
      each in his own line, to the highest degree of glory for one, and of
      fashion for the other. Etienne Lousteau, a writer in reviews, signed his
      name to contributions to a paper that had eight thousand subscribers; and
      Bianchon, already chief physician to a hospital, Officer of the Legion of
      Honor, and member of the Academy of Sciences, had just been made a
      professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were not that the word would to many readers seem to imply a degree
      of blame, it might be said that George Sand created <i>Sandism</i>, so
      true is it that, morally speaking, all good has a reverse of evil. This
      leprosy of sentimentality would have been charming. Still, <i>Sandism</i>
      has its good side, in that the woman attacked by it bases her assumption
      of superiority on feelings scorned; she is a blue-stocking of sentiment;
      and she is rather less of a bore, love to some extent neutralizing
      literature. The most conspicuous result of George Sand&rsquo;s celebrity was to
      elicit the fact that France has a perfectly enormous number of superior
      women, who have, however, till now been so generous as to leave the field
      to the Marechal de Saxe&rsquo;s granddaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Superior Woman of Sancerre lived at La Baudraye, a town-house and
      country-house in one, within ten minutes of the town, and in the village,
      or, if you will, the suburb of Saint-Satur. The La Baudrayes of the
      present day have, as is frequently the case, thrust themselves in, and are
      but a substitute for those La Baudrayes whose name, glorious in the
      Crusades, figured in the chief events of the history of Le Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Louis XIV. a certain sheriff named Milaud, whose
      forefathers had been furious Calvinists, was converted at the time of the
      Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. To encourage this movement in one of
      the strong-holds of Calvinism, the King gave said Milaud a good
      appointment in the &ldquo;Waters and Forests,&rdquo; granted him arms and the title of
      Sire (or Lord) de la Baudraye, with the fief of the old and genuine La
      Baudrayes. The descendants of the famous Captain la Baudraye fell, sad to
      say, into one of the snares laid for heretics by the new decrees, and were
      hanged&mdash;an unworthy deed of the great King&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Louis XV. Milaud de la Baudraye, from being a mere squire, was made
      Chevalier, and had influence enough to obtain for his son a cornet&rsquo;s
      commission in the Musketeers. This officer perished at Fontenoy, leaving a
      child, to whom King Louis XVI. subsequently granted the privileges, by
      patent, of a farmer-general, in remembrance of his father&rsquo;s death on the
      field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This financier, a fashionable wit, great at charades, capping verses, and
      posies to Chlora, lived in society, was a hanger-on to the Duc de
      Nivernais, and fancied himself obliged to follow the nobility into exile;
      but he took care to carry his money with him. Thus the rich <i>emigre</i>
      was able to assist more than one family of high rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1800, tired of hoping, and perhaps tired of lending, he returned to
      Sancerre, bought back La Baudraye out of a feeling of vanity and imaginary
      pride, quite intelligible in a sheriff&rsquo;s grandson, though under the
      consulate his prospects were but slender; all the more so, indeed, because
      the ex-farmer-general had small hopes of his heir&rsquo;s perpetuating the new
      race of La Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Athanase Polydore Milaud de la Baudraye, his only son, more than
      delicate from his birth, was very evidently the child of a man whose
      constitution had early been exhausted by the excesses in which rich men
      indulge, who then marry at the first stage of premature old age, and thus
      bring degeneracy into the highest circles of society. During the years of
      the emigration Madame de la Baudraye, a girl of no fortune, chosen for her
      noble birth, had patiently reared this sallow, sickly boy, for whom she
      had the devoted love mothers feel for such changeling creatures. Her death&mdash;she
      was a Casteran de la Tour&mdash;contributed to bring about Monsieur de la
      Baudraye&rsquo;s return to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Lucullus of the Milauds, when he died, left his son the fief,
      stripped indeed of its fines and dues, but graced with weathercocks
      bearing his coat-of-arms, a thousand louis-d&rsquo;or&mdash;in 1802 a
      considerable sum of money&mdash;and certain receipts for claims on very
      distinguished <i>emigres</i> enclosed in a pocketbook full of verses, with
      this inscription on the wrapper, <i>Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young La Baudraye did not die, but he owed his life to habits of monastic
      strictness; to the economy of action which Fontenelle preached as the
      religion of the invalid; and, above all, to the air of Sancerre and the
      influence of its fine elevation, whence a panorama over the valley of the
      Loire may be seen extending for forty leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1802 to 1815 young La Baudraye added several plots to his vineyards,
      and devoted himself to the culture of the vine. The Restoration seemed to
      him at first so insecure that he dared not go to Paris to claim his debts;
      but after Napoleon&rsquo;s death he tried to turn his father&rsquo;s collection of
      autographs into money, though not understanding the deep philosophy which
      had thus mixed up I O U&rsquo;s and copies of verses. But the winegrower lost so
      much time in impressing his identity on the Duke of Navarreins &ldquo;and
      others,&rdquo; as he phrased it, that he came back to Sancerre, to his beloved
      vintage, without having obtained anything but offers of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Restoration had raised the nobility to such a degree of lustre as made
      La Baudraye wish to justify his ambitions by having an heir. This happy
      result of matrimony he considered doubtful, or he would not so long have
      postponed the step; however, finding himself still above ground in 1823,
      at the age of forty-three, a length of years which no doctor, astrologer,
      or midwife would have dared to promise him, he hoped to earn the reward of
      his sober life. And yet his choice showed such a lack of prudence in
      regard to his frail constitution, that the malicious wit of a country town
      could not help thinking it must be the result of some deep calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this time His Eminence, Monseigneur the Archbishop of Bourges, had
      converted to the Catholic faith a young person, the daughter of one of the
      citizen families, who were the first upholders of Calvinism, and who,
      thanks to their obscurity or to some compromise with Heaven, had escaped
      from the persecutions under Louis XIV. The Piedefers&mdash;a name that was
      obviously one of the quaint nicknames assumed by the champions of the
      Reformation&mdash;had set up as highly respectable cloth merchants. But in
      the reign of Louis XVI., Abraham Piedefer fell into difficulties, and at
      his death in 1786 left his two children in extreme poverty. One of them,
      Tobie Piedefer, went out to the Indies, leaving the pittance they had
      inherited to his elder brother. During the Revolution Moise Piedefer
      bought up the nationalized land, pulled down abbeys and churches with all
      the zeal of his ancestors, oddly enough, and married a Catholic, the only
      daughter of a member of the Convention who had perished on the scaffold.
      This ambitious Piedefer died in 1819, leaving a little girl of remarkable
      beauty. This child, brought up in the Calvinist faith, was named Dinah, in
      accordance with the custom in use among the sect, of taking their
      Christian names from the Bible, so as to have nothing in common with the
      Saints of the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Dinah Piedefer was placed by her mother in one of the best
      schools in Bourges, that kept by the Demoiselles Chamarolles, and was soon
      as highly distinguished for the qualities of her mind as for her beauty;
      but she found herself snubbed by girls of birth and fortune, destined
      by-and-by to play a greater part in the world than a mere plebeian, the
      daughter of a mother who was dependent on the settlement of Piedefer&rsquo;s
      estate. Dinah, having raised herself for the moment above her companions,
      now aimed at remaining on a level with them for the rest of her life. She
      determined, therefore, to renounce Calvinism, in the hope that the
      Cardinal would extend his favor to his proselyte and interest himself in
      her prospects. You may from this judge of Mademoiselle Dinah&rsquo;s
      superiority, since at the age of seventeen she was a convert solely from
      ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archbishop, possessed with the idea that Dinah Piedefer would adorn
      society, was anxious to see her married. But every family to whom the
      prelate made advances took fright at a damsel gifted with the looks of a
      princess, who was reputed to be the cleverest of Mademoiselle Chamarolles&rsquo; 
      pupils and who, at the somewhat theatrical ceremonial of prize-giving,
      always took a leading part. A thousand crowns a year, which was as much as
      she could hope for from the estate of La Hautoy when divided between the
      mother and daughter, would be a mere trifle in comparison with the
      expenses into which a husband would be led by the personal advantages of
      so brilliant a creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as all these facts came to the ears of little Polydore de la
      Baudraye&mdash;for they were the talk of every circle in the Department of
      the Cher&mdash;he went to Bourges just when Madame Piedefer, a devotee at
      high services, had almost made up her own mind and her daughter&rsquo;s to take
      the first comer with well-lined pockets&mdash;the first <i>chien coiffe</i>,
      as they say in Le Berry. And if the Cardinal was delighted to receive
      Monsieur de la Baudraye, Monsieur de la Baudraye was even better pleased
      to receive a wife from the hands of the Cardinal. The little gentleman
      only demanded of His Eminence a formal promise to support his claims with
      the President of the Council to enable him to recover his debts from the
      Duc de Navarreins &ldquo;and others&rdquo; by a lien on their indemnities. This
      method, however, seemed to the able Minister then occupying the Pavillon
      Marsan rather too sharp practice, and he gave the vine-owner to understand
      that his business should be attended to all in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to imagine the excitement produced in the Sancerre district by
      the news of Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s imprudent marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite intelligible,&rdquo; said President Boirouge; &ldquo;the little man was
      very much startled, as I am told, at hearing that handsome young Milaud,
      the Attorney-General&rsquo;s deputy at Nevers, say to Monsieur de Clagny as they
      were looking at the turrets of La Baudraye, &lsquo;That will be mine some day.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; 
      says Clagny, &lsquo;he may marry and have children.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;&mdash;So
      you may imagine how such a changeling as little La Baudraye must hate that
      colossal Milaud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was at Nevers a plebeian branch of the Milauds, which had grown so
      rich in the cutlery trade that the present representative of that branch
      had been brought up to the civil service, in which he had enjoyed the
      patronage of Marchangy, now dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be as well to eliminate from this story, in which moral
      developments play the principal part, the baser material interests which
      alone occupied Monsieur de la Baudraye, by briefly relating the results of
      his negotiations in Paris. This will also throw light on certain
      mysterious phenomena of contemporary history, and the underground
      difficulties in matters of politics which hampered the Ministry at the
      time of the Restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promises of Ministers were so illusory that Monsieur de la Baudraye
      determined on going to Paris at the time when the Cardinal&rsquo;s presence was
      required there by the sitting of the Chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how the Duc de Navarreins, the principal debtor threatened by
      Monsieur de la Baudraye, got out of the scrape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country gentleman, lodging at the Hotel de Mayence, Rue Saint-Honore,
      near the Place Vendome, one morning received a visit from a confidential
      agent of the Ministry, who was an expert in &ldquo;winding up&rdquo; business. This
      elegant personage, who stepped out of an elegant cab, and was dressed in
      the most elegant style, was requested to walk up to No. 3&mdash;that is to
      say, to the third floor, to a small room where he found his provincial
      concocting a cup of coffee over his bedroom fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to Monsieur Milaud de la Baudraye that I have the honor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the little man, draping himself in his dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      After examining this garment, the illicit offspring of an old chine
      wrapper of Madame Piedefer&rsquo;s and a gown of the late lamented Madame de la
      Baudraye, the emissary considered the man, the dressing-gown, and the
      little stove on which the milk was boiling in a tin saucepan, as so
      homogeneous and characteristic, that he deemed it needless to beat about
      the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lay a wager, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, audaciously, &ldquo;that you dine for
      forty sous at Hurbain&rsquo;s in the Palais Royal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you, having seen you there,&rdquo; replied the Parisian with perfect
      gravity. &ldquo;All the princes&rsquo; creditors dine there. You know that you recover
      scarcely ten per cent on debts from these fine gentlemen. I would not give
      you five per cent on a debt to be recovered from the estate of the late
      Duc d&rsquo;Orleans&mdash;nor even,&rdquo; he added in a low voice&mdash;&ldquo;from
      MONSIEUR.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come to buy up the bills?&rdquo; said La Baudraye, thinking himself
      very clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy them!&rdquo; said his visitor. &ldquo;Why, what do you take me for? I am Monsieur
      des Lupeaulx, Master of Appeals, Secretary-General to the Ministry, and I
      have come to propose an arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, monsieur, you know the position of your debtor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my debtors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur, you understand the position of your debtors; they stand
      high in the King&rsquo;s good graces, but they have no money, and are obliged to
      make a good show.&mdash;Again, you know the difficulties of the political
      situation. The aristocracy has to be rehabilitated in the face of a very
      strong force of the third estate. The King&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and France does
      him scant justice&mdash;is to create a peerage as a national institution
      analogous to the English peerage. To realize this grand idea we need years&mdash;and
      millions.&mdash;<i>Noblesse oblige</i>. The Duc de Navarreins, who is, as
      you know, first gentleman of the Bedchamber to the King, does not
      repudiate his debt; but he cannot&mdash;Now, be reasonable.&mdash;Consider
      the state of politics. We are emerging from the pit of the Revolution.&mdash;and
      you yourself are noble&mdash;He simply cannot pay&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hasty,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx. &ldquo;Listen. He cannot pay in money. Well,
      then; you, a clever man, can take payment in favors&mdash;Royal or
      Ministerial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! When in 1793 my father put down one hundred thousand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, recrimination is useless. Listen to a simple statement in
      political arithmetic: The collectorship at Sancerre is vacant; a certain
      paymaster-general of the forces has a claim on it, but he has no chance of
      getting it; you have the chance&mdash;and no claim. You will get the
      place. You will hold it for three months, you will then resign, and
      Monsieur Gravier will give twenty thousand francs for it. In addition, the
      Order of the Legion of Honor will be conferred on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is something,&rdquo; said the wine-grower, tempted by the money
      rather than by the red ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said des Lupeaulx, &ldquo;you must show your gratitude to His
      Excellency by restoring to Monseigneur the Duc de Navarreins all your
      claims on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Baudraye returned to Sancerre as Collector of Taxes. Six months later
      he was superseded by Monsieur Gravier, regarded as one of the most
      agreeable financiers who had served under the Empire, and who was of
      course presented by Monsieur de la Baudraye to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was released from his functions, Monsieur de la Baudraye
      returned to Paris to come to an understanding with some other debtors.
      This time he was made a Referendary under the Great Seal, Baron, and
      Officer of the Legion of Honor. He sold the appointment as Referendary;
      and then the Baron de la Baudraye called on his last remaining debtors,
      and reappeared at Sancerre as Master of Appeals, with an appointment as
      Royal Commissioner to a commercial association established in the
      Nivernais, at a salary of six thousand francs, an absolute sinecure. So
      the worthy La Baudraye, who was supposed to have committed a financial
      blunder, had, in fact, done very good business in the choice of a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to sordid economy and an indemnity paid him for the estate
      belonging to his father, nationalized and sold in 1793, by the year 1827
      the little man could realize the dream of his whole life. By paying four
      hundred thousand francs down, and binding himself to further instalments,
      which compelled him to live for six years on the air as it came, to use
      his own expression, he was able to purchase the estate of Anzy on the
      banks of the Loire, about two leagues above Sancerre, and its magnificent
      castle built by Philibert de l&rsquo;Orme, the admiration of every connoisseur,
      and for five centuries the property of the Uxelles family. At last he was
      one of the great landowners of the province! It is not absolutely certain
      that the satisfaction of knowing that an entail had been created, by
      letters patent dated back to December 1820, including the estates of Anzy,
      of La Baudraye, and of La Hautoy, was any compensation to Dinah on finding
      herself reduced to unconfessed penuriousness till 1835.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sketch of the financial policy of the first Baron de la Baudraye
      explains the man completely. Those who are familiar with the manias of
      country folks will recognize in him the <i>land-hunger</i> which becomes
      such a consuming passion to the exclusion of every other; a sort of
      avarice displayed in the sight of the sun, which often leads to ruin by a
      want of balance between the interest on mortgages and the products of the
      soil. Those who, from 1802 till 1827, had merely laughed at the little man
      as they saw him trotting to Saint-Thibault and attending to his business,
      like a merchant living on his vineyards, found the answer to the riddle
      when the ant-lion seized his prey, after waiting for the day when the
      extravagance of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse culminated in the sale of
      that splendid property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Piedefer came to live with her daughter. The combined fortunes of
      Monsieur de la Baudraye and his mother-in-law, who had been content to
      accept an annuity of twelve hundred francs on the lands of La Hautoy which
      she handed over to him, amounted to an acknowledged income of about
      fifteen thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early days of her married life, Dinah had effected some
      alterations which had made the house at La Baudraye a very pleasant
      residence. She turned a spacious forecourt into a formal garden, pulling
      down wine-stores, presses, and shabby outhouses. Behind the manor-house,
      which, though small, did not lack style with its turrets and gables, she
      laid out a second garden with shrubs, flower-beds, and lawns, and divided
      it from the vineyards by a wall hidden under creepers. She also made
      everything within doors as comfortable as their narrow circumstances
      allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order not to be ruined by a young lady so very superior as Dinah seemed
      to be, Monsieur de la Baudraye was shrewd enough to say nothing as to the
      recovery of debts in Paris. This dead secrecy as to his money matters gave
      a touch of mystery to his character, and lent him dignity in his wife&rsquo;s
      eyes during the first years of their married life&mdash;so majestic is
      silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      The alterations effected at La Baudraye made everybody eager to see the
      young mistress, all the more so because Dinah would never show herself,
      nor receive any company, before she felt quite settled in her home and had
      thoroughly studied the inhabitants, and, above all, her taciturn husband.
      When, one spring morning in 1825, pretty Madame de la Baudraye was first
      seen walking on the Mall in a blue velvet dress, with her mother in black
      velvet, there was quite an excitement in Sancerre. This dress confirmed
      the young woman&rsquo;s reputation for superiority, brought up, as she had been,
      in the capital of Le Berry. Every one was afraid lest in entertaining this
      phoenix of the Department, the conversation should not be clever enough;
      and, of course, everybody was constrained in the presence of Madame de la
      Baudraye, who produced a sort of terror among the woman-folk. As they
      admired a carpet of Indian shawl-pattern in the La Baudraye drawing-room,
      a Pompadour writing-table carved and gilt, brocade window curtains, and a
      Japanese bowl full of flowers on the round table among a selection of the
      newest books; when they heard the fair Dinah playing at sight, without
      making the smallest demur before seating herself at the piano, the idea
      they conceived of her superiority assumed vast proportions. That she might
      never allow herself to become careless or the victim of bad taste, Dinah
      had determined to keep herself up to the mark as to the fashions and
      latest developments of luxury by an active correspondence with Anna
      Grossetete, her bosom friend at Mademoiselle Chamarolles&rsquo; school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna, thanks to a fine fortune, had married the Comte de Fontaine&rsquo;s third
      son. Thus those ladies who visited at La Baudraye were perpetually piqued
      by Dinah&rsquo;s success in leading the fashion; do what they would, they were
      always behind, or, as they say on the turf, distanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all these trifles gave rise to malignant envy in the ladies of
      Sancerre, Dinah&rsquo;s conversation and wit engendered absolute aversion. In
      her ambition to keep her mind on the level of Parisian brilliancy, Madame
      de la Baudraye allowed no vacuous small talk in her presence, no
      old-fashioned compliments, no pointless remarks; she would never endure
      the yelping of tittle-tattle, the backstairs slander which forms the
      staple of talk in the country. She liked to hear of discoveries in science
      or art, or the latest pieces at the theatres, the newest poems, and by
      airing the cant words of the day she made a show of uttering thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Duret, Cure of Sancerre, an old man of a lost type of clergy in
      France, a man of the world with a liking for cards, had not dared to
      indulge this taste in so liberal a district as Sancerre; he, therefore,
      was delighted at Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s coming, and they got on together
      to admiration. The <i>sous-prefet</i>, one Vicomte de Chargeboeuf, was
      delighted to find in Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s drawing-room a sort of oasis
      where there was a truce to provincial life. As to Monsieur de Clagny, the
      Public Prosecutor, his admiration for the fair Dinah kept him bound to
      Sancerre. The enthusiastic lawyer refused all promotion, and became a
      quite pious adorer of this angel of grace and beauty. He was a tall, lean
      man, with a minatory countenance set off by terrible eyes in deep black
      circles, under enormous eyebrows; and his eloquence, very unlike his
      love-making, could be incisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Gravier was a little, round man, who in the days of the Empire
      had been a charming ballad-singer; it was this accomplishment that had won
      him the high position of Paymaster-General of the forces. Having mixed
      himself up in certain important matters in Spain with generals at that
      time in opposition, he had made the most of these connections to the
      Minister, who, in consideration of the place he had lost, promised him the
      Receivership at Sancerre, and then allowed him to pay for the appointment.
      The frivolous spirit and light tone of the Empire had become ponderous in
      Monsieur Gravier; he did not, or would not, understand the wide difference
      between manners under the Restoration and under the Empire. Still, he
      conceived of himself as far superior to Monsieur de Clagny; his style was
      in better taste; he followed the fashion, was to be seen in a buff
      waistcoat, gray trousers, and neat, tightly-fitting coats; he wore a
      fashionable silk tie slipped through a diamond ring, while the lawyer
      never dressed in anything but black&mdash;coat, trousers, and waistcoat
      alike, and those often shabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      These four men were the first to go into ecstasies over Dinah&rsquo;s
      cultivation, good taste, and refinement, and pronounced her a woman of
      most superior mind. Then the women said to each other, &ldquo;Madame de la
      Baudraye must laugh at us behind our back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This view, which was more or less correct, kept them from visiting at La
      Baudraye. Dinah, attainted and convicted of pedantry, because she spoke
      grammatically, was nicknamed the Sappho of Saint-Satur. At last everybody
      made insolent game of the great qualities of the woman who had thus roused
      the enmity of the ladies of Sancerre. And they ended by denying a
      superiority&mdash;after all, merely comparative!&mdash;which emphasized
      their ignorance, and did not forgive it. Where the whole population is
      hunch-backed, a straight shape is the monstrosity; Dinah was regarded as
      monstrous and dangerous, and she found herself in a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished at seeing the women of the neighborhood only at long intervals,
      and for visits of a few minutes, Dinah asked Monsieur de Clagny the reason
      of this state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too superior a woman to be liked by other women,&rdquo; said the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Gravier, when questioned by the forlorn fair, only, after much
      entreaty, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, lady fair, you are not satisfied to be merely charming. You are
      clever and well educated, you know every book that comes out, you love
      poetry, you are a musician, and you talk delightfully. Women cannot
      forgive so much superiority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Men said to Monsieur de la Baudraye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You who have such a Superior Woman for a wife are very fortunate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       And at last he himself would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I who have a Superior Woman for a wife, am very fortunate,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Piedefer, flattered through her daughter, also allowed herself to
      say such things&mdash;&ldquo;My daughter, who is a very Superior Woman, was
      writing yesterday to Madame de Fontaine such and such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who know the world&mdash;France, Paris&mdash;know how true it is
      that many celebrities are thus created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later, by the end of the year 1825, Dinah de la Baudraye was
      accused of not choosing to have any visitors but men; then it was said
      that she did not care for women&mdash;and that was a crime. Not a thing
      could she do, not her most trifling action, could escape criticism and
      misrepresentation. After making every sacrifice that a well-bred woman can
      make, and placing herself entirely in the right, Madame de la Baudraye was
      so rash as to say to a false friend who condoled with her on her
      isolation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather have my bowl empty than with anything in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech produced a terrible effect on Sancerre, and was cruelly
      retorted on the Sappho of Saint-Satur when, seeing her childless after
      five years of married life, <i>little</i> de la Baudraye became a byword
      for laughter. To understand this provincial witticism, readers may be
      reminded of the Bailli de Ferrette&mdash;some, no doubt, having known him&mdash;of
      whom it was said that he was the bravest man in Europe for daring to walk
      on his legs, and who was accused of putting lead in his shoes to save
      himself from being blown away. Monsieur de la Baudraye, a sallow and
      almost diaphanous creature, would have been engaged by the Bailli de
      Ferrette as first gentleman-in-waiting if that diplomatist had been the
      Grand Duke of Baden instead of being merely his envoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de la Baudraye, whose legs were so thin that, for mere decency,
      he wore false calves, whose thighs were like the arms of an average man,
      whose body was not unlike that of a cockchafer, would have been an
      advantageous foil to the Bailli de Ferrette. As he walked, the little
      vine-owner&rsquo;s leg-pads often twisted round on to his shins, so little did
      he make a secret of them, and he would thank any one who warned him of
      this little mishap. He wore knee-breeches, black silk stockings, and a
      white waistcoat till 1824. After his marriage he adopted blue trousers and
      boots with heels, which made Sancerre declare that he had added two inches
      to his stature that he might come up to his wife&rsquo;s chin. For ten years he
      was always seen in the same little bottle-green coat with large
      white-metal buttons, and a black stock that accentuated his cold stingy
      face, lighted up by gray-blue eyes as keen and passionless as a cat&rsquo;s.
      Being very gentle, as men are who act on a fixed plan of conduct, he
      seemed to make his wife happy by never contradicting her; he allowed her
      to do the talking, and was satisfied to move with the deliberate tenacity
      of an insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, adored for her beauty, in which she had no rival, and admired for
      her cleverness by the most gentlemanly men of the place, encouraged their
      admiration by conversations, for which it was subsequently asserted, she
      prepared herself beforehand. Finding herself listened to with rapture, she
      soon began to listen to herself, enjoyed haranguing her audience, and at
      last regarded her friends as the chorus in a tragedy, there only to give
      her her cues. In fact, she had a very fine collection of phrases and
      ideas, derived either from books or by assimilating the opinions of her
      companions, and thus became a sort of mechanical instrument, going off on
      a round of phrases as soon as some chance remark released the spring. To
      do her justice, Dinah was choke full of knowledge, and read everything,
      even medical books, statistics, science, and jurisprudence; for she did
      not know how to spend her days when she had reviewed her flower-beds and
      given her orders to the gardener. Gifted with an excellent memory, and the
      talent which some women have for hitting on the right word, she could talk
      on any subject with the lucidity of a studied style. And so men came from
      Cosne, from la Charite, and from Nevers, on the right bank; from Lere,
      Vailly, Argent, Blancafort, and Aubigny, on the left bank, to be
      introduced to Madame de la Baudraye, as they used in Switzerland, to be
      introduced to Madame de Stael. Those who only once heard the round of
      tunes emitted by this musical snuff-box went away amazed, and told such
      wonders of Dinah as made all the women jealous for ten leagues round.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an indescribable mental headiness in the admiration we inspire,
      or in the effect of playing a part, which fends off criticism from
      reaching the idol. An atmosphere, produced perhaps by unceasing nervous
      tension, forms a sort of halo, through which the world below is seen. How
      otherwise can we account for the perennial good faith which leads to so
      many repeated presentments of the same effects, and the constant ignoring
      of warnings given by children, such a terror to their parents, or by
      husbands, so familiar as they are with the peacock airs of their wives?
      Monsieur de la Baudraye had the frankness of a man who opens an umbrella
      at the first drop of rain. When his wife was started on the subject of
      Negro emancipation or the improvement of convict prisons, he would take up
      his little blue cap and vanish without a sound, in the certainty of being
      able to get to Saint-Thibault to see off a cargo of puncheons, and return
      an hour later to find the discussion approaching a close. Or, if he had no
      business to attend to, he would go for a walk on the Mall, whence he
      commanded the lovely panorama of the Loire valley, and take a draught of
      fresh air while his wife was performing a sonata in words, or a
      dialectical duet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once fairly established as a Superior Woman, Dinah was eager to prove her
      devotion to the most remarkable creations of art. She threw herself into
      the propaganda of the romantic school, including, under Art, poetry and
      painting, literature and sculpture, furniture and the opera. Thus she
      became a mediaevalist. She was also interested in any treasures that dated
      from the Renaissance, and employed her allies as so many devoted
      commission agents. Soon after she was married, she had become possessed of
      the Rougets&rsquo; furniture, sold at Issoudun early in 1824. She purchased some
      very good things at Nivernais and the Haute-Loire. At the New Year and on
      her birthday her friends never failed to give her some curiosities. These
      fancies found favor in the eyes of Monsieur de la Baudraye; they gave him
      an appearance of sacrificing a few crowns to his wife&rsquo;s taste. In point of
      fact, his land mania allowed him to think of nothing but the estate of
      Anzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These &ldquo;antiquities&rdquo; at that time cost much less than modern furniture. By
      the end of five or six years the ante-room, the dining-room, the two
      drawing-rooms, and the boudoir which Dinah had arranged on the ground
      floor of La Baudraye, every spot even to the staircase, were crammed with
      masterpieces collected in the four adjacent departments. These
      surroundings, which were called <i>queer</i> by the neighbors, were quite
      in harmony with Dinah. All these Marvels, so soon to be the rage, struck
      the imagination of the strangers introduced to her; they came expecting
      something unusual; and they found their expectations surpassed when,
      behind a bower of flowers, they saw these catacombs full of old things,
      piled up as Sommerard used to pile them&mdash;that &ldquo;Old Mortality&rdquo; of
      furniture. And then these finds served as so many springs which, turned on
      by a question, played off an essay on Jean Goujon, Michel Columb, Germain
      Pilon, Boulle, Van Huysum, and Boucher, the great native painter of Le
      Berry; on Clodion, the carver of wood, on Venetian mirrors, on Brustolone,
      an Italian tenor who was the Michael-Angelo of boxwood and holm oak; on
      the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
      centuries, on the glazes of Bernard de Palissy, the enamels of Petitot,
      the engravings of Albrecht Durer&mdash;whom she called Dur; on
      illuminations on vellum, on Gothic architecture, early decorated,
      flamboyant and pure&mdash;enough to turn an old man&rsquo;s brain and fire a
      young man with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye, possessed with the idea of waking up Sancerre,
      tried to form a so-called literary circle. The Presiding Judge, Monsieur
      Boirouge, who happened to have a house and garden on his hands, part of
      the Popinot-Chandier property, favored the notion of this <i>coterie</i>.
      The wily Judge talked over the rules of the society with Madame de la
      Baudraye; he proposed to figure as one of the founders, and to let the
      house for fifteen years to the literary club. By the time it had existed a
      year the members were playing dominoes, billiards, and bouillotte, and
      drinking mulled wine, punch, and liqueurs. A few elegant little suppers
      were then given, and some masked balls during the Carnival. As to
      literature&mdash;there were the newspapers. Politics and business were
      discussed. Monsieur de la Baudraye was constantly there&mdash;on his
      wife&rsquo;s account, as she said jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This result deeply grieved the Superior Woman, who despaired of Sancerre,
      and collected the wit of the neighborhood in her own drawing-room.
      Nevertheless, and in spite of the efforts of Messieurs de Chargeboeuf,
      Gravier, and de Clagny, of the Abbe Duret and the two chief magistrates,
      of a young doctor, and a young Assistant Judge&mdash;all blind admirers of
      Dinah&rsquo;s&mdash;there were occasions when, weary of discussion, they allowed
      themselves an excursion into the domain of agreeable frivolity which
      constitutes the common basis of worldly conversation. Monsieur Gravier
      called this &ldquo;from grave to gay.&rdquo; The Abbe Duret&rsquo;s rubber made another
      pleasing variety on the monologues of the oracle. The three rivals, tired
      of keeping their minds up to the level of the &ldquo;high range of discussion&rdquo;&mdash;as
      they called their conversation&mdash;but not daring to confess it, would
      sometimes turn with ingratiating hints to the old priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Cure is dying for his game,&rdquo; they would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wily priest lent himself very readily to the little trick. He
      protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should lose too much by ceasing to listen to our inspired hostess!&rdquo;
       and so he would incite Dinah&rsquo;s magnanimity to take pity at last on her
      dear Abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bold manoeuvre, a device of the Sous-prefet&rsquo;s, was repeated with so
      much skill that Dinah never suspected her slaves of escaping to the prison
      yard, so to speak, of the cardtable; and they would leave her one of the
      younger functionaries to harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      One young landowner, and the dandy of Sancerre, fell away from Dinah&rsquo;s
      good graces in consequence of some rash demonstrations. After soliciting
      the honor of admission to this little circle, where he flattered himself
      he could snatch the blossom from the constituted authorities who guarded
      it, he was so unfortunate as to yawn in the middle of an explanation Dinah
      was favoring him with&mdash;for the fourth time, it is true&mdash;of the
      philosophy of Kant. Monsieur de la Thaumassiere, the grandson of the
      historian of Le Berry, was thenceforth regarded as a man entirely bereft
      of soul and brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three devotees <i>en titre</i> each submitted to these exorbitant
      demands on their mind and attention, in hope of a crowning triumph, when
      at last Dinah should become human; for neither of them was so bold as to
      imagine that Dinah would give up her innocence as a wife till she should
      have lost all her illusions. In 1826, when she was surrounded by adorers,
      Dinah completed her twentieth year, and the Abbe Duret kept her in a sort
      of fervid Catholicism; so her worshipers had to be content to overwhelm
      her with little attentions and small services, only too happy to be taken
      for the carpet-knights of this sovereign lady, by strangers admitted to
      spend an evening or two at La Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye is a fruit that must be left to ripen.&rdquo; This was
      the opinion of Monsieur Gravier, who was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the lawyer, he wrote letters four pages long, to which Dinah replied
      in soothing speech as she walked, leaning on his arm, round and round the
      lawn after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye, thus guarded by three passions, and always under
      the eye of her pious mother, escaped the malignity of slander. It was so
      evident to all Sancerre that no two of these three men would ever leave
      the third alone with Madame de la Baudraye, that their jealousy was a
      comedy to the lookers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach Saint-Thibault from Caesar&rsquo;s Gate there is a way much shorter
      than that by the ramparts, down what is known in mountainous districts as
      a <i>coursiere</i>, called at Sancerre <i>le Casse-cou</i>, or Break-neck
      Alley. The name is significant as applied to a path down the steepest part
      of the hillside, thickly strewn with stones, and shut in by the high banks
      of the vineyards on each side. By way of the Break-neck the distance from
      Sancerre to La Baudraye is much abridged. The ladies of the place, jealous
      of the Sappho of Saint-Satur, were wont to walk on the Mall, looking down
      this Longchamp of the bigwigs, whom they would stop and engage in
      conversation&mdash;sometimes the Sous-prefet and sometimes the Public
      Prosecutor&mdash;and who would listen with every sign of impatience or
      uncivil absence of mind. As the turrets of La Baudraye are visible from
      the Mall, many a younger man came to contemplate the abode of Dinah while
      envying the ten or twelve privileged persons who might spend their
      afternoons with the Queen of the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de la Baudraye was not slow to discover the advantage he, as
      Dinah&rsquo;s husband, held over his wife&rsquo;s adorers, and he made use of them
      without any disguise, obtaining a remission of taxes, and gaining two
      lawsuits. In every litigation he used the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s name with
      such good effect that the matter was carried no further, and, like all
      undersized men, he was contentious and litigious in business, though in
      the gentlest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the more certainly guiltless she was, the less
      conceivable did Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s position seem to the prying eyes
      of these women. Frequently, at the house of the Presidente de Boirouge,
      the ladies of a certain age would spend a whole evening discussing the La
      Baudraye household, among themselves of course. They all had suspicions of
      a mystery, a secret such as always interests women who have had some
      experience of life. And, in fact, at La Baudraye one of those slow and
      monotonous conjugal tragedies was being played out which would have
      remained for ever unknown if the merciless scalpel of the nineteenth
      century, guided by the insistent demand for novelty, had not dissected the
      darkest corners of the heart, or at any rate those which the decency of
      past centuries left unopened. And that domestic drama sufficiently
      accounts for Dinah&rsquo;s immaculate virtue during her early married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young lady, whose triumphs at school had been the outcome of her pride,
      and whose first scheme in life had been rewarded by a victory, was not
      likely to pause in such a brilliant career. Frail as Monsieur de la
      Baudraye might seem, he was really an unhoped-for good match for
      Mademoiselle Dinah Piedefer. But what was the hidden motive of this
      country landowner when, at forty-four, he married a girl of seventeen; and
      what could his wife make out of the bargain? This was the text of Dinah&rsquo;s
      first meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man never behaved quite as his wife expected. To begin with, he
      allowed her to take the five precious acres now wasted in pleasure grounds
      round La Baudraye, and paid, almost with generosity, the seven or eight
      thousand francs required by Dinah for improvements in the house, enabling
      her to buy the furniture at the Rougets&rsquo; sale at Issoudun, and to
      redecorate her rooms in various styles&mdash;Mediaeval, Louis XIV., and
      Pompadour. The young wife found it difficult to believe that Monsieur de
      la Baudraye was so miserly as he was reputed, or else she must have great
      influence with him. The illusion lasted a year and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s second journey to Paris, Dinah discovered
      in him the Artic coldness of a provincial miser whenever money was in
      question. The first time she asked for supplies she played the sweetest of
      the comedies of which Eve invented the secret; but the little man put it
      plainly to his wife that he gave her two hundred francs a month for her
      personal expenses, and paid Madame Piedefer twelve hundred francs a year
      as a charge on the lands of La Hautoy, and that this was two hundred
      francs a year more than was agreed to under the marriage settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing of the cost of housekeeping,&rdquo; he said in conclusion. &ldquo;You
      may give your friends cake and tea in the evening, for you must have some
      amusement. But I, who spent but fifteen hundred francs a year as a
      bachelor, now spend six thousand, including rates and repairs, and this is
      rather too much in relation to the nature of our property. A winegrower is
      never sure of what his expenses may be&mdash;the making, the duty, the
      casks&mdash;while the returns depend on a scorching day or a sudden frost.
      Small owners, like us, whose income is far from being fixed, must base
      their estimates on their minimum, for they have no means of making up a
      deficit or a loss. What would become of us if a wine merchant became
      bankrupt? In my opinion, promissory notes are so many cabbage-leaves. To
      live as we are living, we ought always to have a year&rsquo;s income in hand and
      count on no more than two-thirds of our returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any form of resistance is enough to make a woman vow to subdue it; Dinah
      flung herself against a will of iron padded round with gentleness. She
      tried to fill the little man&rsquo;s soul with jealousy and alarms, but it was
      stockaded with insolent confidence. He left Dinah, when he went to Paris,
      with all the conviction of Medor in Angelique&rsquo;s fidelity. When she
      affected cold disdain, to nettle this changeling by the scorn a courtesan
      sometimes shows to her &ldquo;protector,&rdquo; and which acts on him with the
      certainty of the screw of a winepress, Monsieur de la Baudraye gazed at
      his wife with fixed eyes, like those of a cat which, in the midst of
      domestic broils, waits till a blow is threatened before stirring from its
      place. The strange, speechless uneasiness that was perceptible under his
      mute indifference almost terrified the young wife of twenty; she could not
      at first understand the selfish quiescence of this man, who might be
      compared to a cracked pot, and who, in order to live, regulated his
      existence with the unchangeable regularity which a clockmaker requires of
      a clock. So the little man always evaded his wife, while she always hit
      out, as it were, ten feet above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah&rsquo;s fits of fury when she saw herself condemned never to escape from
      La Baudraye and Sancerre are more easily imagined than described&mdash;she
      who had dreamed of handling a fortune and managing the dwarf whom she, the
      giant, had at first humored in order to command. In the hope of some day
      making her appearance on the greater stage of Paris, she accepted the
      vulgar incense of her attendant knights with a view to seeing Monsieur de
      la Baudraye&rsquo;s name drawn from the electoral urn; for she supposed him to
      be ambitious, after seeing him return thrice from Paris, each time a step
      higher on the social ladder. But when she struck on the man&rsquo;s heart, it
      was as though she had tapped on marble! The man who had been
      Receiver-General and Referendary, who was now Master of Appeals, Officer
      of the Legion of Honor, and Royal Commissioner, was but a mole throwing up
      its little hills round and round a vineyard! Then some lamentations were
      poured into the heart of the Public Prosecutor, of the Sous-prefet, even
      of Monsieur Gravier, and they all increased in their devotion to this
      sublime victim; for, like all women, she never mentioned her speculative
      schemes, and&mdash;again like all women&mdash;finding such speculation
      vain, she ceased to speculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, tossed by mental storms, was still undecided when, in the autumn of
      1827, the news was told of the purchase by the Baron de la Baudraye of the
      estate of Anzy. Then the little old man showed an impulsion of pride and
      glee which for a few months changed the current of his wife&rsquo;s ideas; she
      fancied there was a hidden vein of greatness in the man when she found him
      applying for a patent of entail. In his triumph the Baron exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinah, you shall be a countess yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was then a patched-up reunion between the husband and wife, such as
      can never endure, and which only humiliated and fatigued a woman whose
      apparent superiority was unreal, while her unseen superiority was genuine.
      This whimsical medley is commoner than people think. Dinah, who was
      ridiculous from the perversity of her cleverness, had really great
      qualities of soul, but circumstances did not bring these rarer powers to
      light, while a provincial life debased the small change of her wit from
      day to day. Monsieur de la Baudraye, on the contrary, devoid of soul, of
      strength, and of wit, was fated to figure as a man of character, simply by
      pursuing a plan of conduct which he was too feeble to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in their lives a first phase, lasting six years, during which
      Dinah, alas! became utterly provincial. In Paris there are several kinds
      of women: the duchess and the financier&rsquo;s wife, the ambassadress and the
      consul&rsquo;s wife, the wife of the minister who is a minister, and of him who
      is no longer a minister; then there is the lady&mdash;quite the lady&mdash;of
      the right bank of the Seine and of the left. But in the country there is
      but one kind of woman, and she, poor thing, is the provincial woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark points to one of the sores of modern society. It must be
      clearly understood: France in the nineteenth century is divided into two
      broad zones&mdash;Paris, and the provinces. The provinces jealous of
      Paris; Paris never thinking of the provinces but to demand money. Of old,
      Paris was the Capital of the provinces, and the court ruled the Capital;
      now, all Paris is the Court, and all the country is the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      However lofty, beautiful, and clever a girl born in any department of
      France may be on entering life, if, like Dinah Piedefer, she marries in
      the country and remains there, she inevitably becomes the provincial
      woman. In spite of every determination, the commonplace of second-rate
      ideas, indifference to dress, the culture of vulgar people, swamp the
      sublimer essence hidden in the youthful plant; all is over, it falls into
      decay. How should it be otherwise? From their earliest years girls bred in
      the country see none but provincials; they cannot imagine anything
      superior, their choice lies among mediocrities; provincial fathers marry
      their daughters to provincial sons; crossing the races is never thought
      of, and the brain inevitably degenerates, so that in many country towns
      intellect is as rare as the breed is hideous. Mankind becomes dwarfed in
      mind and body, for the fatal principle of conformity of fortune governs
      every matrimonial alliance. Men of talent, artists, superior brains&mdash;every
      bird of brilliant plumage flies to Paris. The provincial woman, inferior
      in herself, is also inferior through her husband. How is she to live happy
      under this crushing twofold consciousness?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a third and terrible element besides her congenital and
      conjugal inferiority which contributes to make the figure arid and gloomy;
      to reduce it, narrow it, distort it fatally. Is not one of the most
      flattering unctions a woman can lay to her soul the assurance of being
      something in the existence of a superior man, chosen by herself,
      wittingly, as if to have some revenge on marriage, wherein her tastes were
      so little consulted? But if in the country the husbands are inferior
      beings, the bachelors are no less so. When a provincial wife commits her
      &ldquo;little sin,&rdquo; she falls in love with some so-called handsome native, some
      indigenous dandy, a youth who wears gloves and is supposed to ride well;
      but she knows at the bottom of her soul that her fancy is in pursuit of
      the commonplace, more or less well dressed. Dinah was preserved from this
      danger by the idea impressed upon her of her own superiority. Even if she
      had not been as carefully guarded in her early married life as she was by
      her mother, whose presence never weighed upon her till the day when she
      wanted to be rid of it, her pride, and her high sense of her own
      destinies, would have protected her. Flattered as she was to find herself
      surrounded by admirers, she saw no lover among them. No man here realized
      the poetical ideal which she and Anna Grossetete had been wont to sketch.
      When, stirred by the involuntary temptations suggested by the homage she
      received, she asked herself, &ldquo;If I had to make a choice, who should it
      be?&rdquo; she owned to a preference for Monsieur de Chargeboeuf, a gentleman of
      good family, whose appearance and manners she liked, but whose cold
      nature, selfishness, and narrow ambition, never rising above a prefecture
      and a good marriage, repelled her. At a word from his family, who were
      alarmed lest he should be killed for an intrigue, the Vicomte had already
      deserted a woman he had loved in the town where he previously had been
      Sous-prefet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny, on the other hand, the only man whose mind appealed to
      hers, whose ambition was founded on love, and who knew what love means,
      Dinah thought perfectly odious. When Dinah saw herself condemned to six
      years&rsquo; residence at Sancerre she was on the point of accepting the
      devotion of Monsieur le Vicomte de Chargeboeuf; but he was appointed to a
      prefecture and left the district. To Monsieur de Clagny&rsquo;s great
      satisfaction, the new Sous-prefet was a married man whose wife made
      friends with Dinah. The lawyer had now no rival to fear but Monsieur
      Gravier. Now Monsieur Gravier was the typical man of forty of whom women
      make use while they laugh at him, whose hopes they intentionally and
      remorselessly encourage, as we are kind to a beast of burden. In six
      years, among all the men who were introduced to her from twenty leagues
      round, there was not one in whose presence Dinah was conscious of the
      excitement caused by personal beauty, by a belief in promised happiness,
      by the impact of a superior soul, or the anticipation of a love affair,
      even an unhappy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus none of Dinah&rsquo;s choicest faculties had a chance of developing; she
      swallowed many insults to her pride, which was constantly suffering under
      the husband who so calmly walked the stage as supernumerary in the drama
      of her life. Compelled to bury her wealth of love, she showed only the
      surface to the world. Now and then she would try to rouse herself, try to
      form some manly resolution; but she was kept in leading strings by the
      need for money. And so, slowly and in spite of the ambitious protests and
      grievous recriminations of her own mind, she underwent the provincial
      metamorphosis here described. Each day took with it a fragment of her
      spirited determination. She had laid down a rule for the care of her
      person, which she gradually departed from. Though at first she kept up
      with the fashions and the little novelties of elegant life, she was
      obliged to limit her purchases by the amount of her allowance. Instead of
      six hats, caps, or gowns, she resigned herself to one gown each season.
      She was so much admired in a certain bonnet that she made it do duty for
      two seasons. So it was in everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unfrequently her artistic sense led her to sacrifice the requirements
      of her person to secure some bit of Gothic furniture. By the seventh year
      she had come so low as to think it convenient to have her morning dresses
      made at home by the best needlewoman in the neighborhood; and her mother,
      her husband, and her friends pronounced her charming in these inexpensive
      costumes which did credit to her taste. Her ideas were imitated! As she
      had no standard of comparison, Dinah fell into the snares that surround
      the provincial woman. If a Parisian woman&rsquo;s hips are too narrow or too
      full, her inventive wit and the desire to please help to find some heroic
      remedy; if she has some defect, some ugly spot, or small disfigurement,
      she is capable of making it an adornment; this is often seen; but the
      provincial woman&mdash;never! If her waist is too short and her figure ill
      balanced, well, she makes up her mind to the worst, and her adorers&mdash;or
      they do not adore her&mdash;must take her as she is, while the Parisian
      always insists on being taken for what she is not. Hence the preposterous
      bustles, the audacious flatness, the ridiculous fulness, the hideous
      outlines ingeniously displayed, to which a whole town will become
      accustomed, but which are so astounding when a provincial woman makes her
      appearance in Paris or among Parisians. Dinah, who was extremely slim,
      showed it off to excess, and never knew a dull moment when it became
      ridiculous; when, reduced by the dull weariness of her life, she looked
      like a skeleton in clothes; and her friends, seeing her every day, did not
      observe the gradual change in her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the natural results of a provincial life. In spite of
      marriage, a young woman preserves her beauty for some time, and the town
      is proud of her; but everybody sees her every day, and when people meet
      every day their perception is dulled. If, like Madame de la Baudraye, she
      loses her color, it is scarcely noticed; or, again, if she flushes a
      little, that is intelligible and interesting. A little neglect is thought
      charming, and her face is so carefully studied, so well known, that slight
      changes are scarcely noticed, and regarded at last as &ldquo;beauty spots.&rdquo; When
      Dinah ceased to have a new dress with a new season, she seemed to have
      made a concession to the philosophy of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with matters of speech, choice of words and ideas, as it is
      with matters of feeling. The mind can rust as well as the body if it is
      not rubbed up in Paris; but the thing on which provincialism most sets its
      stamp is gesture, gait, and movement; these soon lose the briskness which
      Paris constantly keeps alive. The provincial is used to walk and move in a
      world devoid of accident or change, there is nothing to be avoided; so in
      Paris she walks on as raw recruits do, never remembering that there may be
      hindrances, for there are none in her way in her native place, where she
      is known, where she is always in her place, and every one makes way for
      her. Thus she loses all the charm of the unforeseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And have you ever noticed the effect on human beings of a life in common?
      By the ineffaceable instinct of simian mimicry they all tend to copy each
      other. Each one, without knowing it, acquires the gestures, the tone of
      voice, the manner, the attitudes, the very countenance of others. In six
      years Dinah had sunk to the pitch of the society she lived in. As she
      acquired Monsieur de Clagny&rsquo;s ideas she assumed his tone of voice; she
      unconsciously fell into masculine manners from seeing none but men; she
      fancied that by laughing at what was ridiculous in them she was safe from
      catching it; but, as often happens, some hue of what she laughed at
      remained in the grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Parisian woman sees so many examples of good taste that a contrary
      result ensues. In Paris women learn to seize the hour and moment when they
      may appear to advantage; while Madame de la Baudraye, accustomed to take
      the stage, acquired an indefinable theatrical and domineering manner, the
      air of a <i>prima donna</i> coming forward on the boards, of which
      ironical smiles would soon have cured her in the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after she had acquired this stock of absurdities, and, deceived by her
      worshipers, imagined them to be added graces, a moment of terrible
      awakening came upon her like the fall of an avalanche from a mountain. In
      one day she was crushed by a frightful comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1829, after the departure of Monsieur de Chargeboeuf, she was excited
      by the anticipation of a little pleasure; she was expecting the Baronne de
      Fontaine. Anna&rsquo;s husband, who was now Director-General under the Minister
      of Finance, took advantage of leave of absence on the occasion of his
      father&rsquo;s death to take his wife to Italy. Anna wished to spend the day at
      Sancerre with her school-friend. This meeting was strangely disastrous.
      Anna, who at school had been far less handsome than Dinah, now, as Baronne
      de Fontaine, was a thousand times handsomer than the Baronne de la
      Baudraye, in spite of her fatigue and her traveling dress. Anna stepped
      out of an elegant traveling chaise loaded with Paris milliners&rsquo; boxes, and
      she had with her a lady&rsquo;s maid, whose airs quite frightened Dinah. All the
      difference between a woman of Paris and a provincial was at once evident
      to Dinah&rsquo;s intelligent eye; she saw herself as her friend saw her&mdash;and
      Anna found her altered beyond recognition. Anna spent six thousand francs
      a year on herself alone, as much as kept the whole household at La
      Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty-four hours the friends had exchanged many confidences; and the
      Parisian, seeing herself so far superior to the phoenix of Mademoiselle
      Chamarolles&rsquo; school, showed her provincial friend such kindness, such
      attentions, while giving her certain explanations, as were so many stabs
      to Dinah, though she perfectly understood that Anna&rsquo;s advantages all lay
      on the surface, while her own were for ever buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anna had left, Madame de la Baudraye, by this time two-and-twenty,
      fell into the depths of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that ails you?&rdquo; asked Monsieur de Clagny, seeing her so
      dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;has learned to live, while I have been learning to
      endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tragi-comedy was, in fact, being enacted in Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s
      house, in harmony with her struggles over money matters and her successive
      transformations&mdash;a drama to which no one but Monsieur de Clagny and
      the Abbe Duret ever knew the clue, when Dinah in sheer idleness, or
      perhaps sheer vanity, revealed the secret of her anonymous fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though a mixture of verse and prose is a monstrous anomaly in French
      literature, there must be exceptions to the rule. This tale will be one of
      the two instances in these Studies of violation of the laws of narrative;
      for to give a just idea of the unconfessed struggle which may excuse,
      though it cannot absolve Dinah, it is necessary to give an analysis of a
      poem which was the outcome of her deep despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her patience and her resignation alike broken by the departure of the
      Vicomte de Chargeboeuf, Dinah took the worthy Abbe&rsquo;s advice to exhale her
      evil thoughts in verse&mdash;a proceeding which perhaps accounts for some
      poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find such relief as those who write epitaphs or elegies over
      those whom they have lost. Pain is soothed in the heart as lines surge up
      in the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This strange production caused a great ferment in the departments of the
      Allier, the Nievre, and the Cher, proud to possess a poet capable of
      rivalry with the glories of Paris. <i>Paquita la Sevillane</i>, by <i>Jan
      Diaz</i>, was published in the <i>Echo du Morvan</i>, a review which for
      eighteen months maintained its existence in spite of provincial
      indifference. Some knowing persons at Nevers declared that Jan Diaz was
      making fun of the new school, just then bringing out its eccentric verse,
      full of vitality and imagery, and of brilliant effects produced by defying
      the Muse under pretext of adapting German, English, and Romanesque
      mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem began with this ballad:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Ah! if you knew the fragrant plain,
  The air, the sky, of golden Spain,
  Its fervid noons, its balmy spring,
  Sad daughters of the northern gloom,
  Of love, of heav&rsquo;n, of native home,
  You never would presume to sing!

  For men are there of other mould
  Than those who live in this dull cold.
  And there to music low and sweet
  Sevillian maids, from eve till dawn,
  Dance lightly on the moonlit lawn
  In satin shoes, on dainty feet.

  Ah, you would be the first to blush
  Over your dancers&rsquo; romp and rush,
  And your too hideous carnival,
  That turns your cheeks all chill and blue,
  And skips the mud in hob-nail&rsquo;d shoe&mdash;
  A truly dismal festival.

  To pale-faced girls, and in a squalid room,
  Paquita sang; the murky town beneath
  Was Rouen whence the slender spires rise
    To chew the storm with teeth.
  Rouen so hideous, noisy, full of rage&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      And here followed a magnificent description of Rouen&mdash;where Dinah had
      never been&mdash;written with the affected brutality which, a little
      later, inspired so many imitations of Juvenal; a contrast drawn between
      the life of a manufacturing town and the careless life of Spain, between
      the love of Heaven and of human beauty, and the worship of machinery, in
      short, between poetry and sordid money-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jan Diaz accounted for Paquita&rsquo;s horror of Normandy by saying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Seville, you see, had been her native home,
    Seville, where skies are blue and evening sweet.
  She, at thirteen, the sovereign of the town,
    Had lovers at her feet.

  For her three Toreadors had gone to death
  Or victory, the prize to be a kiss&mdash;
  One kiss from those red lips of sweetest breath&mdash;
    A longed-for touch of bliss!
</pre>
    <p>
      The features of the Spanish girl&rsquo;s portrait have served so often as those
      of the courtesan in so many self-styled <i>poems</i>, that it would be
      tiresome to quote here the hundred lines of description. To judge of the
      lengths to which audacity had carried Dinah, it will be enough to give the
      conclusion. According to Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s ardent pen, Paquita was
      so entirely created for love that she can hardly have met with a knight
      worthy of her; for
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  .... In her passionate fire
    Every man would have swooned from the heat,
  When she at love&rsquo;s feast, in her fervid desire,
    As yet had but taken her seat.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet she could quit the joys of Seville, its woods and fields of
      orange-trees, for a Norman soldier who won her love and carried her away
      to his hearth and home. She did not weep for her Andalusia, the Soldier
      was her whole joy.... But the day came when he was compelled to start for
      Russia in the footsteps of the great Emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more dainty than the description of the parting between
      the Spanish girl and the Normandy Captain of Artillery, who, in the
      delirium of passion expressed with feeling worthy of Byron, exacted from
      Paquita a vow of absolute fidelity, in the Cathedral at Rouen in front of
      the alter of the Blessed Virgin, who
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Though a Maid is a woman, and never forgives
    When lovers are false to their vows.
</pre>
    <p>
      A large part of the poem was devoted to describing Paquita&rsquo;s sufferings
      when alone in Rouen waiting till the campaign was over; she stood writhing
      at the window bars as she watched happy couples go by; she suppressed her
      passion in her heart with a determination that consumed her; she lived on
      narcotics, and exhausted herself in dreams.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Almost she died, but still her heart was true;
  And when at last her soldier came again,
  He found her beauty ever fresh and new&mdash;
    He had not loved in vain!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he, pale and frozen by the cold of Russia, chilled to the very
      marrow, met his yearning fair one with a melancholy smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole poem was written up to this situation, which was worked out with
      such vigor and boldness as too entirely justified the Abbe Duret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paquita, on reaching the limits set to real love, did not, like Julie and
      Heloise, throw herself into the ideal; no, she rushed into the paths of
      vice, which is, no doubt, shockingly natural; but she did it without any
      touch of magnificence, for lack of means, as it would be difficult to find
      in Rouen men impassioned enough to place Paquita in a suitable setting of
      luxury and splendor. This horrible realism, emphasized by gloomy poetic
      feeling, had inspired some passages such as modern poetry is too free
      with, rather too like the flayed anatomical figures known to artists as <i>ecorches</i>.
      Then, by a highly philosophical revulsion, after describing the house of
      ill-fame where the Andalusian ended her days, the writer came back to the
      ballad at the opening:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Paquita now is faded, shrunk, and old,
    But she it was who sang:

  &ldquo;If you but knew the fragrant plain,
  The air, the sky, of golden Spain,&rdquo; etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      The gloomy vigor of this poem, running to about six hundred lines, and
      serving as a powerful foil, to use a painter&rsquo;s word, to the two <i>seguidillas</i>
      at the beginning and end, the masculine utterance of inexpressible grief,
      alarmed the woman who found herself admired by three departments, under
      the black cloak of the anonymous. While she fully enjoyed the intoxicating
      delights of success, Dinah dreaded the malignity of provincial society,
      where more than one woman, if the secret should slip out, would certainly
      find points of resemblance between the writer and Paquita. Reflection came
      too late; Dinah shuddered with shame at having made &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of some of her
      woes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write no more,&rdquo; said the Abbe Duret. &ldquo;You will cease to be a woman; you
      will be a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moulins, Nevers, Bourges were searched to find Jan Diaz; but Dinah was
      impenetrable. To remove any evil impression, in case any unforeseen chance
      should betray her name, she wrote a charming poem in two cantos on <i>The
      Mass-Oak</i>, a legend of the Nivernais:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time the folks of Nevers and the folks of Saint-Saulge, at
      war with each other, came at daybreak to fight a battle, in which one or
      other should perish, and met in the forest of Faye. And then there stood
      between them, under an oak, a priest whose aspect in the morning sun was
      so commanding that the foes at his bidding heard Mass as he performed it
      under the oak, and at the words of the Gospel they made friends.&rdquo;&mdash;The
      oak is still shown in the forest of Faye.
    </p>
    <p>
      This poem, immeasurably superior to <i>Paquita la Sevillane</i>, was far
      less admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these two attempts Madame de la Baudraye, feeling herself a poet,
      had a light on her brow and a flash in her eyes that made her handsomer
      than ever. She cast longing looks at Paris, aspiring to fame&mdash;and
      fell back into her den of La Baudraye, her daily squabbles with her
      husband, and her little circle, where everybody&rsquo;s character, intentions,
      and remarks were too well known not to have become a bore. Though she
      found relief from her dreary life in literary work, and poetry echoed
      loudly in her empty life, though she thus found an outlet for her
      energies, literature increased her hatred of the gray and ponderous
      provincial atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after the Revolution of 1830, the glory of George Sand was reflected
      on Le Berry, many a town envied La Chatre the privilege of having given
      birth to this rival of Madame de Stael and Camille Maupin, and were ready
      to do homage to minor feminine talent. Thus there arose in France a vast
      number of tenth Muses, young girls or young wives tempted from a silent
      life by the bait of glory. Very strange doctrines were proclaimed as to
      the part women should play in society. Though the sound common sense which
      lies at the root of the French nature was not perverted, women were
      suffered to express ideas and profess opinions which they would not have
      owned to a few years previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny took advantage of this outbreak of freedom to collect
      the works of Jan Diaz in a small volume printed by Desroziers at Moulins.
      He wrote a little notice of the author, too early snatched from the world
      of letters, which was amusing to those who were in the secret, but which
      even then had not the merit of novelty. Such practical jokes, capital so
      long as the author remains unknown, fall rather flat if subsequently the
      poet stands confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point of view, however, the memoir of Jan Diaz, born at Bourges
      in 1807, the son of a Spanish prisoner, may very likely some day deceive
      the compiler of some <i>Universal Biography</i>. Nothing is overlooked;
      neither the names of the professors at the Bourges College, nor those of
      his deceased schoolfellows, such as Lousteau, Bianchon, and other famous
      natives of the province, who, it is said, knew the dreamy, melancholy boy,
      and his precocious bent towards poetry. An elegy called <i>Tristesse</i>
      (Melancholy), written at school; the two poems <i>Paquita la Sevillane</i>
      and <i>Le Chene de la Messe</i>; three sonnets, a description of the
      Cathedral and the House of Jacques Coeur at Bourges, with a tale called <i>Carola</i>,
      published as the work he was engaged on at the time of his death,
      constituted the whole of these literary remains; and the poet&rsquo;s last
      hours, full of misery and despair, could not fail to wring the hearts of
      the feeling public of the Nievre, the Bourbonnais, the Cher, and the
      Morvan, where he died near Chateau-Chinon, unknown to all, even to the
      woman he had loved!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this little yellow paper volume two hundred copies were printed; one
      hundred and fifty were sold&mdash;about fifty in each department. This
      average of tender and poetic souls in three departments of France is
      enough to revive the enthusiasm of writers as to the <i>Furia Francese</i>,
      which nowadays is more apt to expend itself in business than in books.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Monsieur de Clagny had given away a certain number of copies, Dinah
      still had seven or eight, wrapped up in the newspapers which had published
      notices of the work. Twenty copies forwarded to the Paris papers were
      swamped in the editors&rsquo; offices. Nathan was taken in as well as several of
      his fellow-countrymen of Le Berry, and wrote an article on the great man,
      in which he credited him with all the fine qualities we discover in those
      who are dead and buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, warned by his fellow-schoolfellows, who could not remember Jan
      Diaz, waited for information from Sancerre, and learned that Jan Diaz was
      a pseudonym assumed by a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in and around Sancerre, Madame de la Baudraye became the rage; she
      was the future rival of George Sand. From Sancerre to Bourges a poem was
      praised which, at any other time, would certainly have been hooted. The
      provincial public&mdash;like every French public, perhaps&mdash;does not
      share the love of the King of the French for the happy medium: it lifts
      you to the skies or drags you in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the good Abbe, Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s counselor, was dead;
      he would certainly have prevented her rushing into public life. But three
      years of work without recognition weighed on Dinah&rsquo;s soul, and she
      accepted the clatter of fame as a substitute for her disappointed
      ambitions. Poetry and dreams of celebrity, which had lulled her grief
      since her meeting with Anna Grossetete, no longer sufficed to exhaust the
      activity of her morbid heart. The Abbe Duret, who had talked of the world
      when the voice of religion was impotent, who understood Dinah, and
      promised her a happy future by assuring her that God would compensate her
      for her sufferings bravely endured,&mdash;this good old man could no
      longer stand between the opening to sin and the handsome young woman he
      had called his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise old priest had more than once endeavored to enlighten Dinah as to
      her husband&rsquo;s character, telling her that the man could hate; but women
      are not ready to believe in such force in weak natures, and hatred is too
      constantly in action not to be a vital force. Dinah, finding her husband
      incapable of love, denied him the power to hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not confound hatred and vengeance,&rdquo; said the Abbe. &ldquo;They are two
      different sentiments. One is the instinct of small minds; the other is the
      outcome of law which great souls obey. God is avenged, but He does not
      hate. Hatred is a vice of narrow souls; they feed it with all their
      meanness, and make it a pretext for sordid tyranny. So beware of offending
      Monsieur de la Baudraye; he would forgive an infidelity, because he could
      make capital of it, but he would be doubly implacable if you should touch
      him on the spot so cruelly wounded by Monsieur Milaud of Nevers, and would
      make your life unendurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, at the time when the whole countryside&mdash;Nevers and Sancerre, Le
      Morvan and Le Berry&mdash;was priding itself on Madame de la Baudraye, and
      lauding her under the name of Jan Diaz, &ldquo;little La Baudraye&rdquo; felt her
      glory a mortal blow. He alone knew the secret source of <i>Paquita la
      Sevillane</i>. When this terrible work was spoken of, everybody said of
      Dinah&mdash;&ldquo;Poor woman! Poor soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women rejoiced in being able to pity her who had so long oppressed
      them; never had Dinah seemed to stand higher in the eyes of the
      neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shriveled old man, more wrinkled, yellower, feebler than ever, gave no
      sign; but Dinah sometimes detected in his eyes, as he looked at her, a
      sort of icy venom which gave the lie to his increased politeness and
      gentleness. She understood at last that this was not, as she had supposed,
      a mere domestic squabble; but when she forced an explanation with her
      &ldquo;insect,&rdquo; as Monsieur Gravier called him, she found the cold, hard
      impassibility of steel. She flew into a passion; she reproached him for
      her life these eleven years past; she made&mdash;intentionally&mdash;what
      women call a scene. But &ldquo;little La Baudraye&rdquo; sat in an armchair with his
      eyes shut, and listened phlegmatically to the storm. And, as usual, the
      dwarf got the better of his wife. Dinah saw that she had done wrong in
      writing; she vowed never to write another line, and she kept her vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was there desolation in the Sancerrois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did not Madame de la Baudraye compose any more verses?&rdquo; was the
      universal cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Madame de la Baudraye had no enemies; every one rushed to see
      her, not a week passed without fresh introductions. The wife of the
      presiding judge, an august <i>bourgeoise</i>, <i>nee</i> Popinot-Chandier,
      desired her son, a youth of two-and-twenty, to pay his humble respects to
      La Baudraye, and flattered herself that she might see her Gatien in the
      good graces of this Superior Woman.&mdash;The words Superior Woman had
      superseded the absurd nickname of <i>The Sappho of Saint-Satur</i>.&mdash;This
      lady, who for nine years had led the opposition, was so delighted at the
      good reception accorded to her son, that she became loud in her praises of
      the Muse of Sancerre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she exclaimed, in reply to a tirade from Madame de Clagny,
      who hated her husband&rsquo;s supposed mistress, &ldquo;she is the handsomest and
      cleverest woman in the whole province!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After scrambling through so many brambles and setting off on so many
      different roads, after dreaming of love in splendor and scenting the
      darkest dramas, thinking such terrible joys would be cheaply purchased so
      weary was she of her dreary existence, one day Dinah fell into the pit she
      had sworn to avoid. Seeing Monsieur de Clagny always sacrificing himself,
      and at last refusing a high appointment in Paris, where his family wanted
      to see him, she said to herself, &ldquo;He loves me!&rdquo; She vanquished her
      repulsion, and seemed willing to reward so much constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this impulse of generosity on her part that a coalition was due,
      formed in Sancerre to secure the return of Monsieur de Clagny at the next
      elections. Madame de la Baudraye had dreamed of going to Paris in the wake
      of the new deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of the most solemn promises, the hundred and fifty votes to
      be recorded in favor of this adorer of the lovely Dinah&mdash;who hoped to
      see this defender of the widow and the orphan wearing the gown of the
      Keeper of the Seals&mdash;figured as an imposing minority of fifty votes.
      The jealousy of the President de Boirouge, and Monsieur Gravier&rsquo;s hatred,
      for he believed in the candidate&rsquo;s supremacy in Dinah&rsquo;s heart, had been
      worked upon by a young Sous-prefet; and for this worthy deed the allies
      got the young man made a prefet elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never cease to regret,&rdquo; said he, as he quitted Sancerre, &ldquo;that I
      did not succeed in pleasing Madame de la Baudraye; that would have made my
      triumph complete!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The household that was thus racked by domestic troubles was calm on the
      surface; here were two ill-assorted but resigned beings, and the
      indescribable propriety, the lie that society insists on, and which to
      Dinah was an unendurable yoke. Why did she long to throw off the mask she
      had worn for twelve years? Whence this weariness which, every day,
      increased her hope of finding herself a widow?
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader who has noted all the phases of her existence will have
      understood the various illusions by which Dinah, like many another woman,
      had been deceived. After an attempt to master Monsieur de la Baudraye, she
      had indulged the hope of becoming a mother. Between those miserable
      disputes over household matters and the melancholy conviction as to her
      fate, quite a long time had elapsed. Then, when she had looked for
      consolation, the consoler, Monsieur de Chargeboeuf had left her. Thus, the
      overwhelming temptation which commonly causes women to sin had hitherto
      been absent. For if there are, after all, some women who make straight for
      unfaithfulness, are there not many more who cling to hope, and do not fall
      till they have wandered long in a labyrinth of secret woes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Dinah. She had so little impulse to fail in her duty, that she
      did not care enough for Monsieur de Clagny to forgive him his defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the move to the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy, the rearrangement of her collected
      treasures and curiosities, which derived added value from the splendid
      setting which Philibert de Lorme seemed to have planned on purpose for
      this museum, occupied her for several months, giving her leisure to
      meditate one of those decisive steps that startle the public, ignorant of
      the motives which, however, it sometimes discovers by dint of gossip and
      suppositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye had been greatly struck by the reputation of
      Lousteau, who was regarded as a lady&rsquo;s man of the first water in
      consequence of his intimacies among actresses; she was anxious to know
      him; she read his books, and was fired with enthusiasm, less perhaps for
      his talents than for his successes with women; and to attract him to the
      country, she started the notion that it was obligatory on Sancerre to
      return one of its great men at the elections. She made Gatien Boirouge
      write to the great physician Bianchon, whom he claimed as a cousin through
      the Popinots. Then she persuaded an old friend of the departed Madame
      Lousteau to stir up the journalist&rsquo;s ambitions by letting him know that
      certain persons in Sancerre were firmly bent on electing a deputy from
      among the distinguished men in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of her commonplace neighbors, Madame de la Baudraye would thus at
      last meet really illustrious men, and might give her fall the lustre of
      fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Lousteau nor Bianchon replied; they were waiting perhaps till the
      holidays. Bianchon, who had won his professor&rsquo;s chair the year before
      after a brilliant contest, could not leave his lectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of September, when the vintage was at its height, the two
      Parisians arrived in their native province, and found it absorbed in the
      unremitting toil of the wine-crop of 1836; there could therefore be no
      public demonstration in their favor. &ldquo;We have fallen flat,&rdquo; said Lousteau
      to his companion, in the slang of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1836, Lousteau, worn by sixteen years of struggle in the Capital, and
      aged quite as much by pleasure as by penury, hard work, and
      disappointments, looked eight-and-forty, though he was no more than
      thirty-seven. He was already bald, and had assumed a Byronic air in
      harmony with his early decay and the lines furrowed in his face by
      over-indulgence in champagne. He ascribed these signs-manual of
      dissipation to the severities of a literary life, declaring that the Press
      was murderous; and he gave it to be understood that it consumed superior
      talents, so as to lend a grace to his exhaustion. In his native town he
      thought proper to exaggerate his affected contempt of life and his
      spurious misanthropy. Still, his eyes could flash with fire like a volcano
      supposed to be extinct, and he endeavored, by dressing fashionably, to
      make up for the lack of youth that might strike a woman&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Bianchon, who wore the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, was fat and
      burly, as beseems a fashionable physician, with a patriarchal air, his
      hair thick and long, a prominent brow, the frame of a hard worker, and the
      calm expression of a philosopher. This somewhat prosaic personality set
      off his more frivolous companion to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two great men remained unrecognized during a whole morning at the inn
      where they had put up, and it was only by chance that Monsieur de Clagny
      heard of their arrival. Madame de la Baudraye, in despair at this,
      despatched Gatien Boirouge, who had no vineyards, to beg the two gentlemen
      to spend a few days at the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy. For the last year Dinah had
      played the chatelaine, and spent the winter only at La Baudraye. Monsieur
      Gravier, the Public Prosecutor, the Presiding Judge, and Gatien Boirouge
      combined to give a banquet to the great men, to meet the literary
      personages of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing that the beautiful Madame de la Baudraye was Jan Diaz, the
      Parisians went to spend three days at Anzy, fetched in a sort of wagonette
      driven by Gatien himself. The young man, under a genuine illusion, spoke
      of Madame de la Baudraye not only as the handsomest woman in those parts,
      a woman so superior that she might give George Sand a qualm, but as a
      woman who would produce a great sensation in Paris. Hence the extreme
      though suppressed astonishment of Doctor Bianchon and the waggish
      journalist when they beheld, on the garden steps of Anzy, a lady dressed
      in thin black cashmere with a deep tucker, in effect like a riding-habit
      cut short, for they quite understood the pretentiousness of such extreme
      simplicity. Dinah also wore a black velvet cap, like that in the portrait
      of Raphael, and below it her hair fell in thick curls. This attire showed
      off a rather pretty figure, fine eyes, and handsome eyelids somewhat faded
      by the weariful life that has been described. In Le Berry the singularity
      of this <i>artistic</i> costume was a cloak for the romantic affectations
      of the Superior Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the affectations of their too amiable hostess&mdash;which were,
      indeed, affectations of soul and mind&mdash;the friends glanced at each
      other, and put on a deeply serious expression to listen to Madame de la
      Baudraye, who made them a set speech of thanks for coming to cheer the
      monotony of her days. Dinah walked her guests round and round the lawn,
      ornamented with large vases of flowers, which lay in front of the Chateau
      d&rsquo;Anzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; said Lousteau, the practical joker, &ldquo;that so handsome a woman
      as you, and apparently so superior, should have remained buried in the
      country? What do you do to make life endurable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is the crux,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;It is unendurable. Utter despair
      or dull resignation&mdash;there is no third alternative; that is the arid
      soil in which our existence is rooted, and on which a thousand stagnant
      ideas fall; they cannot fertilize the ground, but they supply food for the
      etiolated flowers of our desert souls. Never believe in indifference!
      Indifference is either despair or resignation. Then each woman takes up
      the pursuit which, according to her character, seems to promise some
      amusement. Some rush into jam-making and washing, household management,
      the rural joys of the vintage or the harvest, bottling fruit, embroidering
      handkerchiefs, the cares of motherhood, the intrigues of a country town.
      Others torment a much-enduring piano, which, at the end of seven years,
      sounds like an old kettle, and ends its asthmatic life at the Chateau
      d&rsquo;Anzy. Some pious dames talk over the different brands of the Word of God&mdash;the
      Abbe Fritaud as compared with the Abbe Guinard. They play cards in the
      evening, dance with the same partners for twelve years running, in the
      same rooms, at the same dates. This delightful life is varied by solemn
      walks on the Mall, visits of politeness among the women, who ask each
      other where they bought their gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conversation is bounded on the south by remarks on the intrigues lying
      hidden under the stagnant water of provincial life, on the north by
      proposed marriages, on the west by jealousies, and on the east by sour
      remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she went on, striking an attitude, &ldquo;you see a woman wrinkled at
      nine-and-twenty, ten years before the time fixed by the rules of Doctor
      Bianchon, a woman whose skin is ruined at an early age, who turns as
      yellow as a quince when she is yellow at all&mdash;we have seen some turn
      green. When we have reached that point, we try to justify our normal
      condition; then we turn and rend the terrible passion of Paris with teeth
      as sharp as rat&rsquo;s teeth. We have Puritan women here, sour enough to tear
      the laces of Parisian finery, and eat out all the poetry of your Parisian
      beauties, who undermine the happiness of others while they cry up their
      walnuts and rancid bacon, glorify this squalid mouse-hole, and the dingy
      color and conventual small of our delightful life at Sancerre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire such courage, madame,&rdquo; said Bianchon. &ldquo;When we have to endure
      such misfortunes, it is well to have the wit to make a virtue of
      necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed at the brilliant move by which Dinah thus placed provincial life at
      the mercy of her guests, in anticipation of their sarcasms, Gatien
      Boirouge nudged Lousteau&rsquo;s elbow, with a glance and a smile, which said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! did I say too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;you are proving that we are still in Paris.
      I shall steal this gem of description; it will be worth ten thousand
      francs to me in an article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;never trust provincial women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye was wily enough&mdash;an innocent form of cunning,
      to be sure&mdash;to show the two Parisians, one of whom she would choose
      to be her conquerer, the snare into which he would fall, reflecting that
      she would have the upper hand at the moment when he should cease to see
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you first come,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you laugh at us. Then when you have
      forgotten the impression of Paris brilliancy, and see us in our own
      sphere, you pay court to us, if only as a pastime. And you, who are famous
      for your past passions, will be the object of attentions which will
      flatter you. Then take care!&rdquo; cried Dinah, with a coquettish gesture,
      raising herself above provincial absurdities and Lousteau&rsquo;s irony by her
      own sarcastic speech. &ldquo;When a poor little country-bred woman has an
      eccentric passion for some superior man, some Parisian who has wandered
      into the provinces, it is to her something more than a sentiment; she
      makes it her occupation and part of all her life. There is nothing more
      dangerous than the attachment of such a woman; she compares, she studies,
      she reflects, she dreams; and she will not give up her dream, she thinks
      still of the man she loves when he has ceased to think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now one of the catastrophes that weigh most heavily on a woman in the
      provinces is that abrupt termination of her passion which is so often seen
      in England. In the country, a life under minute observation as keen as an
      Indian&rsquo;s compels a woman either to keep on the rails or to start aside
      like a steam engine wrecked by an obstacle. The strategies of love, the
      coquetting which form half the composition of a Parisian woman, are
      utterly unknown here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;There is in a country-bred woman&rsquo;s heart a
      store of surprises, as in some toys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Dinah went on, &ldquo;a woman will have spoken to you three times in
      the course of a winter, and without your knowing it, you will be lodged in
      her heart. Then comes a picnic, an excursion, what not, and all is said&mdash;or,
      if you prefer it, all is done! This conduct, which seems odd to
      unobserving persons, is really very natural. A poet, such as you are, or a
      philosopher, an observer, like Doctor Bianchon, instead of vilifying the
      provincial woman and believing her depraved, would be able to guess the
      wonderful unrevealed poetry, every chapter, in short, of the sweet romance
      of which the last phrase falls to the benefit of some happy sub-lieutenant
      or some provincial bigwig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The provincial women I have met in Paris,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;were, in fact,
      rapid in their proceedings&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, they are strange,&rdquo; said the lady, giving a significant shrug of
      her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are like the playgoers who book for the second performance, feeling
      sure that the piece will not fail,&rdquo; replied the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the cause of all these woes?&rdquo; asked Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris is the monster that brings us grief,&rdquo; replied the Superior Woman.
      &ldquo;The evil is seven leagues round, and devastates the whole land.
      Provincial life is not self-existent. It is only when a nation is divided
      into fifty minor states that each can have a physiognomy of its own, and
      then a woman reflects the glory of the sphere where she reigns. This
      social phenomenon, I am told, may be seen in Italy, Switzerland, and
      Germany; but in France, as in every country where there is but one
      capital, a dead level of manners must necessarily result from
      centralization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would say that manners could only recover their individuality
      and native distinction by the formation of a federation of French states
      into one empire?&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hardly to be wished, for France would have to conquer too many
      countries,&rdquo; said Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This misfortune is unknown in England,&rdquo; exclaimed Dinah. &ldquo;London does not
      exert such tyranny as that by which Paris oppresses France&mdash;for
      which, indeed, French ingenuity will at last find a remedy; however, it
      has a worse disease in its vile hypocrisy, which is a far greater evil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English aristocracy,&rdquo; said Lousteau, hastening to put a word in, for
      he foresaw a Byronic paragraph, &ldquo;has the advantage over ours of
      assimilating every form of superiority; it lives in the midst of
      magnificent parks; it is in London for no more than two months. It lives
      in the country, flourishing there, and making it flourish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye, &ldquo;London is the capital of trade and
      speculation and the centre of government. The aristocracy hold a &lsquo;mote&rsquo; 
      there for sixty days only; it gives and takes the passwords of the day,
      looks in on the legislative cookery, reviews the girls to marry, the
      carriages to be sold, exchanges greetings, and is away again; and is so
      far from amusing, that it cannot bear itself for more than the few days
      known as &lsquo;the season.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; said Lousteau, hoping to stop this nimble tongue by an epigram,
      &ldquo;in Perfidious Albion, as the <i>Constitutionnel</i> has it, you may
      happen to meet a charming woman in any part of the kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But charming <i>English</i> women!&rdquo; replied Madame de la Baudraye with a
      smile. &ldquo;Here is my mother, I will introduce you,&rdquo; said she, seeing Madame
      Piedefer coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having introduced the two Paris lions to the ambitious skeleton that
      called itself woman under the name of Madame Piedefer&mdash;a tall, lean
      personage, with a red face, teeth that were doubtfully genuine, and hair
      that was undoubtedly dyed, Dinah left her visitors to themselves for a few
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gatien to Lousteau, &ldquo;what do you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that the clever woman of Sancerre is simply the greatest
      chatterbox,&rdquo; replied the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman who wants to see you deputy!&rdquo; cried Gatien. &ldquo;An angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, I forgot you were in love with her,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;Forgive
      the cynicism of an old scamp.&mdash;Ask Bianchon; I have no illusions
      left. I see things as they are. The woman has evidently dried up her
      mother like a partridge left to roast at too fierce a fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gatien de Boirouge contrived to let Madame de la Baudraye know what the
      journalist had said of her in the course of the dinner, which was copious,
      not to say splendid, and the lady took care not to talk too much while it
      was proceeding. This lack of conversation betrayed Gatien&rsquo;s indiscretion.
      Etienne tried to regain his footing, but all Dinah&rsquo;s advances were
      directed to Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, half-way through the evening, the Baroness was gracious to
      Lousteau again. Have you never observed what great meanness may be
      committed for small ends? Thus the haughty Dinah, who would not sacrifice
      herself for a fool, who in the depths of the country led such a wretched
      life of struggles, of suppressed rebellion, of unuttered poetry, who to
      get away from Lousteau had climbed the highest and steepest peak of her
      scorn, and who would not have come down if she had seen the sham Byron at
      her feet, suddenly stepped off it as she recollected her album.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye had caught the mania for autographs; she possessed
      an oblong volume which deserved the name of album better than most, as
      two-thirds of the pages were still blank. The Baronne de Fontaine, who had
      kept it for three months, had with great difficulty obtained a line from
      Rossini, six bars written by Meyerbeer, the four lines that Victor Hugo
      writes in every album, a verse from Lamartine, a few words from Beranger,
      <i>Calypso ne pouvait se consoler du depart d&rsquo;Ulysse</i> (the first words
      of <i>Telemaque</i>) written by George Sand, Scribe&rsquo;s famous lines on the
      Umbrella, a sentence from Charles Nodier, an outline of distance by Jules
      Dupre, the signature of David d&rsquo;Angers, and three notes written by Hector
      Berlioz. Monsieur de Clagny, during a visit to Paris, added a song by
      Lacenaire&mdash;a much coveted autograph, two lines from Fieschi, and an
      extremely short note from Napoleon, which were pasted on to pages of the
      album. Then Monsieur Gravier, in the course of a tour, had persuaded
      Mademoiselle Mars to write her name on this album, with Mademoiselles
      Georges, Taglioni, and Grisi, and some distinguished actors, such as
      Frederick Lemaitre, Monrose, Bouffe, Rubini, Lablache, Nourrit, and Arnal;
      for he knew a set of old fellows brought up in the seraglio, as they
      phrased it, who did him this favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This beginning of a collection was all the more precious to Dinah because
      she was the only person for ten leagues round who owned an album. Within
      the last two years, however, several young ladies had acquired such books,
      in which they made their friends and acquaintances write more or less
      absurd quotations or sentiments. You who spend your lives in collecting
      autographs, simple and happy souls, like Dutch tulip fanciers, you will
      excuse Dinah when, in her fear of not keeping her guests more than two
      days, she begged Bianchon to enrich the volume she handed to him with a
      few lines of his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made Lousteau smile by showing him this sentence on the first
      page:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What makes the populace dangerous is that it has in its pocket an
  absolution for every crime.

   &ldquo;J. B. DE CLAGNY.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will second the man who is brave enough to plead in favor of the
      Monarchy,&rdquo; Desplein&rsquo;s great pupil whispered to Lousteau, and he wrote
      below:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The distinction between Napoleon and a water-carrier is evident
  only to Society; Nature takes no account of it. Thus Democracy,
  which resists inequality, constantly appeals to Nature.

      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Dinah, amazed, &ldquo;you rich men take a gold piece out of your
      purse as poor men bring out a farthing.... I do not know,&rdquo; she went on,
      turning to Lousteau, &ldquo;whether it is taking an unfair advantage of a guest
      to hope for a few lines&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madame, you flatter me. Bianchon is a great man, but I am too
      insignificant!&mdash;Twenty years hence my name will be more difficult to
      identify than that of the Public Prosecutor whose axiom, written in your
      album, will designate him as an obscurer Montesquieu. And I should want at
      least twenty-four hours to improvise some sufficiently bitter reflections,
      for I could only describe what I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you needed a fortnight,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye graciously, as
      she handed him the book. &ldquo;I should keep you here all the longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five next morning all the party in the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy were astir,
      little La Baudraye having arranged a day&rsquo;s sport for the Parisians&mdash;less
      for their pleasure than to gratify his own conceit. He was delighted to
      make them walk over the twelve hundred acres of waste land that he was
      intending to reclaim, an undertaking that would cost some hundred thousand
      francs, but which might yield an increase of thirty to sixty thousand
      francs a year in the returns of the estate of Anzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why the Public Prosecutor has not come out with us?&rdquo; asked
      Gatien Boirouge of Monsieur Gravier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he told us that he was obliged to sit to-day; the minor cases are
      before the Court,&rdquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you believe that?&rdquo; cried Gatien. &ldquo;Well, my papa said to me,
      &lsquo;Monsieur Lebas will not join you early, for Monsieur de Clagny has begged
      him as his deputy to sit for him!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Gravier, changing countenance. &ldquo;And Monsieur de la Baudraye
      is gone to La Charite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you meddle in such matters?&rdquo; said Bianchon to Gatien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace is right,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;I cannot imagine why you trouble your
      heads so much about each other; you waste your time in frivolities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace Bianchon looked at Etienne Lousteau, as much as to say that
      newspaper epigrams and the satire of the &ldquo;funny column&rdquo; were
      incomprehensible at Sancerre.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching a copse, Monsieur Gravier left the two great men and Gatien,
      under the guidance of a keeper, to make their way through a little ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must wait for Monsieur Gravier,&rdquo; said Bianchon, when they had
      reached a clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be a great physician,&rdquo; said Gatien, &ldquo;but you are ignorant of
      provincial life. You mean to wait for Monsieur Gravier?&mdash;By this time
      he is running like a hare, in spite of his little round stomach; he is
      within twenty minutes of Anzy by now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Gatien looked at his
      watch. &ldquo;Good! he will be just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the chateau for breakfast,&rdquo; replied Gatien. &ldquo;Do you suppose I could
      rest easy if Madame de la Baudraye were alone with Monsieur de Clagny?
      There are two of them now; they will keep an eye on each other. Dinah will
      be well guarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! Then Madame de la Baudraye has not yet made up her mind?&rdquo; said
      Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So mamma thinks. For my part, I am afraid that Monsieur de Clagny has at
      last succeeded in bewitching Madame de la Baudraye. If he has been able to
      show her that he had any chance of putting on the robes of the Keeper of
      the Seals, he may have hidden his moleskin complexion, his terrible eyes,
      his touzled mane, his voice like a hoarse crier&rsquo;s, his bony figure, like
      that of a starveling poet, and have assumed all the charms of Adonis. If
      Dinah sees Monsieur de Clagny as Attorney-General, she may see him as a
      handsome youth. Eloquence has great privileges.&mdash;Besides, Madame de
      la Baudraye is full of ambition. She does not like Sancerre, and dreams of
      the glories of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what interest have you in all this?&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;If she is in
      love with the Public Prosecutor!&mdash;Ah! you think she will not love him
      for long, and you hope to succeed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You who live in Paris,&rdquo; said Gatien, &ldquo;meet as many different women as
      there are days in the year. But at Sancerre, where there are not half a
      dozen, and where, of those six, five set up for the most extravagant
      virtue, when the handsomest of them all keeps you at an infinite distance
      by looks as scornful as though she were of the blood royal, a young man of
      two-and-twenty may surely be allowed to make a guess at her secrets, since
      she must then treat him with some consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consideration! So that is what you call it in these parts?&rdquo; said the
      journalist with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should suppose Madame de la Baudraye to have too much good taste to
      trouble her head about that ugly ape,&rdquo; said Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;look here, O learned interpreter of human
      nature, let us lay a trap for the Public Prosecutor; we shall be doing our
      friend Gatien a service, and get a laugh out of it. I do not love Public
      Prosecutors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a keen intuition of destiny,&rdquo; said Horace. &ldquo;But what can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after dinner we will tell sundry little anecdotes of wives caught
      out by their husbands, killed, murdered under the most terrible
      circumstances.&mdash;Then we shall see the faces that Madame de la
      Baudraye and de Clagny will make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not amiss!&rdquo; said Bianchon; &ldquo;one or the other must surely, by look or
      gesture&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a newspaper editor,&rdquo; Lousteau went on, addressing Gatien, &ldquo;who,
      anxious to forefend a grievous fate, will take no stories but such as tell
      the tale of lovers burned, hewn, pounded, or cut to pieces; of wives
      boiled, fried, or baked; he takes them to his wife to read, hoping that
      sheer fear will keep her faithful&mdash;satisfied with that humble
      alternative, poor man! &lsquo;You see, my dear, to what the smallest error may
      lead you!&rsquo; says he, epitomizing Arnolfe&rsquo;s address to Agnes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye is quite guiltless; this youth sees double,&rdquo; said
      Bianchon. &ldquo;Madame Piedefer seems to me far too pious to invite her
      daughter&rsquo;s lover to the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy. Madame de la Baudraye would have
      to hoodwink her mother, her husband, her maid, and her mother&rsquo;s maid; that
      is too much to do. I acquit her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well with more reason because her husband never &lsquo;quits her,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
      Gatien, laughing at his own wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can easily remember two or three stories that will make Dinah quake,&rdquo;
       said Lousteau. &ldquo;Young man&mdash;and you too, Bianchon&mdash;let me beg you
      to maintain a stern demeanor; be thorough diplomatists, an easy manner
      without exaggeration, and watch the faces of the two criminals, you know,
      without seeming to do so&mdash;out of the corner of your eye, or in a
      glass, on the sly. This morning we will hunt the hare, this evening we
      will hunt the Public Prosecutor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening began with a triumph for Lousteau, who returned the album to
      the lady with this elegy written in it:
    </p>
    <h3>
      SPLEEN
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  You ask for verse from me, the feeble prey
  Of this self-seeking world, a waif and stray
    With none to whom to cling;
  From me&mdash;unhappy, purblind, hopeless devil!
  Who e&rsquo;en in what is good see only evil
    In any earthly thing!

  This page, the pastime of a dame so fair,
  May not reflect the shadow of my care,
    For all things have their place.
  Of love, to ladies bright, the poet sings,
  Of joy, and balls, and dress, and dainty things&mdash;
    Nay, or of God and Grace.

  It were a bitter jest to bid the pen
  Of one so worn with life, so hating men,
    Depict a scene of joy.
  Would you exult in sight to one born blind,
  Or&mdash;cruel! of a mother&rsquo;s love remind
    Some hapless orphan boy?

  When cold despair has gripped a heart still fond,
  When there is no young heart that will respond
    To it in love, the future is a lie.
  If there is none to weep when he is sad,
  And share his woe, a man were better dead!&mdash;
    And so I soon must die.

  Give me your pity! often I blaspheme
  The sacred name of God. Does it not seem
    That I was born in vain?
  Why should I bless him? Or why thank Him, since
  He might have made me handsome, rich, a prince&mdash;
    And I am poor and plain?
</pre>
    <p>
      ETIENNE LOUSTEAU. September 1836, Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have written those verses since yesterday?&rdquo; cried Clagny in a
      suspicious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, yes, as I was following the game; it is only too evident! I
      would gladly have done something better for madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The verses are exquisite!&rdquo; cried Dinah, casting up her eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, alas! the expression of a too genuine feeling,&rdquo; replied
      Lousteau, in a tone of deep dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will, of course, have guessed that the journalist had stored
      these lines in his memory for ten years at least, for he had written them
      at the time of the Restoration in disgust at being unable to get on.
      Madame de la Baudraye gazed at him with such pity as the woes of genius
      inspire; and Monsieur de Clagny, who caught her expression, turned in
      hatred against this sham <i>Jeune Malade</i> (the name of an Elegy written
      by Millevoye). He sat down to backgammon with the cure of Sancerre. The
      Presiding Judge&rsquo;s son was so extremely obliging as to place a lamp near
      the two players in such a way as that the light fell full on Madame de la
      Baudraye, who took up her work; she was embroidering in coarse wool a
      wicker-plait paper-basket. The three conspirators sat close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom are you decorating that pretty basket, madame?&rdquo; said Lousteau.
      &ldquo;For some charity lottery, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think there is too much display in charity done to the
      sound of a trumpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very indiscreet,&rdquo; said Monsieur Gravier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can there be any indiscretion,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;in inquiring who the
      happy mortal may be in whose room that basket is to stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no happy mortal in the case,&rdquo; said Dinah; &ldquo;it is for Monsieur de
      la Baudraye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Public Prosecutor looked slily at Madame de la Baudraye and her work,
      as if he had said to himself, &ldquo;I have lost my paper-basket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, madame, may we not think him happy in having a lovely wife, happy in
      her decorating his paper-baskets so charmingly? The colors are red and
      black, like Robin Goodfellow. If ever I marry, I only hope that twelve
      years after, my wife&rsquo;s embroidered baskets may still be for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should they not be for you?&rdquo; said the lady, fixing her fine gray
      eyes, full of invitation, on Etienne&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parisians believe in nothing,&rdquo; said the lawyer bitterly. &ldquo;The virtue of
      women is doubted above all things with terrible insolence. Yes, for some
      time past the books you have written, you Paris authors, your farces, your
      dramas, all your atrocious literature, turn on adultery&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Monsieur the Public Prosecutor,&rdquo; retorted Etienne, laughing,
      &ldquo;I left you to play your game in peace, I did not attack you, and here you
      are bringing an indictment against me. On my honor as a journalist, I have
      launched above a hundred articles against the writers you speak of; but I
      confess that in attacking them it was to attempt something like criticism.
      Be just; if you condemn them, you must condemn Homer, whose <i>Iliad</i>
      turns on Helen of Troy; you must condemn Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
      Eve and her serpent seem to me a pretty little case of symbolical
      adultery; you must suppress the Psalms of David, inspired by the highly
      adulterous love affairs of that Louis XIV. of Judah; you must make a
      bonfire of <i>Mithridate, le Tartuffe, l&rsquo;Ecole des Femmes, Phedre,
      Andromaque, le Mariage de Figaro</i>, Dante&rsquo;s <i>Inferno</i>, Petrarch&rsquo;s
      Sonnets, all the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the romances of the
      Middle Ages, the History of France, and of Rome, etc., etc. Excepting
      Bossuet&rsquo;s <i>Histoire des Variations</i> and Pascal&rsquo;s <i>Provinciales</i>,
      I do not think there are many books left to read if you insist on
      eliminating all those in which illicit love is mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much loss that would be!&rdquo; said Monsieur de Clagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne, nettled by the superior air assumed by Monsieur de Clagny, wanted
      to infuriate him by one of those cold-drawn jests which consist in
      defending an opinion in which we have no belief, simply to rouse the wrath
      of a poor man who argues in good faith; a regular journalist&rsquo;s pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we take up the political attitude into which you would force
      yourself,&rdquo; he went on, without heeding the lawyer&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;and assume
      the part of Public Prosecutor of all the ages&mdash;for every Government
      has its public ministry&mdash;well, the Catholic religion is infected at
      its fountain-head by a startling instance of illegal union. In the opinion
      of King Herod, and of Pilate as representing the Roman Empire, Joseph&rsquo;s
      wife figured as an adulteress, since, by her avowal, Joseph was not the
      father of Jesus. The heathen judge could no more recognize the Immaculate
      Conception than you yourself would admit the possibility of such a miracle
      if a new religion should nowadays be preached as based on a similar
      mystery. Do you suppose that a judge and jury in a police court would give
      credence to the operation of the Holy Ghost! And yet who can venture to
      assert that God will never again redeem mankind? Is it any better now than
      it was under Tiberius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your argument is blasphemy,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Clagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it,&rdquo; said the journalist, &ldquo;but not with malicious intent. You
      cannot suppress historical fact. In my opinion, Pilate, when he sentenced
      Jesus, and Anytus&mdash;who spoke for the aristocratic party at Athens&mdash;when
      he insisted on the death of Socrates, both represented established social
      interests which held themselves legitimate, invested with co-operative
      powers, and obliged to defend themselves. Pilate and Anytus in their time
      were not less logical than the public prosecutors who demanded the heads
      of the sergeants of La Rochelle; who, at this day, are guillotining the
      republicans who take up arms against the throne as established by the
      revolution of July, and the innovators who aim at upsetting society for
      their own advantage under pretence of organizing it on a better footing.
      In the eyes of the great families of Greece and Rome, Socrates and Jesus
      were criminals; to those ancient aristocracies their opinions were akin to
      those of the Mountain; and if their followers had been victorious, they
      would have produced a little &lsquo;ninety-three&rsquo; in the Roman Empire or in
      Attica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to come to, monsieur?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To adultery!&mdash;For thus, monsieur, a Buddhist as he smokes his pipe
      may very well assert that the Christian religion is founded in adultery;
      as we believe that Mahomet is an impostor; that his Koran is an epitome of
      the Old Testament and the Gospels; and that God never had the least
      intention of constituting that camel-driver His Prophet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were many men like you in France&mdash;and there are more than
      enough, unfortunately&mdash;all government would be impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there would be no religion at all,&rdquo; said Madame Piedefer, who had
      been making strangely wry faces all through this discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are paining them very much,&rdquo; said Bianchon to Lousteau in an
      undertone. &ldquo;Do not talk of religion; you are saying things that are enough
      to upset them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a writer or a romancer,&rdquo; said Monsieur Gravier, &ldquo;I should take
      the side of the luckless husbands. I, who have seen many things, and
      strange things too, know that among the ranks of deceived husbands there
      are some whose attitude is not devoid of energy, men who, at a crisis, can
      be very dramatic, to use one of your words, monsieur,&rdquo; he said, addressing
      Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very right, my dear Monsieur Gravier,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;I never
      thought that deceived husbands were ridiculous; on the contrary, I think
      highly of them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think a husband&rsquo;s confidence a sublime thing?&rdquo; said Bianchon.
      &ldquo;He believes in his wife, he does not suspect her, he trusts her
      implicitly. But if he is so weak as to trust her, you make game of him; if
      he is jealous and suspicious, you hate him; what, then, I ask you, is the
      happy medium for a man of spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Monsieur de Clagny had not just expressed such vehement disapproval of
      the immorality of stories in which the matrimonial compact is violated, I
      could tell you of a husband&rsquo;s revenge,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny threw the dice with a convulsive jerk, and dared not
      look up at the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story, from you!&rdquo; cried Madame de la Baudraye. &ldquo;I should hardly have
      dared to hope for such a treat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my story, madame; I am not clever enough to invent such a
      tragedy. It was told me&mdash;and how delightfully!&mdash;by one of our
      greatest writers, the finest literary musician of our day, Charles
      Nodier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell it,&rdquo; said Dinah. &ldquo;I never met Monsieur Nodier, so you have no
      comparison to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long after the 18th Brumaire,&rdquo; Etienne began, &ldquo;there was, as you
      know, a call to arms in Brittany and la Vendee. The First Consul, anxious
      before all things for peace in France, opened negotiations with the rebel
      chiefs, and took energetic military measures; but, while combining his
      plans of campaign with the insinuating charm of Italian diplomacy, he also
      set the Machiavelian springs of the police in movement, Fouche then being
      at its head. And none of these means were superfluous to stifle the fire
      of war then blaring in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this time a young man of the Maille family was despatched by the
      Chouans from Brittany to Saumur, to open communications between certain
      magnates of that town and its environs and the leaders of the Royalist
      party. The envoy was, in fact, arrested on the very day he landed&mdash;for
      he traveled by boat, disguised as a master mariner. However, as a man of
      practical intelligence, he had calculated all the risks of the
      undertaking; his passport and papers were all in order, and the men told
      off to take him were afraid of blundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier de Beauvoir&mdash;I now remember his name&mdash;had studied
      his part well; he appealed to the family whose name he had borrowed,
      persisted in his false address, and stood his examination so boldly that
      he would have been set at large but for the blind belief that the spies
      had in their instructions, which were unfortunately only too minute. In
      this dilemma the authorities were more ready to risk an arbitrary act than
      to let a man escape to whose capture the Minister attached great
      importance. In those days of liberty the agents of the powers in authority
      cared little enough for what we now regard as <i>legal</i>. The Chevalier
      was therefore imprisoned provisionally, until the superior officials
      should come to some decision as to his identity. He had not long to wait
      for it; orders were given to guard the prisoner closely in spite of his
      denials.

      &ldquo;The Chevalier de Beauvoir was next transferred, in obedience to further
      orders, to the Castle of l&rsquo;Escarpe, a name which sufficiently indicates
      its situation. This fortress, perched on very high rocks, has precipices
      for its trenches; it is reached on all sides by steep and dangerous paths;
      and, like every ancient castle, its principal gate has a drawbridge over a
      wide moat. The commandant of this prison, delighted to have charge of a
      man of family whose manners were most agreeable, who expressed himself
      well, and seemed highly educated, received the Chevalier as a godsend; he
      offered him the freedom of the place on parole, that they might together
      the better defy its dulness. The prisoner was more than content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauvoir was a loyal gentleman, but, unfortunately, he was also a very
      handsome youth. He had attractive features, a dashing air, a pleasing
      address, and extraordinary strength. Well made, active, full of
      enterprise, and loving danger, he would have made an admirable leader of
      guerillas, and was the very man for the part. The commandant gave his
      prisoner the most comfortable room, entertained him at his table, and at
      first had nothing but praise for the Vendean. This officer was a Corsican
      and married; his wife was pretty and charming, and he thought her,
      perhaps, not to be trusted&mdash;at any rate, he was as jealous as a
      Corsican and a rather ill-looking soldier may be. The lady took a fancy to
      Beauvoir, and he found her very much to his taste; perhaps they loved!
      Love in a prison is quick work. Did they commit some imprudence? Was the
      sentiment they entertained something warmer than the superficial gallantry
      which is almost a duty of men towards women?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauvoir never fully explained this rather obscure episode of the story;
      it is at least certain that the commandant thought himself justified in
      treating his prisoner with excessive severity. Beauvoir was placed in the
      dungeon, fed on black bread and cold water, and fettered in accordance
      with the time-honored traditions of the treatment lavished on captives.
      His cell, under the fortress-yard, was vaulted with hard stone, the walls
      were of desperate thickness; the tower overlooked the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the luckless man had convinced himself of the impossibility of
      escape, he fell into those day-dreams which are at once the comfort and
      the crowning despair of prisoners. He gave himself up to the trifles which
      in such cases seem so important; he counted the hours and the days; he
      studied the melancholy trade of being prisoner; he became absorbed in
      himself, and learned the value of air and sunshine; then, at the end of a
      fortnight, he was attacked by that terrible malady, that fever for
      liberty, which drives prisoners to those heroic efforts of which the
      prodigious achievements seem to us impossible, though true, and which my
      friend the doctor&rdquo; (and he turned to Bianchon) &ldquo;would perhaps ascribe to
      some unknown forces too recondite for his physiological analysis to
      detect, some mysteries of the human will of which the obscurity baffles
      science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bianchon shook his head in negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauvoir was eating his heart out, for death alone could set him free.
      One morning the turnkey, whose duty it was to bring him his food, instead
      of leaving him when he had given him his meagre pittance, stood with his
      arms folded, looking at him with strange meaning. Conversation between
      them was brief, and the warder never began it. The Chevalier was therefore
      greatly surprised when the man said to him: &lsquo;Of course, monsieur, you know
      your own business when you insist on being always called Monsieur Lebrun,
      or citizen Lebrun. It is no concern of mine; ascertaining your name is no
      part of my duty. It is all the same to me whether you call yourself Peter
      or Paul. If every man minds his own business, the cows will not stray. At
      the same time, <i>I</i> know,&rsquo; said he, with a wink, &lsquo;that you are
      Monsieur Charles-Felix-Theodore, Chevalier de Beauvoir, and cousin to
      Madame la Duchesse de Maille.&mdash;Heh?&rsquo; he added after a short silence,
      during which he looked at his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauvoir, seeing that he was safe under lock and key, did not imagine
      that his position could be any the worse if his real name were known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, and supposing I were the Chevalier de Beauvoir, what should I gain
      by that?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, there is everything to be gained by it,&rsquo; replied the jailer in an
      undertone. &lsquo;I have been paid to help you to get away; but wait a minute!
      If I were suspected in the smallest degree, I should be shot out of hand.
      So I have said that I will do no more in the matter than will just earn
      the money.&mdash;Look here,&rsquo; said he, taking a small file out of his
      pocket, &lsquo;this is your key; with this you can cut through one of your bars.
      By the Mass, but it will not be any easy job,&rsquo; he went on, glancing at the
      narrow loophole that let daylight into the dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in a splayed recess under the deep cornice that ran round the top
      of the tower, between the brackets that supported the embrasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;you must take care to saw through the iron low
      enough to get your body through.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will get through, never fear,&rsquo; said the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But high enough to leave a stanchion to fasten a cord to,&rsquo; the warder
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And where is the cord?&rsquo; asked Beauvoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the man, throwing down a knotted rope. &lsquo;It is made of
      raveled linen, that you may be supposed to have contrived it yourself, and
      it is long enough. When you have got to the bottom knot, let yourself drop
      gently, and the rest you must manage for yourself. You will probably find
      a carriage somewhere in the neighborhood, and friends looking out for you.
      But I know nothing about that.&mdash;I need not remind you that there is a
      man-at-arms to the right of the tower. You will take care, of course, to
      choose a dark night, and wait till the sentinel is asleep. You must take
      your chance of being shot; but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right! All right! At least I shall not rot here,&rsquo; cried the young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, that may happen nevertheless,&rsquo; replied the jailer, with a stupid
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauvoir thought this was merely one of the aimless remarks that such
      folks indulge in. The hope of freedom filled him with such joy that he
      could not be troubled to consider the words of a man who was no more than
      a better sort of peasant. He set to work at once, and had filed the bars
      through in the course of the day. Fearing a visit from the Governor, he
      stopped up the breaches with bread crumb rubbed in rust to make it look
      like iron; he hid his rope, and waited for a favorable night with the
      intensity of anticipation, the deep anguish of soul that makes a
      prisoner&rsquo;s life dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, one murky night, an autumn night, he finished cutting through
      the bars, tied the cord firmly to the stump, and perched himself on the
      sill outside, holding on by one hand to the piece of iron remaining. Then
      he waited for the darkest hour of the night, when the sentinels would
      probably be asleep; this would be not long before dawn. He knew the hours
      of their rounds, the length of each watch, every detail with which
      prisoners, almost involuntarily, become familiar. He waited till the
      moment when one of the men-at-arms had spent two-thirds of his watch and
      gone into his box for shelter from the fog. Then, feeling sure that the
      chances were at the best for his escape, he let himself down knot by knot,
      hanging between earth and sky, and clinging to his rope with the strength
      of a giant. All was well. At the last knot but one, just as he was about
      to let himself drop, a prudent impulse led him to feel for the ground with
      his feet, and he found no footing. The predicament was awkward for a man
      bathed in sweat, tired, and perplexed, and in a position where his life
      was at stake on even chances. He was about to risk it, when a trivial
      incident stopped him; his hat fell off; happily, he listened for the noise
      it must make in striking the ground, and he heard not a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner felt vaguely suspicious as to this state of affairs. He
      began to wonder whether the Commandant had not laid a trap for him&mdash;but
      if so, why? Torn by doubts, he almost resolved to postpone the attempt
      till another night. At any rate, he would wait for the first gleam of day,
      when it would still not be impossible to escape. His great strength
      enabled him to climb up again to his window; still, he was almost
      exhausted by the time he gained the sill, where he crouched on the
      lookout, exactly like a cat on the parapet of a gutter. Before long, by
      the pale light of dawn, he perceived as he waved the rope that there was a
      little interval of a hundred feet between the lowest knot and the pointed
      rocks below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, my friend, the Governor!&rsquo; said he, with characteristic
      coolness. Then, after a brief meditation on this skilfully-planned
      revenge, he thought it wise to return to his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He laid his outer clothes conspicuously on the bed, left the rope outside
      to make it seem that he had fallen, and hid himself behind the door to
      await the arrival of the treacherous turnkey, arming himself with one of
      the iron bars he had filed out. The jailer, who returned rather earlier
      than usual to secure the dead man&rsquo;s leavings, opened the door, whistling
      as he came in; but when he was at arm&rsquo;s length, Beauvoir hit him such a
      tremendous blow on the head that the wretch fell in a heap without a cry;
      the bar had cracked his skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier hastily stripped him and put on his clothes, mimicked his
      walk, and, thanks to the early hour and the undoubting confidence of the
      warders of the great gate, he walked out and away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem to strike either the lawyer or Madame de la Baudraye that
      there was in this narrative the least allusion that should apply to them.
      Those in the little plot looked inquiringly at each other, evidently
      surprised at the perfect coolness of the two supposed lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can tell you a better story than that,&rdquo; said Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear,&rdquo; said the audience, at a sign from Lousteau, conveying that
      Bianchon had a reputation as a story-teller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the stock of narratives he had in store, for every clever man has a
      fund of anecdotes as Madame de la Baudraye had a collection of phrases,
      the doctor chose that which is known as <i>La Grande Breteche</i>, and is
      so famous indeed, that it was put on the stage at the <i>Gymnase-Dramatique</i>
      under the title of <i>Valentine</i>. So it is not necessary to repeat it
      here, though it was then new to the inhabitants of the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy. And
      it was told with the same finish of gesture and tone which had won such
      praise for Bianchon when at Mademoiselle des Touches&rsquo; supper-party he had
      told it for the first time. The final picture of the Spanish grandee,
      starved to death where he stood in the cupboard walled up by Madame de
      Merret&rsquo;s husband, and that husband&rsquo;s last word as he replied to his wife&rsquo;s
      entreaty, &ldquo;You swore on that crucifix that there was no one in that
      closet!&rdquo; produced their full effect. There was a silent minute, highly
      flattering to Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye, &ldquo;love must be a
      mighty thing that it can tempt a woman to put herself in such a position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, who have certainly seen some strange things in the course of my life,&rdquo;
       said Gravier, &ldquo;was cognizant in Spain of an adventure of the same kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come forward after two great performers,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye,
      with coquettish flattery, as she glanced at the two Parisians. &ldquo;But never
      mind&mdash;proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some little time after his entry into Madrid,&rdquo; said the Receiver-General,
      &ldquo;the Grand Duke of Berg invited the magnates of the capital to an
      entertainment given to the newly conquered city by the French army. In
      spite of the splendor of the affair, the Spaniards were not very cheerful;
      their ladies hardly danced at all, and most of the company sat down to
      cards. The gardens of the Duke&rsquo;s palace were so brilliantly illuminated,
      that the ladies could walk about in as perfect safety as in broad
      daylight. The fete was of imperial magnificence. Nothing was grudged to
      give the Spaniards a high idea of the Emperor, if they were to measure him
      by the standard of his officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an arbor near the house, between one and two in the morning, a party
      of French officers were discussing the chances of war, and the not too
      hopeful outlook prognosticated by the conduct of the Spaniards present at
      that grand ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can only tell you,&rsquo; said the surgeon-major of the company of which I
      was paymaster, &lsquo;I applied formally to Prince Murat only yesterday to be
      recalled. Without being afraid exactly of leaving my bones in the
      Peninsula, I would rather dress the wounds made by our worthy neighbors
      the Germans. Their weapons do not run quite so deep into the body as these
      Castilian daggers. Besides, a certain dread of Spain is, with me, a sort
      of superstition. From my earliest youth I have read Spanish books, and a
      heap of gloomy romances and tales of adventures in this country have given
      me a serious prejudice against its manners and customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, now, since my arrival in Madrid, I have already been, not indeed
      the hero, but the accomplice of a dangerous intrigue, as dark and
      mysterious as any romance by Lady (Mrs.) Radcliffe. I am apt to attend to
      my presentiments, and I am off to-morrow. Murat will not refuse me leave,
      for, thanks to our varied services, we always have influential friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Since you mean to cut your stick, tell us what&rsquo;s up,&rsquo; said an old
      Republican colonel, who cared not a rap for Imperial gentility and choice
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surgeon-major looked about him cautiously, as if to make sure who
      were his audience, and being satisfied that no Spaniard was within
      hearing, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We are none but Frenchmen&mdash;then, with pleasure, Colonel Hulot.
      About six days since, I was quietly going home, at about eleven at night,
      after leaving General Montcornet, whose hotel is but a few yards from
      mine. We had come away together from the Quartermaster-General&rsquo;s, where we
      had played rather high at <i>bouillotte</i>. Suddenly, at the corner of a
      narrow high-street, two strangers, or rather, two demons, rushed upon me
      and flung a large cloak round my head and arms. I yelled out, as you may
      suppose, like a dog that is thrashed, but the cloth smothered my voice,
      and I was lifted into a chaise with dexterous rapidity. When my two
      companions released me from the cloak, I heard these dreadful words spoken
      by a woman, in bad French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"If you cry out, or if you attempt to escape, if you make the very least
      suspicious demonstration, the gentleman opposite to you will stab you
      without hesitation. So you had better keep quiet.&mdash;Now, I will tell
      you why you have been carried off. If you will take the trouble to put
      your hand out in this direction, you will find your case of instruments
      lying between us; we sent a messenger for them to your rooms, in your
      name. You will need them. We are taking you to a house that you may save
      the honor of a lady who is about to give birth to a child that she wishes
      to place in this gentleman&rsquo;s keeping without her husband&rsquo;s knowledge.
      Though monsieur rarely leaves his wife, with whom he is still passionately
      in love, watching over her with all the vigilance of Spanish jealousy, she
      had succeeded in concealing her condition; he believes her to be ill. You
      must bring the child into the world. The dangers of this enterprise do not
      concern us: only, you must obey us, otherwise the lover, who is sitting
      opposite to you in this carriage, and who does not understand a word of
      French, will kill you on the least rash movement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"And who are you?&rdquo; I asked, feeling for the speaker&rsquo;s hand, for her arm
      was inside the sleeve of a soldier&rsquo;s uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I am my lady&rsquo;s waiting-woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and ready to reward you with
      my own person if you show yourself gallant and helpful in our
      necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Gladly,&rdquo; said I, seeing that I was inevitably started on a perilous
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Under favor of the darkness, I felt whether the person and figure of the
      girl were in keeping with the idea I had formed of her from her tone of
      voice. The good soul had, no doubt, made up her mind from the first to
      accept all the chances of this strange act of kidnapping, for she kept
      silence very obligingly, and the coach had not been more than ten minutes
      on the way when she accepted and returned a very satisfactory kiss. The
      lover, who sat opposite to me, took no offence at an occasional quite
      involuntary kick; as he did not understand French, I conclude he paid no
      heed to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"I can be your mistress on one condition only,&rdquo; said the woman, in reply
      to the nonsense I poured into her ear, carried away by the fervor of an
      improvised passion, to which everything was unpropitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"And what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"That you will never attempt to find out whose servant I am. If I am to
      go to you, it must be at night, and you must receive me in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"Very good,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We had got as far as this, when the carriage drew up under a garden
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;"You must allow me to bandage your eyes,&rdquo; said the maid. &ldquo;You can lean
      on my arm, and I will lead you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She tied a handkerchief over my eyes, fastening it in a tight knot at
      the back of my head. I heard the sound of a key being cautiously fitted to
      the lock of a little side door by the speechless lover who had sat
      opposite to me. In a moment the waiting-woman, whose shape was slender,
      and who walked with an elegant jauntiness&rsquo;&mdash;<i>meneho</i>, as they
      call it,&rdquo; Monsieur Gravier explained in a superior tone, &ldquo;a word which
      describes the swing which women contrive to give a certain part of their
      dress that shall be nameless.&mdash;&lsquo;The waiting-woman&rsquo;&mdash;it is the
      surgeon-major who is speaking,&rdquo; the narrator went on&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;led me along
      the gravel walks of a large garden, till at a certain spot she stopped.
      From the louder sound of our footsteps, I concluded that we were close to
      the house. &ldquo;Now silence!&rdquo; said she in a whisper, &ldquo;and mind what you are
      about. Do not overlook any of my signals; I cannot speak without terrible
      danger for both of us, and at this moment your life is of the first
      importance.&rdquo; Then she added: &ldquo;My mistress is in a room on the ground
      floor. To get into it we must pass through her husband&rsquo;s room and close to
      his bed. Do not cough, walk softly, and follow me closely, so as not to
      knock against the furniture or tread anywhere but on the carpets I laid
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here the lover gave an impatient growl, as a man annoyed by so much
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The woman said no more, I heard a door open, I felt the warm air of the
      house, and we stole in like thieves. Presently the girl&rsquo;s light hand
      removed the bandage. I found myself in a lofty and spacious room, badly
      lighted by a smoky lamp. The window was open, but the jealous husband had
      fitted it with iron bars. I was in the bottom of a sack, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the ground a woman was lying on a mat; her head was covered with a
      muslin veil, but I could see her eyes through it full of tears and
      flashing with the brightness of stars; she held a handkerchief in her
      mouth, biting it so hard that her teeth were set in it: I never saw finer
      limbs, but her body was writhing with pain like a harp-string thrown on
      the fire. The poor creature had made a sort of struts of her legs by
      setting her feet against a chest of drawers, and with both hands she held
      on to the bar of a chair, her arms outstretched, with every vein painfully
      swelled. She might have been a criminal undergoing torture. But she did
      not utter a cry; there was not a sound, all three speechless and
      motionless. The husband snored with reassuring regularity. I wanted to
      study the waiting-woman&rsquo;s face, but she had put on a mask, which she had
      removed, no doubt, during our drive, and I could see nothing but a pair of
      black eyes and a pleasingly rounded figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The lover threw some towels over his mistress&rsquo; legs and folded the
      muslin veil double over her face. As soon as I had examined the lady with
      care, I perceived from certain symptoms which I had noted once before on a
      very sad occasion in my life, that the infant was dead. I turned to the
      maid in order to tell her this. Instantly the suspicious stranger drew his
      dagger; but I had time to explain the matter to the woman, who explained
      in a word or two to him in a low voice. On hearing my opinion, a quick,
      slight shudder ran through him from head to foot like a lightning flash; I
      fancied I could see him turn pale under his black velvet mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The waiting-woman took advantage of a moment when he was bending in
      despair over the dying woman, who had turned blue, to point to some
      glasses of lemonade standing on a table, at the same time shaking her head
      negatively. I understood that I was not to drink anything in spite of the
      dreadful thirst that parched my throat. The lover was thirsty too; he took
      an empty glass, poured out some fresh lemonade, and drank it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At this moment the lady had a violent attack of pain, which showed me
      that now was the time to operate. I summoned all my courage, and in about
      an hour had succeeded in delivering her of the child, cutting it up to
      extract it. The Spaniard no longer thought of poisoning me, understanding
      that I had saved the mother&rsquo;s life. Large tears fell on his cloak. The
      woman uttered no sound, but she trembled like a hunted animal, and was
      bathed in sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At one horribly critical moment she pointed in the direction of her
      husband&rsquo;s room; he had turned in his sleep, and she alone had heard the
      rustle of the sheets, the creaking of the bed or of the curtain. We all
      paused, and the lover and the waiting-woman, through the eyeholes of their
      masks, gave each other a look that said, &ldquo;If he wakes, shall we kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At that instant I put out my hand to take the glass of lemonade the
      Spaniard had drunk of. He, thinking that I was about to take one of the
      full glasses, sprang forward like a cat, and laid his long dagger over the
      two poisoned goblets, leaving me his own, and signing to me to drink what
      was left. So much was conveyed by this quick action, and it was so full of
      good feeling, that I forgave him his atrocious schemes for killing me, and
      thus burying every trace of this event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After two hours of care and alarms, the maid and I put her mistress to
      bed. The lover, forced into so perilous an adventure, had, to provide
      means in case of having to fly, a packet of diamonds stuck to paper; these
      he put into my pocket without my knowing it; and I may add
      parenthetically, that as I was ignorant of the Spaniard&rsquo;s magnificent
      gift, my servant stole the jewels the day after, and went off with a
      perfect fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I whispered my instructions to the waiting-woman as to the further care
      of her patient, and wanted to be gone. The maid remained with her
      mistress, which was not very reassuring, but I was on my guard. The lover
      made a bundle of the dead infant and the blood-stained clothes, tying it
      up tightly, and hiding it under his cloak; he passed his hand over my eyes
      as if to bid me to see nothing, and signed to me to take hold of the skirt
      of his coat. He went first out of the room, and I followed, not without a
      parting glance at my lady of an hour. She, seeing the Spaniard had gone
      out, snatched off her mask and showed me an exquisite face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When I found myself in the garden, in the open air, I confess that I
      breathed as if a heavy load had been lifted from my breast. I followed my
      guide at a respectful distance, watching his least movement with keen
      attention. Having reached the little door, he took my hand and pressed a
      seal to my lips, set in a ring which I had seen him wearing on a finger of
      his left hand, and I gave him to understand that this significant sign
      would be obeyed. In the street two horses were waiting; we each mounted
      one. My Spaniard took my bridle, held his own between his teeth, for his
      right hand held the bloodstained bundle, and we went off at lightning
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I could not see the smallest object by which to retrace the road we came
      by. At dawn I found myself close by my own door, and the Spaniard fled
      towards the Atocha gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you saw nothing which could lead you to suspect who the woman was
      whom you had attended?&rsquo; the Colonel asked of the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;One thing only,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;When I turned the unknown lady over, I
      happened to remark a mole on her arm, about half-way down, as big as a
      lentil, and surrounded with brown hairs.&rsquo;&mdash;At this instant the rash
      speaker turned pale. All our eyes, that had been fixed on his, followed
      his glance, and we saw a Spaniard, whose glittering eyes shone through a
      clump of orange-trees. On finding himself the object of our attention, the
      man vanished with the swiftness of a sylph. A young captain rushed in
      pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By Heaven!&rsquo; cried the surgeon, &lsquo;that basilisk stare has chilled me
      through, my friends. I can hear bells ringing in my ears! I may take leave
      of you; you will bury me here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What a fool you are!&rsquo; exclaimed Colonel Hulot. &lsquo;Falcon is on the track
      of the Spaniard who was listening, and he will call him to account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; cried one and another, seeing the captain return quite out of
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The devil&rsquo;s in it,&rsquo; said Falcon; &lsquo;the man went through a wall, I
      believe! As I do not suppose that he is a wizard, I fancy he must belong
      to the house! He knows every corner and turning, and easily escaped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am done for,&rsquo; said the surgeon, in a gloomy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, come, keep calm, Bega,&rsquo; said I (his name was Bega), &lsquo;we will sit
      on watch with you till you leave. We will not leave you this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of fact, three young officers who had been losing at play went
      home with the surgeon to his lodgings, and one of us offered to stay with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within two days Bega had obtained his recall to France; he made
      arrangements to travel with a lady to whom Murat had given a strong
      escort, and had just finished dinner with a party of friends, when his
      servant came to say that a young lady wished to speak to him. The surgeon
      and the three officers went down suspecting mischief. The stranger could
      only say, &lsquo;Be on your guard&mdash;&rsquo; when she dropped down dead. It was the
      waiting-woman, who, finding she had been poisoned, had hoped to arrive in
      time to warn her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Devil take it!&rsquo; cried Captain Falcon, &lsquo;that is what I call love! No
      woman on earth but a Spaniard can run about with a dose of poison in her
      inside!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bega remained strangely pensive. To drown the dark presentiments that
      haunted him, he sat down to table again, and with his companions drank
      immoderately. The whole party went early to bed, half drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the middle of the night the hapless Bega was aroused by the sharp
      rattle of the curtain rings pulled violently along the rods. He sat up in
      bed, in the mechanical trepidation which we all feel on waking with such a
      start. He saw standing before him a Spaniard wrapped in a cloak, who fixed
      on him the same burning gaze that he had seen through the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bega shouted out, &lsquo;Help, help, come at once, friends!&rsquo; But the Spaniard
      answered his cry of distress with a bitter laugh.&mdash;&lsquo;Opium grows for
      all!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having thus pronounced sentence as it were, the stranger pointed to the
      three other men sleeping soundly, took from under his cloak the arm of a
      woman, freshly amputated, and held it out to Bega, pointing to a mole like
      that he had so rashly described. &lsquo;Is it the same?&rsquo; he asked. By the light
      of the lantern the man had set on the bed, Bega recognized the arm, and
      his speechless amazement was answer enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without waiting for further information, the lady&rsquo;s husband stabbed him
      to the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell that to the marines!&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;It needs their robust
      faith to swallow it! Can you tell me which told the tale, the dead man or
      the Spaniard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Receiver-General, &ldquo;I nursed poor Bega, who died
      five days after in dreadful suffering.&mdash;That is not the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the time of the expedition sent out to restore Ferdinand VII. I was
      appointed to a place in Spain; but, happily for me, I got no further than
      Tours when I was promised the post of Receiver here at Sancerre. On the
      eve of setting out I was at a ball at Madame de Listomere&rsquo;s, where we were
      to meet several Spaniards of high rank. On rising from the card-table, I
      saw a Spanish grandee, an <i>afrancesado</i> in exile, who had been about
      a fortnight in Touraine. He had arrived very late at this ball&mdash;his
      first appearance in society&mdash;accompanied by his wife, whose right arm
      was perfectly motionless. Everybody made way in silence for this couple,
      whom we all watched with some excitement. Imagine a picture by Murillo
      come to life. Under black and hollow brows the man&rsquo;s eyes were like a
      fixed blaze; his face looked dried up, his bald skull was red, and his
      frame was a terror to behold, he was so emaciated. His wife&mdash;no, you
      cannot imagine her. Her figure had the supple swing for which the
      Spaniards created the word <i>meneho</i>; though pale, she was still
      beautiful; her complexion was dazzlingly fair&mdash;a rare thing in a
      Spaniard; and her gaze, full of the Spanish sun, fell on you like a stream
      of melted lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said I to her, towards the end of the evening, &lsquo;what occurrence
      led to the loss of your arm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I lost it in the war of independence,&rsquo; said she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spain is a strange country,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye. &ldquo;It still shows
      traces of Arab manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the journalist, laughing, &ldquo;the mania for cutting off arms is an
      old one there. It turns up every now and then like some of our newspaper
      hoaxes, for the subject has given plots for plays on the Spanish stage so
      early as 1570&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you think me capable of inventing such a story?&rdquo; said Monsieur
      Gravier, nettled by Lousteau&rsquo;s impertinent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite incapable of such a thing,&rdquo; said the journalist with grave irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Bianchon, &ldquo;the inventions of romances and play-writers are
      quite as often transferred from their books and pieces into real life, as
      the events of real life are made use of on the stage or adapted to a tale.
      I have seen the comedy of <i>Tartufe</i> played out&mdash;with the
      exception of the close; Orgon&rsquo;s eyes could not be opened to the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tragi-comedy of <i>Adolphe</i> by Benjamin Constant is constantly
      enacted,&rdquo; cried Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you suppose,&rdquo; asked Madame de la Baudraye, &ldquo;that such adventures
      as Monsieur Gravier has related could ever occur now, and in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Clagny, &ldquo;of the ten or twelve startling crimes that are
      annually committed in France, quite half are mixed up with circumstances
      at least as extraordinary as these, and often outdoing them in romantic
      details. Indeed, is not this proved by the reports in the <i>Gazette des
      Tribunaux</i>&mdash;the Police news&mdash;in my opinion, one of the worst
      abuses of the Press? This newspaper, which was started only in 1826 or
      &lsquo;27, was not in existence when I began my professional career, and the
      facts of the crime I am about to speak of were not known beyond the limits
      of the department where it was committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the quarter of Saint-Pierre-des-Corps at Tours a woman whose husband
      had disappeared at the time when the army of the Loire was disbanded, and
      who had mourned him deeply, was conspicuous for her excess of devotion.
      When the mission priests went through all the provinces to restore the
      crosses that had been destroyed and to efface the traces of revolutionary
      impiety, this widow was one of their most zealous proselytes, she carried
      a cross and nailed to it a silver heart pierced by an arrow; and, for a
      long time after, she went every evening to pray at the foot of the cross
      which was erected behind the Cathedral apse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, overwhelmed by remorse, she confessed to a horrible crime. She
      had killed her husband, as Fualdes was murdered, by bleeding him; she had
      salted the body and packed it in pieces into old casks, exactly as if it
      have been pork; and for a long time she had taken a piece every morning
      and thrown it into the Loire. Her confessor consulted his superiors, and
      told her that it would be his duty to inform the public prosecutor. The
      woman awaited the action of the Law. The public prosecutor and the
      examining judge, on examining the cellar, found the husband&rsquo;s head still
      in pickle in one of the casks.&mdash;&lsquo;Wretched woman,&rsquo; said the judge to
      the accused, &lsquo;since you were so barbarous as to throw your husband&rsquo;s body
      into the river, why did you not get rid of the head? Then there would have
      been no proof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I often tried, monsieur,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but it was too heavy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what became of the woman?&rdquo; asked the two Parisians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was sentenced and executed at Tours,&rdquo; replied the lawyer; &ldquo;but her
      repentance and piety had attracted interest in spite of her monstrous
      crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you suppose, said Bianchon, &ldquo;that we know all the tragedies that
      are played out behind the curtain of private life that the public never
      lifts?&mdash;It seems to me that human justice is ill adapted to judge of
      crimes as between husband and wife. It has every right to intervene as the
      police; but in equity it knows nothing of the heart of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The victim has in many cases been for so long the tormentor,&rdquo; said Madame
      de la Baudraye guilelessly, &ldquo;that the crime would sometimes seem almost
      excusable if the accused could tell all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply, led up to by Bianchon and by the story which Clagny had told,
      left the two Parisians excessively puzzled as to Dinah&rsquo;s position.
    </p>
    <p>
      At bedtime council was held, one of those discussions which take place in
      the passages of old country-houses where the bachelors linger, candle in
      hand, for mysterious conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Gravier was now informed of the object in view during this
      entertaining evening which had brought Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s innocence
      to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;our hostess&rsquo; serenity may indicate deep
      depravity instead of the most child-like innocence. The Public Prosecutor
      looks to me quite capable of suggesting that little La Baudraye should be
      put in pickle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not to return till to-morrow; who knows what may happen in the
      course of the night?&rdquo; said Gatien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will know!&rdquo; cried Monsieur Gravier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the life of a country house a number of practical jokes are considered
      admissible, some of them odiously treacherous. Monsieur Gravier, who had
      seen so much of the world, proposed setting seals on the door of Madame de
      la Baudraye and of the Public Prosecutor. The ducks that denounced the
      poet Ibycus are as nothing in comparison with the single hair that these
      country spies fasten across the opening of a door by means of two little
      flattened pills of wax, fixed so high up, or so low down, that the trick
      is never suspected. If the gallant comes out of his own door and opens the
      other, the broken hair tells the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everybody was supposed to be asleep, the doctor, the journalist, the
      receiver of taxes, and Gatien came barefoot, like robbers, and silently
      fastened up the two doors, agreeing to come again at five in the morning
      to examine the state of the fastenings. Imagine their astonishment and
      Gatien&rsquo;s delight when all four, candle in hand, and with hardly any
      clothes on, came to look at the hairs, and found them in perfect
      preservation on both doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the same wax?&rdquo; asked Monsieur Gravier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they the same hairs?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gatien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This quite alters the matter!&rdquo; cried Lousteau. &ldquo;You have been beating the
      bush for a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Gravier and Gatien exchanged questioning glances which were meant
      to convey, &ldquo;Is there not something offensive to us in that speech? Ought
      we to laugh or to be angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Dinah is virtuous,&rdquo; said the journalist in a whisper to Bianchon, &ldquo;she
      is worth an effort on my part to pluck the fruit of her first love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of carrying by storm a fortress that had for nine years stood out
      against the besiegers of Sancerre smiled on Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this notion in his head, he was the first to go down and into the
      garden, hoping to meet his hostess. And this chance fell out all the more
      easily because Madame de la Baudraye on her part wished to converse with
      her critic. Half such chances are planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were out shooting yesterday, monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye.
      &ldquo;This morning I am rather puzzled as to how to find you any new amusement;
      unless you would like to come to La Baudraye, where you may study more of
      our provincial life than you can see here, for you have made but one
      mouthful of my absurdities. However, the saying about the handsomest girl
      in the world is not less true of the poor provincial woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little simpleton Gatien has, I suppose, related to you a speech I
      made simply to make him confess that he adored you,&rdquo; said Etienne. &ldquo;Your
      silence, during dinner the day before yesterday and throughout the
      evening, was enough to betray one of those indiscretions which we never
      commit in Paris.&mdash;What can I say? I do not flatter myself that you
      will understand me. In fact, I laid a plot for the telling of all those
      stories yesterday solely to see whether I could rouse you and Monsieur de
      Clagny to a pang of remorse.&mdash;Oh! be quite easy; your innocence is
      fully proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had the slightest fancy for that estimable magistrate, you would
      have lost all your value in my eyes.&mdash;I love perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not, you cannot love that cold, dried-up, taciturn little usurer
      on wine casks and land, who would leave any man in the lurch for
      twenty-five centimes on a renewal. Oh, I have fully recognized Monsieur de
      la Baudraye&rsquo;s similarity to a Parisian bill-discounter; their nature is
      identical.&mdash;At eight-and-twenty, handsome, well conducted, and
      childless&mdash;I assure you, madame, I never saw the problem of virtue
      more admirably expressed.&mdash;The author of <i>Paquita la Sevillane</i>
      must have dreamed many dreams!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can speak of such things without the hypocritical gloss lent them by
      young men, for I am old before my time. I have no illusions left. Can a
      man have any illusions in the trade I follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By opening the game in this tone, Lousteau cut out all excursions in the
      <i>Pays de Tendre</i>, where genuine passion beats the bush so long; he
      went straight to the point and placed himself in a position to force the
      offer of what women often make a man pray for, for years; witness the
      hapless Public Prosecutor, to whom the greatest favor had consisted in
      clasping Dinah&rsquo;s hand to his heart more tenderly than usual as they
      walked, happy man!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Madame de la Baudraye, to be true to her reputation as a Superior
      Woman, tried to console the Manfred of the Press by prophesying such a
      future of love as he had not had in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sought pleasure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but you have never loved. Believe
      me, true love often comes late in life. Remember Monsieur de Gentz, who
      fell in love in his old age with Fanny Ellsler, and left the Revolution of
      July to take its course while he attended the dancer&rsquo;s rehearsals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me unlikely,&rdquo; replied Lousteau. &ldquo;I can still believe in love,
      but I have ceased to believe in woman. There are in me, I suppose, certain
      defects which hinder me from being loved, for I have often been thrown
      over. Perhaps I have too strong a feeling for the ideal&mdash;like all men
      who have looked too closely into reality&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye at last heard the mind of a man who, flung into the
      wittiest Parisian circles, represented to her its most daring axioms, its
      almost artless depravity, its advanced convictions; who, if he were not
      really superior, acted superiority extremely well. Etienne, performing
      before Dinah, had all the success of a first night. <i>Paquita</i> of
      Sancerre scented the storms, the atmosphere of Paris. She spent one of the
      most delightful days of her life with Lousteau and Bianchon, who told her
      strange tales about the great men of the day, the anecdotes which will
      some day form the <i>Ana</i> of our century; sayings and doings that were
      the common talk of Paris, but quite new to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Lousteau spoke very ill of the great female celebrity of Le
      Berry, with the obvious intention of flattering Madame de la Baudraye and
      leading her into literary confidences, by suggesting that she could rival
      so great a writer. This praise intoxicated Madame de la Baudraye; and
      Monsieur de Clagny, Monsieur Gravier, and Gatien, all thought her warmer
      in her manner to Etienne than she had been on the previous day. Dinah&rsquo;s
      three <i>attaches</i> greatly regretted having all gone to Sancerre to
      blow the trumpet in honor of the evening at Anzy; nothing, to hear them,
      had ever been so brilliant. The Hours had fled on feet so light that none
      had marked their pace. The two Parisians they spoke of as perfect
      prodigies.
    </p>
    <p>
      These exaggerated reports loudly proclaimed on the Mall brought sixteen
      persons to Anzy that evening, some in family coaches, some in wagonettes,
      and a few bachelors on hired saddle horses. By about seven o&rsquo;clock this
      provincial company had made a more or less graceful entry into the huge
      Anzy drawing-room, which Dinah, warned of the invasion, had lighted up,
      giving it all the lustre it was capable of by taking the holland covers
      off the handsome furniture, for she regarded this assembly as one of her
      great triumphs. Lousteau, Bianchon, and Dinah exchanged meaning looks as
      they studied the attitudes and listened to the speeches of these visitors,
      attracted by curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What invalided ribbons, what ancestral laces, what ancient flowers, more
      imaginative than imitative, were boldly displayed on some perennial caps!
      The Presidente Boirouge, Bianchon&rsquo;s cousin, exchanged a few words with the
      doctor, from whom she extracted some &ldquo;advice gratis&rdquo; by expatiating on
      certain pains in the chest, which she declared were nervous, but which he
      ascribed to chronic indigestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply drink a cup of tea every day an hour after dinner, as the English
      do, and you will get over it, for what you suffer from is an English
      malady,&rdquo; Bianchon replied very gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is certainly a great physician,&rdquo; said the Presidente, coming back to
      Madame de Clagny, Madame Popinot-Chandier, and Madame Gorju, the Mayor&rsquo;s
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; replied Madame de Clagny behind her fan, &ldquo;that Dinah sent for
      him, not so much with a view to the elections as to ascertain why she has
      no children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the first excitement of this success, Lousteau introduced the great
      doctor as the only possible candidate at the ensuing elections. But
      Bianchon, to the great satisfaction of the new Sous-prefet, remarked that
      it seemed to him almost impossible to give up science in favor of
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a physician without a practice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;could care to be returned
      as a deputy. Nominate statesmen, thinkers, men whose knowledge is
      universal, and who are capable of placing themselves on the high level
      which a legislator should occupy. That is what is lacking in our Chambers,
      and what our country needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two or three young ladies, some of the younger men, and the elder women
      stared at Lousteau as if he were a mountebank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Gatien Boirouge declares that Monsieur Lousteau makes twenty
      thousand francs a year by his writings,&rdquo; observed the Mayor&rsquo;s wife to
      Madame de Clagny. &ldquo;Can you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible? Why, a Public Prosecutor gets but a thousand crowns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Gatien,&rdquo; said Madame Chandier, &ldquo;get Monsieur Lousteau to talk a
      little louder. I have not heard him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pretty boots he wears,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Chandier to her brother,
      &ldquo;and how they shine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;patent leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau began to feel that he was too much on show, and saw in the
      manners of the good townsfolk indications of the desires that had brought
      them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trick can I play them?&rdquo; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the footman, so called&mdash;a farm-servant put into livery&mdash;brought
      in the letters and papers, and among them a packet of proof, which the
      journalist left for Bianchon; for Madame de la Baudraye, on seeing the
      parcel, of which the form and string were obviously from the printers,
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, does literature pursue you even here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not literature,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but a review in which I am now finishing a
      story to come out ten days hence. I have reached the stage of &lsquo;<i>To be
      concluded in our next</i>,&rsquo; so I was obliged to give my address to the
      printer. Oh, we eat very hard-earned bread at the hands of these
      speculators in black and white! I will give you a description of these
      editors of magazines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will the conversation begin?&rdquo; Madame de Clagny asked of Dinah, as
      one might ask, &ldquo;When do the fireworks go off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied we should hear some amusing stories,&rdquo; said Madame Popinot to
      her cousin, the Presidente Boirouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, when the good folks of Sancerre were beginning to murmur
      like an impatient pit, Lousteau observed that Bianchon was lost in
      meditation inspired by the wrapper round the proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Etienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here is the most fascinating romance possible on some spoiled proof
      used to wrap yours in. Here, read it. <i>Olympia, or Roman Revenge</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said Lousteau, taking the sheet the doctor held out to him,
      and he read aloud as follows:&mdash;

  companions&rsquo; cowardice, for they had
  no courage but in the open field, and
  dared not venture into Rome, looked
  at them with scorn.

  &ldquo;Then I go alone?&rdquo; said he. He
  seemed to reflect, and then he went
  on: &ldquo;You are poor wretches. I shall
  proceed alone, and have the rich
  booty to myself.&mdash;You hear me!
  Farewell.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;My Captain,&rdquo; said Lamberti, &ldquo;if
  you should be captured without
  having succeeded?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;God protects me!&rdquo; said Rinaldo,
  pointing to the sky.

  With these words he went out,
  and on his way he met the steward

      &ldquo;That is the end of the page,&rdquo; said Lousteau, to whom every one had
      listened devoutly.

      &ldquo;He is reading his work to us,&rdquo; said Gatien to Madame Popinot-Chandier&rsquo;s
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the first word, ladies,&rdquo; said the journalist, jumping at an
      opportunity of mystifying the natives, &ldquo;it is evident that the brigands
      are in a cave. But how careless romancers of that date were as to details
      which are nowadays so closely, so elaborately studied under the name of
      &lsquo;local color.&rsquo; If the robbers were in a cavern, instead of pointing to the
      sky he ought to have pointed to the vault above him.&mdash;In spite of
      this inaccuracy, Rinaldo strikes me as a man of spirit, and his appeal to
      God is quite Italian. There must have been a touch of local color in this
      romance. Why, what with brigands, and a cavern, and one Lamberti who could
      foresee future possibilities&mdash;there is a whole melodrama in that
      page. Add to these elements a little intrigue, a peasant maiden with her
      hair dressed high, short skirts, and a hundred or so of bad couplets.&mdash;Oh!
      the public will crowd to see it! And then Rinaldo&mdash;how well the name
      suits Lafont! By giving him black whiskers, tightly-fitting trousers, a
      cloak, a moustache, a pistol, and a peaked hat&mdash;if the manager of the
      Vaudeville Theatre were but bold enough to pay for a few newspaper
      articles, that would secure fifty performances, and six thousand francs
      for the author&rsquo;s rights, if only I were to cry it up in my columns.

  The Duchess of Bracciano found
  her glove. Adolphe, who had brought
  her back to the orange grove, might
  certainly have supposed that there
  was some purpose in her forgetful-
  ness, for at this moment the arbor
  was deserted. The sound of the fes-

  The puppet show that had been
  promised had attracted all the
  guests to the ballroom. Never had
  Olympia looked more beautiful.
  Her lover&rsquo;s eyes met hers with an
  answering glow, and they under-
  stood each other. There was a mo-

  souls, and impossible to describe.
  They sat down on the same bench
  where they had sat in the presence
  of the Cavaliere Paluzzi and the

    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take it! Our Rinaldo has vanished!&rdquo; cried Lousteau. &ldquo;But a literary
      man once started by this page would make rapid progress in the
      comprehension of the plot. The Duchesse Olympia is a lady who could
      intentionally forget her gloves in a deserted arbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless she may be classed between the oyster and head-clerk of an office,
      the two creatures nearest to marble in the zoological kingdom, it is
      impossible to discern in Olympia&mdash;&rdquo; Bianchon began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman of thirty,&rdquo; Madame de la Baudraye hastily interposed, fearing
      some all too medical term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Adolphe must be two-and-twenty,&rdquo; the doctor went on, &ldquo;for an Italian
      woman at thirty is equivalent to a Parisian of forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From these two facts, the romance may easily be reconstructed,&rdquo; said
      Lousteau. &ldquo;And this Cavaliere Paluzzi&mdash;what a man!&mdash;The style is
      weak in these two passages; the author was perhaps a clerk in the Excise
      Office, and wrote the novel to pay his tailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his time,&rdquo; said Bianchon, &ldquo;the censor flourished; you must show as
      much indulgence to a man who underwent the ordeal by scissors in 1805 as
      to those who went to the scaffold in 1793.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand in the least?&rdquo; asked Madame Gorju timidly of Madame de
      Clagny.

    <p>
      The Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s wife, who, to use a phrase of Monsieur Gravier&rsquo;s,
      might have put a Cossack to flight in 1814, straightened herself in her
      chair like a horseman in his stirrups, and made a face at her neighbor,
      conveying, &ldquo;They are looking at us; we must smile as if we understood.&rdquo;

  before the Duchess.

  &ldquo;His face was gloomy, his brow
  was dark with clouds, and a bitter
  smile lurked in his wrinkles.

  &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are under
  suspicion. If you are guilty, fly. If
  you are not, still fly; because,
  whether criminal or innocent, you
  will find it easier to defend yourself
  from a distance.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;I thank your Eminence for your
  solicitude,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The Duke of
  Bracciano will reappear when I find
  it needful to prove that he is alive.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardinal Borborigano!&rdquo; exclaimed Bianchon. &ldquo;By the Pope&rsquo;s keys! If you do
      not agree with me that there is a magnificent creation in the very name,
      if at those words <i>dress rustled in the silence</i> you do not feel all
      the poetry thrown into the part of Schedoni by Mrs. Radcliffe in <i>The
      Black Penitent</i>, you do not deserve to read a romance.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Dinah, who had some pity on the eighteen faces gazing
      up at Lousteau, &ldquo;I see how the story is progressing. I know it all. I am
      in Rome; I can see the body of a murdered husband whose wife, as bold as
      she is wicked, has made her bed on the crater of a volcano. Every night,
      at every kiss, she says to herself, &lsquo;All will be discovered!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see her,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;clasping Monsieur Adolphe in her arms,
      to her heart, throwing her whole life into a kiss?&mdash;Adolphe I see as
      a well-made young man, but not clever&mdash;the sort of man an Italian
      woman likes. Rinaldo hovers behind the scenes of a plot we do not know,
      but which must be as full of incident as a melodrama by Pixerecourt. Or we
      can imagine Rinaldo crossing the stage in the background like a figure in
      one of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, perhaps, is the husband,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de la Baudraye.

  &ldquo;No, here it is.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;What danger we have escaped!&rdquo;
 
  Olympia looked at the key, and
  fancied she recognized it as her own.
  But Rinaldo had changed it; his
  cunning had triumphed; he had the
  right key. Like a modern Cartouche,
  he was no less skilful than bold,
  and suspecting that nothing but a
  vast treasure could require a duchess
  to carry it constantly at her belt.

      &ldquo;That is the end of the chapter,&rdquo; said Lousteau. &ldquo;The fact of this
      tailpiece changes my views as to the authorship. To have his book got up,
      under the Empire, with vignettes engraved on wood, the writer must have
      been a Councillor of State, or Madame Barthelemy-Hadot, or the late
      lamented Desforges, or Sewrin.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;the waste sheet has been printed fair on one
      side only. In printer&rsquo;s lingo, it is a back sheet, or, to make it clearer,
      the other side which would have to be printed is covered all over with
      pages printed one above another, all experiments in making up. It would
      take too long to explain to you all the complications of a making-up
      sheet; but you may understand that it will show no more trace of the first
      twelve pages that were printed on it than you would in the least remember
      the first stroke of the bastinado if a Pasha condemned you to have fifty
      on the soles of your feet.&rdquo;

  Rinaldo saw no safer refuge than to
  make forthwith for the cellar where
  the treasures of the Bracciano fam-
  ily no doubt lay hid. As light of
  foot as Camilla sung by the Latin
  poet, he flew to the entrance to the
  Baths of Vespasian. The torchlight
  already flickered on the walls when
  Rinaldo, with the readiness be-
  stowed on him by nature, discovered
  the door concealed in the stone-

  hideous thought then flashed on

      &ldquo;Yes, this made-up sheet follows the waste sheet. The last page of the

      for another very much like it, is now&mdash;on the made-up sheet&mdash;in
      the palace of the Dukes of Bracciano, the story seems to me to be
      advancing to a conclusion of some kind. I hope it is as clear to you as it
      is to me.&mdash;I understand that the festivities are over, the lovers

      &ldquo;What has Madame Hadot of La Charite to do with it?&rdquo; the Presidente asked
      of her son.

      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;I beg you to go on,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye to Lousteau.

  and gave a shriek of despair when
  he had vainly sought any trace of a
  secret spring. It was impossible to
  ignore the horrible truth. The door,
  cleverly constructed to serve the
  vengeful purposes of the Duchess,
  could not be opened from within.
  Rinaldo laid his cheek against the
  wall in various spots; nowhere
  could he feel the warmer air from
  the passage. He had hoped he
  might find a crack that would show
  him where there was an opening in
  the wall, but nothing, nothing! The
  whole seemed to be of one block of
  marble.

  Then he gave a hollow roar like
  that of a hyaena&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we fancied that the cry of the hyaena was a recent invention of our
      own!&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;and here it was already known to the literature of
      the Empire. It is even introduced with a certain skill in natural history,

  A deep groan answered Rinaldo&rsquo;s
  cry, but in his alarm he took it for
  an echo, so weak and hollow was
  the sound. It could not proceed
  from any human breast.

  &ldquo;Santa Maria!&rdquo; said the voice.

  &ldquo;If I stir from this spot I shall
  never find it again,&rdquo; thought Ri-
  naldo, when he had recovered his
  usual presence of mind. &ldquo;If I knock,
  I shall be discovered. What am I
  to do?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo; asked the voice.

  &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried the brigand; &ldquo;do
  the toads here talk?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;I am the Duke of Bracciano.
  Whoever you may be, if you are not
  a follower of the Duchess&rsquo;, in the
  name of all the saints, come towards
  me.&rdquo;
 
  220         OLYMPIA

  &ldquo;I should have to know where to
  find you, Monsieur le Duc,&rdquo; said Ri-

  who knows himself to be necessary.

  &ldquo;I can see you, my friend, for my
  eyes are accustomed to the darkness.
  Listen: walk straight forward&mdash;
  good; now turn to the left&mdash;come
  on&mdash;this way. There, we are close
  to each other.&rdquo;
 
  Rinaldo putting out his hands as
  a precaution, touched some iron
  bars.

  &ldquo;I am being deceived,&rdquo; cried the
  bandit.

  &ldquo;No, you are touching my cage.

  &ldquo;How can the Duke of Bracciano

  &ldquo;My friend, I have been here for
  thirty months, standing up, unable
  to sit down&mdash;&mdash;But you, who are
  you?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;I am Rinaldo, prince of the Cam-

  &ldquo;God be praised! I am saved.
  An honest man would have been

   cried the Duke. &ldquo;Oh, my worthy

  &ldquo;<i>E verissimo</i>&rdquo; (most true).

  &ldquo;Do you happen to have&mdash;&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Yes, files, pincers&mdash;<i>Corpo di

  &ldquo;You will earn a handsome share

  &ldquo;You surprise me, Eccellenza!&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Listen to me, Rinaldo. I will

  &ldquo;You, her husband!&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Yes, I was wrong, no doubt.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;It is not the correct thing, to be
  sure,&rdquo; said Rinaldo.

  &ldquo;My jealousy was roused by the
  Duchess&rsquo; conduct,&rdquo; the Duke went
  on. &ldquo;The event proved me right. A
  young Frenchman fell in love with
  Olympia, and she loved him. I had
  proofs of their reciprocal affection
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me, ladies,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;but I find it impossible to go
      on without remarking to you how direct this Empire literature is, going to
      the point without any details, a characteristic, as it seems to me, of a
      primitive time. The literature of that period holds a place between the
      summaries of chapters in <i>Telemaque</i> and the categorical reports of a
      public office. It had ideas, but refrained from expressing them, it was so
      scornful! It was observant, but would not communicate its observations to
      any one, it was so miserly! Nobody but Fouche ever mentioned what he had
      observed. &lsquo;At that time,&rsquo; to quote the words of one of the most imbecile
      critics in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, &lsquo;literature was content with
      a clear sketch and the simple outline of all antique statues. It did not
      dance over its periods.&rsquo;&mdash;I should think not! It had no periods to
      dance over. It had no words to play with. You were plainly told that Lubin
      loved Toinette; that Toinette did not love Lubin; that Lubin killed
      Toinette and the police caught Lubin, who was put in prison, tried at the
      assizes, and guillotined.&mdash;A strong sketch, a clear outline! What a
      noble drama! Well, in these days the barbarians make words sparkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a hair in a frost,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Clagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So those are the airs you affect?&rdquo;[*] retorted Lousteau.

    &ldquo;Et quelquefois les <i>morts</i>,&rdquo; dit Monsieur de Clagny.

    &ldquo;Ah! Lousteau! vous vous donnez de ces R-la (airs-la).&rdquo;
 
    Literally: &ldquo;And sometimes the dead.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, are those the airs you
    assume?&rdquo;&mdash;the play on the insertion of the letter R (<i>mots,
    morts</i>) has no meaning in English.

      &ldquo;What can he mean?&rdquo; asked Madame de Clagny, puzzled by this vile pun.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to be walking in the dark,&rdquo; replied the Mayoress.

    <p>
      &ldquo;The jest would be lost in an explanation,&rdquo; remarked Gatien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; Lousteau went on, &ldquo;a novelist draws characters, and instead of
      a &lsquo;simple outline,&rsquo; he unveils the human heart and gives you some interest

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I am alarmed at the progress of public knowledge in the
      matter of literature,&rdquo; said Bianchon. &ldquo;Like the Russians, beaten by
      Charles XII., who at least learned the art of war, the reader has learned
      the art of writing. Formerly all that was expected of a romance was that
      it should be interesting. As to style, no one cared for that, not even the
      author; as to ideas&mdash;zero; as to local color&mdash;<i>non est</i>. By
      degrees the reader has demanded style, interest, pathos, and complete
      information; he insists on the five literary senses&mdash;Invention,
      Style, Thought, Learning, and Feeling. Then some criticism commenting on
      everything. The critic, incapable of inventing anything but calumny,
      pronounces every work that proceeds from a not perfect brain to be
      deformed. Some magicians, as Walter Scott, for instance, having appeared
      in the world, who combined all the five literary senses, such writers as
      had but one&mdash;wit or learning, style or feeling&mdash;these cripples,
      these acephalous, maimed or purblind creatures&mdash;in a literary sense&mdash;have
      taken to shrieking that all is lost, and have preached a crusade against
      men who were spoiling the business, or have denounced their works.&rdquo;

  I then wished to make sure of my
  misfortune that I might be avenged
  under the protection of Providence
  and the Law. The Duchess guessed
  my intentions. We were at war in
  our purposes before we fought with
  poison in our hands. We tried to
  tempt each other to such confidence
  as we could not feel, I to induce her
  to drink a potion, she to get posses-
  sion of me. She was a woman, and
  she won the day; for women have a
  snare more than we men. I fell into
  it&mdash;I was happy; but I awoke next
  day in this iron cage. All through
  the day I bellowed with rage in the

          OR ROMAN REVENGE         225

  darkness of this cellar, over which
  is the Duchess&rsquo; bedroom. At night
  an ingenious counterpoise acting as
  a lift raised me through the floor,
  and I saw the Duchess in her lover&rsquo;s
  arms. She threw me a piece of
  bread, my daily pittance.

  &ldquo;Thus have I lived for thirty
  months! From this marble prison
  my cries can reach no ear. There is
  no chance for me. I will hope no
  more. Indeed, the Duchess&rsquo; room is

  and when I am carried up there
  none can hear my voice. Each time

  her lover. I crave it for myself, but

  I had not reckoned on robbers!&rdquo;

  wide awake.&rdquo;

  &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Good. I hear the clatter of the

  was.

  &ldquo;No more than my father,&rdquo; cried
  the Duke.

  &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; said Rinaldo. &ldquo;Lord!

  Never had the Duchess been more
  lovely; she came from her bath
  clothed like a goddess, and on seeing

  234            OLYMPIA

  Adolphe voluptuously reclining on
  piles of cushions&mdash;

  &ldquo;You are beautiful,&rdquo; said she.

  &ldquo;And so are you, Olympia!&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;And you still love me?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;More and more,&rdquo; said he.

  &ldquo;Ah, none but a Frenchman
  knows how to love!&rdquo; cried the
  Duchess. &ldquo;Do you love me well to-
  night?&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 
  &ldquo;Then come!&rdquo;
 
  And with an impulse of love and
  hate&mdash;whether it was that Cardinal
  Borborigano had reminded her of
  her husband, or that she felt un-
  wonted passion to display, she
  pressed the springs and held out her
  arms.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;for the foreman has torn off the rest in
      wrapping up my proofs. But it is enough to show that the author was full
      of promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make head or tail of it,&rdquo; said Gatien Boirouge, who was the
      first to break the silence of the party from Sancerre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; replied Monsieur Gravier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is a novel of the time of the Empire,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way in which the brigand is made to speak,&rdquo; said Monsieur Gravier,
      &ldquo;it is evident that the author knew nothing of Italy. Banditti do not
      allow themselves such graceful conceits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Gorju came up to Bianchon, seeing him pensive, and with a glance
      towards her daughter Mademoiselle Euphemie Gorju, the owner of a fairly
      good fortune&mdash;&ldquo;What a rhodomontade!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The prescriptions you
      write are worth more than all that rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mayoress had elaborately worked up this speech, which, in her opinion,
      showed strong judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, we must be lenient, we have but twenty pages out of a
      thousand,&rdquo; said Bianchon, looking at Mademoiselle Gorju, whose figure
      threatened terrible things after the birth of her first child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur de Clagny,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;we were talking yesterday of
      the forms of revenge invented by husbands. What do you say to those
      invented by wives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; replied the Public Prosecutor, &ldquo;that the romance is not by a
      Councillor of State, but by a woman. For extravagant inventions the
      imagination of women far outdoes that of men; witness <i>Frankenstein</i>
      by Mrs. Shelley, <i>Leone Leoni</i> by George Sand, the works of Anne
      Radcliffe, and the <i>Nouveau Promethee</i> (New Prometheus) of Camille de
      Maupin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah looked steadily at Monsieur de Clagny, making him feel, by an
      expression that gave him a chill, that in spite of the illustrious
      examples he had quoted, she regarded this as a reflection on <i>Paquita la
      Sevillane</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said little Baudraye, &ldquo;the Duke of Bracciano, whom his wife puts
      into a cage, and to whom she shows herself every night in the arms of her
      lover, will kill her&mdash;and do you call that revenge?&mdash;Our laws
      and our society are far more cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, little La Baudraye is talking!&rdquo; said Monsieur Boirouge to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the woman is left to live on a small allowance, the world turns its
      back on her, she has no more finery, and no respect paid her&mdash;the two
      things which, in my opinion, are the sum-total of woman,&rdquo; said the little
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she has happiness!&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the master of the house, lighting his candle to go to bed, &ldquo;for
      she has a lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a man who thinks of nothing but his vine-stocks and poles, he has
      some spunk,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he must have something!&rdquo; replied Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye, the only person who could hear Bianchon&rsquo;s remark,
      laughed so knowingly, and at the same time so bitterly, that the physician
      could guess the mystery of this woman&rsquo;s life; her premature wrinkles had
      been puzzling him all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dinah did not guess, on her part, the ominous prophecy contained for
      her in her husband&rsquo;s little speech, which her kind old Abbe Duret, if he
      had been alive, would not have failed to elucidate. Little La Baudraye had
      detected in Dinah&rsquo;s eyes, when she glanced at the journalist returning the
      ball of his jests, that swift and luminous flash of tenderness which gilds
      the gleam of a woman&rsquo;s eye when prudence is cast to the winds, and she is
      fairly carried away. Dinah paid no more heed to her husband&rsquo;s hint to her
      to observe the proprieties than Lousteau had done to Dinah&rsquo;s significant
      warnings on the day of his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any other man than Bianchon would have been surprised at Lousteau&rsquo;s
      immediate success; but he was so much the doctor, that he was not even
      nettled at Dinah&rsquo;s marked preference for the newspaper-rather than the
      prescription-writer! In fact, Dinah, herself famous, was naturally more
      alive to wit than to fame. Love generally prefers contrast to similitude.
      Everything was against the physician&mdash;his frankness, his simplicity,
      and his profession. And this is why: Women who want to love&mdash;and
      Dinah wanted to love as much as to be loved&mdash;have an instinctive
      aversion for men who are devoted to an absorbing occupation; in spite of
      superiority, they are all women in the matter of encroachment. Lousteau, a
      poet and journalist, and a libertine with a veneer of misanthropy, had
      that tinsel of the intellect, and led the half-idle life that attracts
      women. The blunt good sense and keen insight of the really great man
      weighed upon Dinah, who would not confess her own smallness even to
      herself. She said in her mind&mdash;&ldquo;The doctor is perhaps the better man,
      but I do not like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, she reflected on his professional duties, wondering whether a
      woman could ever be anything but a <i>subject</i> to a medical man, who
      saw so many subjects in the course of a day&rsquo;s work. The first sentence of
      the aphorism written by Bianchon in her album was a medical observation
      striking so directly at woman, that Dinah could not fail to be hit by it.
      And then Bianchon was leaving on the morrow; his practice required his
      return. What woman, short of having Cupid&rsquo;s mythological dart in her
      heart, could decide in so short a time?
    </p>
    <p>
      These little things, which lead to such great catastrophes&mdash;having
      been seen in a mass by Bianchon, he pronounced the verdict he had come to
      as to Madame de la Baudraye in a few words to Lousteau, to the
      journalist&rsquo;s great amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the two friends stood talking together, a storm was gathering in the
      Sancerre circle, who could not in the least understand Lousteau&rsquo;s
      paraphrases and commentaries, and who vented it on their hostess. Far from
      finding in his talk the romance which the Public Prosecutor, the
      Sous-prefet, the Presiding Judge, and his deputy, Lebas, had discovered
      there&mdash;to say nothing of Monsieur de la Baudraye and Dinah&mdash;the
      ladies now gathered round the tea-table, took the matter as a practical
      joke, and accused the Muse of Sancerre of having a finger in it. They had
      all looked forward to a delightful evening, and had all strained in vain
      every faculty of their mind. Nothing makes provincial folks so angry as
      the notion of having been a laughing-stock for Paris folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Piedefer left the table to say to her daughter, &ldquo;Do go and talk to
      the ladies; they are quite annoyed by your behavior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau could not fail to see Dinah&rsquo;s great superiority over the best
      women of Sancerre; she was better dressed, her movements were graceful,
      her complexion was exquisitely white by candlelight&mdash;in short, she
      stood out against this background of old faces, shy and ill-dressed girls,
      like a queen in the midst of her court. Visions of Paris faded from his
      brain; Lousteau was accepting the provincial surroundings; and while he
      had too much imagination to remain unimpressed by the royal splendor of
      this chateau, the beautiful carvings, and the antique beauty of the rooms,
      he had also too much experience to overlook the value of the personality
      which completed this gem of the Renaissance. So by the time the visitors
      from Sancerre had taken their leave one by one&mdash;for they had an
      hour&rsquo;s drive before them&mdash;when no one remained in the drawing-room
      but Monsieur de Clagny, Monsieur Lebas, Gatien, and Monsieur Gravier, who
      were all to sleep at Anzy&mdash;the journalist had already changed his
      mind about Dinah. His opinion had gone through the evolution that Madame
      de la Baudraye had so audaciously prophesied at their first meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what things they will say about us on the drive home!&rdquo; cried the
      mistress of the house, as she returned to the drawing-room after seeing
      the President and the Presidente to their carriage with Madame and
      Mademoiselle Popinot-Chandier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening had its pleasant side. In the intimacy of a small
      party each one brought to the conversation his contribution of epigrams on
      the figure the visitors from Sancerre had cut during Lousteau&rsquo;s comments
      on the paper wrapped round the proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Bianchon to Lousteau as they went to bed&mdash;they
      had an enormous room with two beds in it&mdash;&ldquo;you will be the happy man
      of this woman&rsquo;s choice&mdash;<i>nee</i> Piedefer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite natural. You are supposed here to have had many mistresses in
      Paris; and to a woman there is something indescribably inviting in a man
      whom other women favor&mdash;something attractive and fascinating; is it
      that she prides herself on being longer remembered than all the rest? that
      she appeals to his experience, as a sick man will pay more to a famous
      physician? or that she is flattered by the revival of a world-worn heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity and the senses count for so much in love affairs,&rdquo; said Lousteau,
      &ldquo;that there may be some truth in all those hypotheses. However, if I
      remain, it will be in consequence of the certificate of innocence, without
      ignorance, that you have given Dinah. She is handsome, is she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love will make her beautiful,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And, after all, she will
      be a rich widow some day or other! And a child would secure her the
      life-interest in the Master of La Baudraye&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is quite an act of virtue to make love to her,&rdquo; said Lousteau,
      rolling himself up in the bed-clothes, &ldquo;and to-morrow, with your help&mdash;yes,
      to-morrow, I&mdash;well, good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, Madame de la Baudraye, to whom her husband had six
      months since given a pair of horses, which he also used in the fields, and
      an old carriage that rattled on the road, decided that she would take
      Bianchon so far on his way as Cosne, where he would get into the Lyons
      diligence as it passed through. She also took her mother and Lousteau, but
      she intended to drop her mother at La Baudraye, to go on to Cosne with the
      two Parisians, and return alone with Etienne. She was elegantly dressed,
      as the journalist at once perceived&mdash;bronze kid boots, gray silk
      stockings, a muslin dress, a green silk scarf with shaded fringe at the
      ends, and a pretty black lace bonnet with flowers in it. As to Lousteau,
      the wretch had assumed his war-paint&mdash;patent leather boots, trousers
      of English kerseymere with pleats in front, a very open waistcoat showing
      a particularly fine shirt and the black brocade waterfall of his handsome
      cravat, and a very thin, very short black riding-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny and Monsieur Gravier looked at each other, feeling
      rather silly as they beheld the two Parisians in the carriage, while they,
      like two simpletons, were left standing at the foot of the steps. Monsieur
      de la Baudraye, who stood at the top waving his little hand in a little
      farewell to the doctor, could not forbear from smiling as he heard
      Monsieur de Clagny say to Monsieur Gravier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have escorted them on horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Gatien, riding Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s quiet little
      mare, came out of the side road from the stables and joined the party in
      the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good,&rdquo; said the Receiver-General, &ldquo;the boy has mounted guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bore!&rdquo; cried Dinah as she saw Gatien. &ldquo;In thirteen years&mdash;for
      I have been married nearly thirteen years&mdash;I have never had three
      hours&rsquo; liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, madame?&rdquo; said the journalist with a smile. &ldquo;You remind me of a
      saying of Michaud&rsquo;s&mdash;he was so witty! He was setting out for the Holy
      Land, and his friends were remonstrating with him, urging his age, and the
      perils of such an expedition. &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;you are married.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Married!&rsquo; 
      said he, &lsquo;so little married.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the rigid Madame Piedefer could not repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised to see Monsieur de Clagny mounted on my pony to
      complete the escort,&rdquo; said Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the Public Prosecutor does not pursue us, you can get rid of
      this little fellow at Sancerre. Bianchon must, of course, have left
      something behind on his table&mdash;the notes for the first lecture of his
      course&mdash;and you can ask Gatien to go back to Anzy to fetch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This simple little plot put Madame de la Baudraye into high spirits. From
      the road between Anzy to Sancerre, a glorious landscape frequently comes
      into view, of the noble stretches of the Loire, looking like a lake, and
      it was got over very pleasantly, for Dinah was happy in finding herself
      well understood. Love was discussed in theory, a subject allowing lovers
      <i>in petto</i> to take the measure, as it were, of each other&rsquo;s heart.
      The journalist took a tone of refined corruption to prove that love obeys
      no law, that the character of the lovers gives infinite variety to its
      incidents, that the circumstances of social life add to the multiplicity
      of its manifestations, that in love all is possible and true, and that any
      given woman, after resisting every temptation and the seductions of the
      most passionate lover, may be carried off her feet in the course of a few
      hours by a fancy, an internal whirlwind of which God alone would ever know
      the secret!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is not that the key to all the adventures we have talked
      over these three days past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For these three days, indeed, Dinah&rsquo;s lively imagination had been full of
      the most insidious romances, and the conversation of the two Parisians had
      affected the woman as the most mischievous reading might have done.
      Lousteau watched the effects of this clever manoeuvre, to seize the moment
      when his prey, whose readiness to be caught was hidden under the
      abstraction caused by irresolution, should be quite dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah wished to show La Baudraye to her two visitors, and the farce was
      duly played out of remembering the papers left by Bianchon in his room at
      Anzy. Gatien flew off at a gallop to obey his sovereign; Madame Piedefer
      went to do some shopping in Sancerre; and Dinah went on to Cosne alone
      with the two friends. Lousteau took his seat by the lady, Bianchon riding
      backwards. The two friends talked affectionately and with deep compassion
      for the fate of this choice nature so ill understood and in the midst of
      such vulgar surroundings. Bianchon served Lousteau well by making fun of
      the Public Prosecutor, of Monsieur Gravier, and of Gatien; there was a
      tone of such genuine contempt in his remarks, that Madame de la Baudraye
      dared not take the part of her adorers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly understand the position you have maintained,&rdquo; said the doctor
      as they crossed the Loire. &ldquo;You were inaccessible excepting to that
      brain-love which often leads to heart-love; and not one of those men, it
      is very certain, is capable of disguising what, at an early stage of life,
      is disgusting to the senses in the eyes of a refined woman. To you, now,
      love is indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indispensable!&rdquo; cried Dinah, looking curiously at the doctor. &ldquo;Do you
      mean that you prescribe love to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on living as you live now, in three years you will be hideous,&rdquo;
       replied Bianchon in a dictatorial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye, almost frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my friend,&rdquo; said Lousteau, half jestingly. &ldquo;He is always the
      medical man, and to him love is merely a question of hygiene. But he is
      quite disinterested&mdash;it is for your sake only that he speaks&mdash;as
      is evident, since he is starting in an hour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Cosne a little crowd gathered round the old repainted chaise, with the
      arms on the panels granted by Louis XIV. to the new La Baudraye. Gules, a
      pair of scales or; on a chief azure (color on color) three cross-crosslets
      argent. For supporters two greyhounds argent, collared azure, chained or.
      The ironical motto, <i>Deo sic patet fides et hominibus</i>, had been
      inflicted on the converted Calvinist by Hozier the satirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get out; they will come and find us,&rdquo; said the Baroness, desiring
      her coachman to keep watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah took Bianchon&rsquo;s arm, and the doctor set off by the banks of the
      Loire at so rapid a pace that the journalist had to linger behind. The
      physician had explained by a single wink that he meant to do Lousteau a
      good turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been attracted by Etienne,&rdquo; said Bianchon to Dinah; &ldquo;he has
      appealed strongly to your imagination; last night we were talking about
      you.&mdash;He loves you. But he is frivolous, and difficult to hold; his
      poverty compels him to live in Paris, while everything condemns you to
      live at Sancerre.&mdash;Take a lofty view of life. Make Lousteau your
      friend; do not ask too much of him; he will come three times a year to
      spend a few days with you, and you will owe to him your beauty, happiness,
      and fortune. Monsieur de la Baudraye may live to be a hundred; but he
      might die in a few days if he should leave off the flannel winding-sheet
      in which he swathes himself. So run no risks, be prudent both of you.&mdash;Say
      not a work&mdash;I have read your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye was defenceless under this serried attack, and in
      the presence of a man who spoke at once as a doctor, a confessor, and
      confidential friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Can you suppose that any woman would care to compete
      with a journalist&rsquo;s mistresses?&mdash;Monsieur Lousteau strikes me as
      agreeable and witty; but he is <i>blase</i>, etc., etc.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah had turned back, and was obliged to check the flow of words by which
      she tried to disguise her intentions; for Etienne, who seemed to be
      studying progress in Cosne, was coming to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said Bianchon, &ldquo;what he wants is to be truly loved; and if
      he alters his course of life, it will be to the benefit of his talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah&rsquo;s coachman hurried up breathlessly to say that the diligence had
      come in, and they walked on quickly, Madame de la Baudraye between the two
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my children!&rdquo; said Bianchon, before they got into the town,
      &ldquo;you have my blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s hand from his arm, and allowed
      Lousteau to draw it into his, with a tender look, as he pressed it to his
      heart. What a difference to Dinah! Etienne&rsquo;s arm thrilled her deeply.
      Bianchon&rsquo;s had not stirred her in the least. She and the journalist
      exchanged one of those glowing looks that are more than an avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only provincial women wear muslin gowns in these days,&rdquo; thought Lousteau
      to himself, &ldquo;the only stuff which shows every crease. This woman, who has
      chosen me for her lover, will make a fuss over her frock! If she had but
      put on a foulard skirt, I should be happy.&mdash;What is the meaning of
      these difficulties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Lousteau was wondering whether Dinah had put on a muslin gown on
      purpose to protect herself by an insuperable obstacle, Bianchon, with the
      help of the coachman, was seeing his luggage piled on the diligence.
      Finally, he came to take leave of Dinah, who was excessively friendly with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, Madame la Baronne, leave me here&mdash;Gatien will be coming,&rdquo;
       he added in an undertone. &ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; said he aloud. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;great man!&rdquo; cried Lousteau, shaking hands with Bianchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the journalist and Madame de la Baudraye, side by side in the rickety
      old chaise, had recrossed the Loire, they both were unready to speak. In
      these circumstances, the first words that break the silence are full of
      terrible meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how much I love you?&rdquo; said the journalist point blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victory might gratify Lousteau, but defeat could cause him no grief. This
      indifference was the secret of his audacity. He took Madame de la
      Baudraye&rsquo;s hand as he spoke these decisive words, and pressed it in both
      his; but Dinah gently released it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am as good as an actress or a <i>grisette</i>,&rdquo; she said in a
      voice that trembled, though she spoke lightly. &ldquo;But can you suppose that a
      woman who, in spite of her absurdities, has some intelligence, will have
      reserved the best treasures of her heart for a man who will regard her
      merely as a transient pleasure?&mdash;I am not surprised to hear from your
      lips the words which so many men have said to me&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coachman turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Monsieur Gatien,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, I will have you, you shall be mine, for I have never felt for
      any woman the passion I have for you!&rdquo; said Lousteau in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of my will, perhaps?&rdquo; said she, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you must seem to have been assaulted to save my honor,&rdquo; said the
      Parisian, to whom the fatal immaculateness of clean muslin suggested a
      ridiculous notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Gatien had reached the end of the bridge, the outrageous journalist
      had crumpled up Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s muslin dress to such an effect
      that she was absolutely not presentable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo; she exclaimed in dignified reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defied me,&rdquo; said the Parisian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gatien now rode up with the vehemence of a duped lover. To regain a
      little of Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s esteem, Lousteau did his best to hide
      the tumbled dress from Gatien&rsquo;s eyes by leaning out of the chaise to speak
      to him from Dinah&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to our inn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is still time; the diligence does
      not start for half an hour. The papers are on the table of the room
      Bianchon was in; he wants them particularly, for he will be lost without
      his notes for the lecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray go, Gatien,&rdquo; said Dinah to her young adorer, with an imperious
      glance. And the boy thus commanded turned his horse and was off with a
      loose rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quickly to La Baudraye,&rdquo; cried Lousteau to the coachman. &ldquo;Madame is
      not well&mdash;Your mother only will know the secret of my trick,&rdquo; added
      he, taking his seat by Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call such infamous conduct a trick?&rdquo; cried Madame de la Baudraye,
      swallowing down a few tears that dried up with the fire of outraged pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in the corner of the chaise, crossed her arms, and gazed
      out at the Loire and the landscape, at anything rather than at Lousteau.
      The journalist put on his most ingratiating tone, and talked till they
      reached La Baudraye, where Dinah fled indoors, trying not to be seen by
      any one. In her agitation she threw herself on a sofa and burst into
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am an object of horror to you, of aversion or scorn, I will go,&rdquo;
       said Lousteau, who had followed her. And he threw himself at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this crisis that Madame Piedefer came in, saying to her
      daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give your daughter another dress at once,&rdquo; said the audacious Parisian in
      the prim old lady&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the mad gallop of Gatien&rsquo;s horse, Madame de la Baudraye fled to
      her bedroom, followed by her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no papers at the inn,&rdquo; said Gatien to Lousteau, who went out to
      meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found none at the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy either?&rdquo; replied Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been making a fool of me,&rdquo; said Gatien, in a cold, set voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied Lousteau. &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye was greatly annoyed
      by your choosing to follow her without being invited. Believe me, to bore
      a woman is a bad way of courting her. Dinah has played you a trick, and
      you have given her a laugh; it is more than any of you has done in these
      thirteen years past. You owe that success to Bianchon, for your cousin was
      the author of the Farce of the &lsquo;Manuscript.&rsquo;&mdash;Will the horse get over
      it?&rdquo; asked Lousteau with a laugh, while Gatien was wondering whether to be
      angry or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse!&rdquo; said Gatien.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Madame de la Baudraye came in, dressed in a velvet gown,
      and accompanied by her mother, who shot angry flashes at Lousteau. It
      would have been too rash for Dinah to seem cold or severe to Lousteau in
      Gatien&rsquo;s presence; and Etienne, taking advantage of this, offered his arm
      to the supposed Lucretia; however, she declined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to cast off a man who has vowed to live for you?&rdquo; said he,
      walking close beside her. &ldquo;I shall stop at Sancerre and go home
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming, mamma?&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye to Madame Piedefer,
      thus avoiding a reply to the direct challenge by which Lousteau was
      forcing her to a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau handed the mother into the chaise, he helped Madame de la
      Baudraye by gently taking her arm, and he and Gatien took the front seat,
      leaving the saddle horse at La Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have changed your gown,&rdquo; said Gatien, blunderingly, to Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Baronne was chilled by the cool air off the river,&rdquo; replied
      Lousteau. &ldquo;Bianchon advised her to put on a warm dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah turned as red as a poppy, and Madame Piedefer assumed a stern
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bianchon! he is on the road to Paris. A noble soul!&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Madame de la Baudraye, &ldquo;he is high-minded, full of
      delicate feeling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were in such good spirits when we set out,&rdquo; said Lousteau; &ldquo;now you
      are overdone, and you speak to me so bitterly&mdash;why? Are you not
      accustomed to being told how handsome and how clever you are? For my part,
      I say boldly, before Gatien, I give up Paris; I mean to stay at Sancerre
      and swell the number of your <i>cavalieri serventi</i>. I feel so young
      again in my native district; I have quite forgotten Paris and all its
      wickedness, and its bores, and its wearisome pleasures.&mdash;Yes, my life
      seems in a way purified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah allowed Lousteau to talk without even looking at him; but at last
      there was a moment when this serpent&rsquo;s rhodomontade was really so inspired
      by the effort he made to affect passion in phrases and ideas of which the
      meaning, though hidden from Gatien, found a loud response in Dinah&rsquo;s
      heart, that she raised her eyes to his. This look seemed to crown
      Lousteau&rsquo;s joy; his wit flowed more freely, and at last he made Madame de
      la Baudraye laugh. When, under circumstances which so seriously compromise
      her pride, a woman has been made to laugh, she is finally committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove in by the spacious graveled forecourt, with its lawn in the
      middle, and the large vases filled with flowers which so well set off the
      facade of Anzy, the journalist was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When women love, they forgive everything, even our crimes; when they do
      not love, they cannot forgive anything&mdash;not even our virtues.&mdash;Do
      you forgive me,&rdquo; he added in Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s ear, and pressing her
      arm to his heart with tender emphasis. And Dinah could not help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through dinner, and for the rest of the evening, Etienne was in the
      most delightful spirits, inexhaustibly cheerful; but while thus giving
      vent to his intoxication, he now and then fell into the dreamy abstraction
      of a man who seems rapt in his own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee had been served, Madame de la Baudraye and her mother left
      the men to wander about the gardens. Monsieur Gravier then remarked to
      Monsieur de Clagny:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you observe that Madame de la Baudraye, after going out in a muslin
      gown came home in a velvet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As she got into the carriage at Cosne, the muslin dress caught on a brass
      nail and was torn all the way down,&rdquo; replied Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Gatien, stricken to the heart by hearing two such
      different explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist, who understood, took Gatien by the arm and pressed it as a
      hint to him to be silent. A few minutes later Etienne left Dinah&rsquo;s three
      adorers and took possession of little La Baudraye. Then Gatien was
      cross-questioned as to the events of the day. Monsieur Gravier and
      Monsieur de Clagny were dismayed to hear that on the return from Cosne
      Lousteau had been alone with Dinah, and even more so on hearing the two
      versions explaining the lady&rsquo;s change of dress. And the three discomfited
      gentlemen were in a very awkward position for the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day each, on various business, was obliged to leave Anzy; Dinah
      remained with her mother, Lousteau, and her husband. The annoyance vented
      by the three victims gave rise to an organized rebellion in Sancerre. The
      surrender of the Muse of Le Berry, of the Nivernais, and of Morvan was the
      cause of a perfect hue and cry of slander, evil report, and various
      guesses in which the story of the muslin gown held a prominent place. No
      dress Dinah had ever worn had been so much commented on, or was half as
      interesting to the girls, who could not conceive what the connection might
      be, that made the married women laugh, between love and a muslin gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presidente Boirouge, furious at her son&rsquo;s discomfiture, forgot the
      praise she had lavished on the poem of <i>Paquita</i>, and fulminated
      terrific condemnation on the woman who could publish such a disgraceful
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretched woman commits every crime she writes about,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;Perhaps she will come to the same end as her heroine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah&rsquo;s fate among the good folks of Sancerre was like that of Marechal
      Soult in the opposition newspapers; as long as he is minister he lost the
      battle of Toulouse; whenever he is out of the Government he won it! While
      she was virtuous, Dinah was a match for Camille de Maupin, a rival of the
      most famous women; but as soon as she was happy, she was an <i>unhappy
      creature</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny was her valiant champion; he went several times to the
      Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy to acquire the right to contradict the rumors current as to
      the woman he still faithfully adored, even in her fall; and he maintained
      that she and Lousteau were engaged together on some great work. But the
      lawyer was laughed to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of October was lovely; autumn is the finest season in the valley
      of the Loire; but in 1836 it was unusually glorious. Nature seemed to aid
      and abet Dinah, who, as Bianchon had predicted, gradually developed a
      heart-felt passion. In one month she was an altered woman. She was
      surprised to find in herself so many inert and dormant qualities, hitherto
      in abeyance. To her Lousteau seemed an angel; for heart-love, the crowning
      need of a great nature, had made a new woman of her. Dinah was alive! She
      had found an outlet for her powers, she saw undreamed-of vistas in the
      future&mdash;in short, she was happy, happy without alarms or hindrances.
      The vast castle, the gardens, the park, the forest, favored love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau found in Madame de la Baudraye an artlessness, nay, if you will,
      an innocence of mind which made her very original; there was much more of
      the unexpected and winning in her than in a girl. Lousteau was quite alive
      to a form of flattery which in most women is assumed, but which in Dinah
      was genuine; she really learned from him the ways of love; he really was
      the first to reign in her heart. And, indeed, he took the trouble to be
      exceedingly amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men, like women, have a stock in hand of recitatives, of <i>cantabile</i>,
      of <i>nocturnes</i>, airs and refrains&mdash;shall we say of recipes,
      although we speak of love&mdash;which each one believes to be exclusively
      his own. Men who have reached Lousteau&rsquo;s age try to distribute the
      &ldquo;movements&rdquo; of this repertoire through the whole opera of a passion.
      Lousteau, regarding this adventure with Dinah as a mere temporary
      connection, was eager to stamp himself on her memory in indelible lines;
      and during that beautiful October he was prodigal of his most entrancing
      melodies and most elaborate <i>barcarolles</i>. In fact, he exhausted
      every resource of the stage management of love, to use an expression
      borrowed from the theatrical dictionary, and admirably descriptive of his
      manoeuvres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that woman ever forgets me!&rdquo; he would sometimes say to himself as they
      returned together from a long walk in the woods, &ldquo;I will owe her no grudge&mdash;she
      will have found something better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When two beings have sung together all the duets of that enchanting score,
      and still love each other, it may be said that they love truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, however, had not time to repeat himself, for he was to leave
      Anzy in the early days of November. His paper required his presence in
      Paris. Before breakfast, on the day before he was to leave, the journalist
      and Dinah saw the master of the house come in with an artist from Nevers,
      who restored carvings of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Lousteau. &ldquo;What is to be done to the
      chateau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I am going to do,&rdquo; said the little man, leading Lousteau,
      the local artist, and Dinah out on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out, on the front of the building, a shield supported by two
      sirens, not unlike that which may be seen on the arcade, now closed,
      through which there used to be a passage from the Quai des Tuileries to
      the courtyard of the old Louvre, and over which the words may still be
      seen, &ldquo;<i>Bibliotheque du Cabinet du Roi</i>.&rdquo; This shield bore the arms
      of the noble House of Uxelles, namely, Or and gules party per fess, with
      two lions or, dexter and sinister as supporters. Above, a knight&rsquo;s helm,
      mantled of the tincture of the shield, and surmounted by a ducal coronet.
      Motto, <i>Cy paroist!</i> A proud and sonorous device.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to put my own coat of arms in the place of that of the Uxelles;
      and as they are repeated six times on the two fronts and the two wings, it
      is not a trifling affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arms, so new, and since 1830!&rdquo; exclaimed Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not created an entail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could understand it if you had children,&rdquo; said the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye is still young; there is no
      time lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This allusion made Lousteau smile; he did not understand Monsieur de la
      Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Didine!&rdquo; said he in Dinah&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;what a waste of remorse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah begged him to give her one day more, and the lovers parted after the
      manner of certain theatres, which give ten last performances of a piece
      that is paying. And how many promises they made! How many solemn pledges
      did not Dinah exact and the unblushing journalist give her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, with superiority of the Superior Woman, accompanied Lousteau, in
      the face of all the world, as far as Cosne, with her mother and little La
      Baudraye. When, ten days later, Madame de la Baudraye saw in her
      drawing-room at La Baudraye, Monsieur de Clagny, Gatien, and Gravier, she
      found an opportunity of saying to each in turn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe it to Monsieur Lousteau that I discovered that I had not been loved
      for my own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And what noble speeches she uttered, on man, on the nature of his
      feelings, on the end of his base passions, and so forth. Of Dinah&rsquo;s three
      worshipers, Monsieur de Clagny only said to her: &ldquo;I love you, come what
      may&rdquo;&mdash;and Dinah accepted him as her confidant, lavished on him all
      the marks of friendship which women can devise for the Gurths who are
      ready thus to wear the collar of gilded slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris once more, Lousteau had, in a few weeks, lost the impression of
      the happy time he had spent at the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy. This is why: Lousteau
      lived by his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this century, especially since the triumph of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>&mdash;the
      commonplace, money-saving citizen&mdash;who takes good care not to imitate
      Francis I. or Louis XIV.&mdash;to live by the pen is a form of penal
      servitude to which a galley-slave would prefer death. To live by the pen
      means to create&mdash;to create to-day, and to-morrow, and incessantly&mdash;or
      to seem to create; and the imitation costs as dear as the reality. So,
      besides his daily contribution to a newspaper, which was like the stone of
      Sisyphus, and which came every Monday, crashing down on to the feather of
      his pen, Etienne worked for three or four literary magazines. Still, do
      not be alarmed; he put no artistic conscientiousness into his work. This
      man of Sancerre had a facility, a carelessness, if you call it so, which
      ranked him with those writers who are mere scriveners, literary hacks. In
      Paris, in our day, hack-work cuts a man off from every pretension to a
      literary position. When he can do no more, or no longer cares for
      advancement, the man who can write becomes a journalist and a hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life he leads is not unpleasing. Blue-stockings, beginners in every
      walk of life, actresses at the outset or the close of a career, publishers
      and authors, all make much of these writers of the ready pen. Lousteau, a
      thorough man about town, lived at scarcely any expense beyond paying his
      rent. He had boxes at all the theatres; the sale of the books he reviewed
      or left unreviewed paid for his gloves; and he would say to those authors
      who published at their own expense, &ldquo;I have your book always in my hands!&rdquo;
       He took toll from vanity in the form of drawings or pictures. Every day
      had its engagements to dinner, every night its theatre, every morning was
      filled up with callers, visits, and lounging. His serial in the paper, two
      novels a year for weekly magazines, and his miscellaneous articles were
      the tax he paid for this easy-going life. And yet, to reach this position,
      Etienne had struggled for ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present time, known to the literary world, liked for the good or
      the mischief he did with equally facile good humor, he let himself float
      with the stream, never caring for the future. He ruled a little set of
      newcomers, he had friendships&mdash;or rather, habits of fifteen years&rsquo; 
      standing, and men with whom he supped, and dined, and indulged his wit. He
      earned from seven to eight hundred francs a month, a sum which he found
      quite insufficient for the prodigality peculiar to the impecunious.
      Indeed, Lousteau found himself now just as hard up as when, on first
      appearing in Paris, he had said to himself, &ldquo;If I had but five hundred
      francs a month, I should be rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cause of this phenomenon was as follows: Lousteau lived in the Rue des
      Martyrs in pretty ground-floor rooms with a garden, and splendidly
      furnished. When he settled there in 1833 he had come to an agreement with
      an upholsterer that kept his pocket money low for a long time. These rooms
      were let for twelve hundred francs. The months of January, April, July,
      and October were, as he phrased it, his indigent months. The rent and the
      porter&rsquo;s account cleaned him out. Lousteau took no fewer hackney cabs,
      spend a hundred francs in breakfasts all the same, smoked thirty francs&rsquo; 
      worth of cigars, and could never refuse the mistress of a day a dinner or
      a new dress. He thus dipped so deeply into the fluctuating earnings of the
      following months, that he could no more find a hundred francs on his
      chimney-piece now, when he was making seven or eight hundred francs a
      month, than he could in 1822, when he was hardly getting two hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired, sometimes, by the incessant vicissitudes of a literary life, and as
      much bored by amusement as a courtesan, Lousteau would get out of the
      tideway and sit on the bank, and say to one and another of his intimate
      allies&mdash;Nathan or Bixiou, as they sat smoking in his scrap of garden,
      looking out on an evergreen lawn as big as a dinner-table:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the end of us? White hairs are giving us respectful hints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! we shall marry when we choose to give as much thought to the matter
      as we give to a drama or a novel,&rdquo; said Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Florine?&rdquo; retorted Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all have a Florine,&rdquo; said Etienne, flinging away the end of his
      cigar and thinking of Madame Schontz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Schontz was a pretty enough woman to put a very high price on the
      interest on her beauty, while reserving absolute ownership for Lousteau,
      the man of her heart. Like all those women who get the name in Paris of <i>Lorettes</i>,
      from the Church of Notre Dame de Lorette, round about which they dwell,
      she lived in the Rue Flechier, a stone&rsquo;s throw from Lousteau. This lady
      took a pride and delight in teasing her friends by boasting of having a
      Wit for her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      These details of Lousteau&rsquo;s life and fortune are indispensable, for this
      penury and this bohemian existence of a man to whom Parisian luxury had
      become a necessity, were fated to have a cruel influence on Dinah&rsquo;s life.
      Those to whom the bohemia of Paris is familiar will now understand how it
      was that, by the end of a fortnight, the journalist, up to his ears in the
      literary environment, could laugh about his Baroness with his friends and
      even with Madame Schontz. To such readers as regard such things as utterly
      mean, it is almost useless to make excuses which they will not accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do at Sancerre?&rdquo; asked Bixiou the first time he met
      Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did good service to three worthy provincials&mdash;a Receiver-General
      of Taxes, a little cousin of his, and a Public Prosecutor, who for ten
      years had been dancing round and round one of the hundred &lsquo;Tenth Muses&rsquo; 
      who adorn the Departments,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But they had no more dared to touch
      her than we touch a decorated cream at dessert till some strong-minded
      person has made a hole in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;I said you had gone to Sancerre to turn Pegasus
      out to grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your joke is as stupid as my Muse is handsome,&rdquo; retorted Lousteau. &ldquo;Ask
      Bianchon, my dear fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Muse and a Poet! A homoeopathic cure then!&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tenth day Lousteau received a letter with the Sancerre post-mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! very good!&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Beloved friend, idol of my heart and soul&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; twenty pages of
      it! all at one sitting, and dated midnight! She writes when she finds
      herself alone. Poor woman! Ah, ha! And a postscript&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I dare not ask you to write to me as I write, every day; still, I hope
      to have a few lines from my dear one every week, to relieve my mind.&rsquo;&mdash;What
      a pity to burn it all! it is really well written,&rdquo; said Lousteau to
      himself, as he threw the ten sheets of paper into the fire after having
      read them. &ldquo;That woman was born to reel off copy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau was not much afraid of Madame Schontz, who really loved him for
      himself, but he had supplanted a friend in the heart of a Marquise. This
      Marquise, a lady nowise coy, sometimes dropped in unexpectedly at his
      rooms in the evening, arriving veiled in a hackney coach; and she, as a
      literary woman, allowed herself to hunt through all his drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, Lousteau, who hardly remembered Dinah, was startled by
      another budget from Sancerre&mdash;eight leaves, sixteen pages! He heard a
      woman&rsquo;s step; he thought it announced a search from the Marquise, and
      tossed these rapturous and entrancing proofs of affections into the fire&mdash;unread!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s letter!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Schontz, as she came in. &ldquo;The paper,
      the wax, are scented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, sir,&rdquo; said a porter from the coach office, setting down two
      huge hampers in the ante-room. &ldquo;Carriage paid. Please to sign my book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carriage paid!&rdquo; cried Madame Schontz. &ldquo;It must have come from Sancerre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Tenth Muse is a remarkably intelligent woman,&rdquo; said the courtesan,
      opening one of the hampers, while Lousteau was writing his name. &ldquo;I like a
      Muse who understands housekeeping, and who can make game pies as well as
      blots. And, oh! what beautiful flowers!&rdquo; she went on, opening the second
      hamper. &ldquo;Why, you could get none finer in Paris!&mdash;And here, and here!
      A hare, partridges, half a roebuck!&mdash;We will ask your friends and
      have a famous dinner, for Athalie has a special talent for dressing
      venison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau wrote to Dinah; but instead of writing from the heart, he was
      clever. The letter was all the more insidious; it was like one of
      Mirabeau&rsquo;s letters to Sophie. The style of a true lover is transparent. It
      is a clear stream which allows the bottom of the heart to be seen between
      two banks, bright with the trifles of existence, and covered with the
      flowers of the soul that blossom afresh every day, full of intoxicating
      beauty&mdash;but only for two beings. As soon as a love letter has any
      charm for a third reader, it is beyond doubt the product of the head, not
      of the heart. But a woman will always be beguiled; she always believes
      herself to be the determining cause of this flow of wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of December Lousteau had ceased to read Dinah&rsquo;s letters; they
      lay in a heap in a drawer of his chest that was never locked, under his
      shirts, which they scented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one of those chances came to Lousteau which such bohemians ought to
      clutch by every hair. In the middle of December, Madame Schontz, who took
      a real interest in Etienne, sent to beg him to call on her one morning on
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you have a chance of marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can marry very often, happily, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I say marrying, I mean marrying well. You have no prejudices: I need
      not mince matters. This is the position: A young lady has got into
      trouble; her mother knows nothing of even a kiss. Her father is an honest
      notary, a man of honor; he has been wise enough to keep it dark. He wants
      to get his daughter married within a fortnight, and he will give her a
      fortune of a hundred and fifty thousand francs&mdash;for he has three
      other children; but&mdash;and it is not a bad idea&mdash;he will add a
      hundred thousand francs, under the rose, hand to hand, to cover the
      damages. They are an old family of Paris citizens, Rue des Lombards&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why does not the lover marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a romance! Such things are nowhere to be heard of but in the Rue des
      Lombards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not take it into your head that a jealous brother murdered the
      seducer. The young man died in the most commonplace way of a pleurisy
      caught as he came out of the theatre. A head-clerk and penniless, the man
      entrapped the daughter in order to marry into the business&mdash;A
      judgment from heaven, I call it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you hear the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Malaga; the notary is her <i>milord</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Cardot, the son of that little old man in hair-powder, Florentine&rsquo;s
      first friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Malaga, whose &lsquo;fancy&rsquo; is a little tomtit of a fiddler of
      eighteen, cannot in conscience make such a boy marry the girl. Besides,
      she has no cause to do him an ill turn.&mdash;Indeed, Monsieur Cardot
      wants a man of thirty at least. Our notary, I feel sure, will be proud to
      have a famous man for his son-in-law. So just feel yourself all over.&mdash;You
      will pay your debts, you will have twelve thousand francs a year, and be a
      father without any trouble on your part; what do you say to that to the
      good? And, after all, you only marry a very consolable widow. There is an
      income of fifty thousand francs in the house, and the value of the
      connection, so in due time you may look forward to not less than fifteen
      thousand francs a year more for your share, and you will enter a family
      holding a fine political position; Cardot is the brother-in-law of old
      Camusot, the depute who lived so long with Fanny Beaupre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lousteau, &ldquo;old Camusot married little Daddy Cardot&rsquo;s eldest
      daughter, and they had high times together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Madame Schontz went on, &ldquo;and Madame Cardot, the notary&rsquo;s wife, was
      a Chiffreville&mdash;manufacturers of chemical products, the aristocracy
      of these days! Potash, I tell you! Still, this is the unpleasant side of
      the matter. You will have a terrible mother-in-law, a woman capable of
      killing her daughter if she knew&mdash;! This Cardot woman is a bigot; she
      has lips like two faded narrow pink ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of the town like you would never pass muster with that woman, who,
      in her well-meaning way, will spy out your bachelor life and know every
      fact of the past. However, Cardot says he means to exert his paternal
      authority. The poor man will be obliged to do the civil to his wife for
      some days; a woman made of wood, my dear fellow; Malaga, who has seen her,
      calls her a penitential scrubber. Cardot is a man of forty; he will be
      mayor of his district, and perhaps be elected deputy. He is prepared to
      give in lieu of the hundred thousand francs a nice little house in the Rue
      Saint-Lazare, with a forecourt and a garden, which cost him no more than
      sixty thousand at the time of the July overthrow; he would sell, and that
      would be an opportunity for you to go and come at the house, to see the
      daughter, and be civil to the mother.&mdash;And it would give you a look
      of property in Madame Cardot&rsquo;s eyes. You would be housed like a prince in
      that little mansion. Then, by Camusot&rsquo;s interest, you may get an
      appointment as librarian to some public office where there is no library.&mdash;Well,
      and then if you invest your money in backing up a newspaper, you will get
      ten thousand francs a year on it, you can earn six, your librarianship
      will bring you in four.&mdash;Can you do better for yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to marry a lamb without spot, it might be a light woman by
      the end of two years. What is the damage?&mdash;an anticipated dividend!
      It is quite the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my word for it, you can do no better than come to dine with Malaga
      to-morrow. You will meet your father-in-law; he will know the secret has
      been let out&mdash;by Malaga, with whom he cannot be angry&mdash;and then
      you are master of the situation. As to your wife!&mdash;Why her misconduct
      leaves you as free as a bachelor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your language is as blunt as a cannon ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you for your own sake, that is all&mdash;and I can reason. Well!
      why do you stand there like a wax image of Abd-el-Kader? There is nothing
      to meditate over. Marriage is heads or tails&mdash;well, you have tossed
      heads up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have my reply to-morrow,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would sooner have it at once; Malaga will write you up to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau spent the evening in writing a long letter to the Marquise,
      giving her the reasons which compelled him to marry; his constant poverty,
      the torpor of his imagination, his white hairs, his moral and physical
      exhaustion&mdash;in short, four pages of arguments.&mdash;&ldquo;As to Dinah, I
      will send her a circular announcing the marriage,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;As
      Bixiou says, I have not my match for knowing how to dock the tail of a
      passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, who at first had been on some ceremony with himself, by next day
      had come to the point of dreading lest the marriage should not come off.
      He was pressingly civil to the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew monsieur your father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at Florentine&rsquo;s, so I may well
      know you here, at Mademoiselle Turquet&rsquo;s. Like father, like son. A very
      good fellow and a philosopher, was little Daddy Cardot&mdash;excuse me, we
      always called him so. At that time, Florine, Florentine, Tullia, Coralie,
      and Mariette were the five fingers of your hand, so to speak&mdash;it is
      fifteen years ago. My follies, as you may suppose, are a thing of the
      past.&mdash;In those days it was pleasure that ran away with me; now I am
      ambitious; but, in our day, to get on at all a man must be free from debt,
      have a good income, a wife, and a family. If I pay taxes enough to qualify
      me, I may be a deputy yet, like any other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maitre Cardot appreciated this profession of faith. Lousteau had laid
      himself out to please and the notary liked him, feeling himself more at
      his ease, as may be easily imagined, with a man who had known his father&rsquo;s
      secrets than he would have been with another. On the following day
      Lousteau was introduced to the Cardot family as the purchaser of the house
      in the Rue Saint-Lazare, and three days later he dined there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardot lived in an old house near the Place du Chatelet. In this house
      everything was &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Economy covered every scrap of gilding with green
      gauze; all the furniture wore holland covers. Though it was impossible to
      feel a shade of uneasiness as to the wealth of the inhabitants, at the end
      of half an hour no one could suppress a yawn. Boredom perched in every
      nook; the curtains hung dolefully; the dining-room was like Harpagon&rsquo;s.
      Even if Lousteau had not known all about Malaga, he could have guessed
      that the notary&rsquo;s real life was spent elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist saw a tall, fair girl with blue eyes, at once shy and
      languishing. The elder brother took a fancy to him; he was the fourth
      clerk in the office, but strongly attracted by the snares of literary
      fame, though destined to succeed his father. The younger sister was twelve
      years old. Lousteau, assuming a little Jesuitical air, played the
      Monarchist and Churchman for the benefit of the mother, was quite smooth,
      deliberate, and complimentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within three weeks of their introduction, at his fourth dinner there,
      Felicie Cardot, who had been watching Lousteau out of the corner of her
      eye, carried him a cup of coffee where he stood in the window recess, and
      said in a low voice, with tears in her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will devote my whole life, monsieur, to thanking you for your sacrifice
      in favor of a poor girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau was touched; there was so much expression in her look, her
      accent, her attitude. &ldquo;She would make a good man happy,&rdquo; thought he,
      pressing her hand in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Cardot looked upon her son-in-law as a man with a future before
      him; but, above all the fine qualities she ascribed to him, she was most
      delighted by his high tone of morals. Etienne, prompted by the wily
      notary, had pledged his word that he had no natural children, no tie that
      could endanger the happiness of her dear Felicie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may perhaps think I go rather too far,&rdquo; said the bigot to the
      journalist; &ldquo;but in giving such a jewel as my Felicie to any man, one must
      think of the future. I am not one of those mothers who want to be rid of
      their daughters. Monsieur Cardot hurries matters on, urges forward his
      daughter&rsquo;s marriage; he wishes it over. This is the only point on which we
      differ.&mdash;Though with a man like you, monsieur, a literary man whose
      youth has been preserved by hard work from the moral shipwreck now so
      prevalent, we may feel quite safe; still, you would be the first to laugh
      at me if I looked for a husband for my daughter with my eyes shut. I know
      you are not an innocent, and I should be very sorry for my Felicie if you
      were&rdquo; (this was said in a whisper); &ldquo;but if you had any <i>liaison</i>&mdash;For
      instance, monsieur, you have heard of Madame Roguin, the wife of a notary
      who, unhappily for our faculty, was sadly notorious. Madame Roguin has,
      ever since 1820, been kept by a banker&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, du Tillet,&rdquo; replied Etienne; but he bit his tongue as he recollected
      how rash it was to confess to an acquaintance with du Tillet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;Well, monsieur, if you were a mother, would you not quake at
      the thought that Madame du Tillet&rsquo;s fate might be your child&rsquo;s? At her
      age, and <i>nee</i> de Granville! To have as a rival a woman of fifty and
      more. Sooner would I see my daughter dead than give her to a man who had
      such a connection with a married woman. A grisette, an actress, you take
      her and leave her.&mdash;There is no danger, in my opinion, from women of
      that stamp; love is their trade, they care for no one, one down and
      another to come on!&mdash;But a woman who has sinned against duty must hug
      her sin, her only excuse is constancy, if such a crime can ever have an
      excuse. At least, that is the view I hold of a respectable woman&rsquo;s fall,
      and that is what makes it so terrible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of looking for the meaning of these speeches, Etienne made a jest
      of them at Malaga&rsquo;s, whither he went with his father-in-law elect; for the
      notary and the journalist were the best of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau had already given himself the airs of a person of importance; his
      life at last was to have a purpose; he was in luck&rsquo;s way, and in a few
      days would be the owner of a delightful little house in the Rue
      Saint-Lazare; he was going to be married to a charming woman, he would
      have about twenty thousand francs a year, and could give the reins to his
      ambition; the young lady loved him, and he would be connected with several
      respectable families. In short, he was in full sail on the blue waters of
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Cardot had expressed a wish to see the prints for <i>Gil Blas</i>,
      one of the illustrated volumes which the French publishers were at that
      time bringing out, and Lousteau had taken the first numbers for the lady&rsquo;s
      inspection. The lawyer&rsquo;s wife had a scheme of her own, she had borrowed
      the book merely to return it; she wanted an excuse for walking in on her
      future son-in-law quite unexpectedly. The sight of those bachelor rooms,
      which her husband had described as charming, would tell her more, she
      thought, as to Lousteau&rsquo;s habits of life than any information she could
      pick up. Her sister-in-law, Madame Camusot, who knew nothing of the
      fateful secret, was terrified at such a marriage for her niece. Monsieur
      Camusot, a Councillor of the Supreme Court, old Camusot&rsquo;s son by his first
      marriage, had given his step-mother, who was Cardot&rsquo;s sister, a far from
      flattering account of the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, clever as he was, did not think it strange that the wife of a
      rich notary should wish to inspect a volume costing fifteen francs before
      deciding on the purchase. Your clever man never condescends to study the
      middle-class, who escape his ken by this want of attention; and while he
      is making game of them, they are at leisure to throttle him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day early in January 1837, Madame Cardot and her daughter took a
      hackney coach and went to the Rue des Martyrs to return the parts of <i>Gil
      Blas</i> to Felicie&rsquo;s betrothed, both delighted at the thought of seeing
      Lousteau&rsquo;s rooms. These domiciliary visitations are not unusual in the old
      citizen class. The porter at the front gate was not in; but his daughter,
      on being informed by the worthy lady that she was in the presence of
      Monsieur Lousteau&rsquo;s future mother-in-law and bride, handed over the key of
      the apartment&mdash;all the more readily because Madame Cardot placed a
      gold piece in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by this time about noon, the hour at which the journalist would
      return from breakfasting at the Cafe Anglais. As he crossed the open space
      between the Church of Notre-Dame de Lorette and the Rue des Martyrs,
      Lousteau happened to look at a hired coach that was toiling up the Rue du
      Faubourg-Montmartre, and he fancied it was a dream when he saw the face of
      Dinah! He stood frozen to the spot when, on reaching his house, he beheld
      his Didine at the coach door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has brought you here?&rdquo; he inquired.&mdash;He adopted the familiar <i>tu</i>.
      The formality of <i>vous</i> was out of the question to a woman he must
      get rid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my love,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;have you not read my letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I have,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a father,&rdquo; replied the country lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; cried he, disregarding the barbarity of such an exclamation.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;she must be prepared for the blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He signed to the coachman to wait, gave his hand to Madame de la Baudraye,
      and left the man with the chaise full of trunks, vowing that he would send
      away <i>illico</i>, as he said to himself, the woman and her luggage, back
      to the place she had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur,&rdquo; called out little Pamela.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child had some sense, and felt that three women must not be allowed to
      meet in a bachelor&rsquo;s rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Lousteau, dragging Dinah along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pamela concluded that the lady must be some relation; however, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The key is in the door; your mother-in-law is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his agitation, while Madame de la Baudraye was pouring out a flood of
      words, Etienne understood the child to say, &ldquo;Mother is there,&rdquo; the only
      circumstance that suggested itself as possible, and he went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felicie and her mother, who were by this time in the bed-room, crept into
      a corner on seeing Etienne enter with a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, Etienne, my dearest, I am yours for life!&rdquo; cried Dinah, throwing
      her arms round his neck, and clasping him closely, while he took the key
      from the outside of the door. &ldquo;Life is a perpetual anguish to me in that
      house at Anzy. I could bear it no longer; and when the time came for me to
      proclaim my happiness&mdash;well, I had not the courage.&mdash;Here I am,
      your wife with your child! And you have not written to me; you have left
      me two months without a line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dinah, you place me in the greatest difficulty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I do otherwise than love you?&mdash;But would you not have been
      wiser to remain at Sancerre?&mdash;I am in the most abject poverty, and I
      fear to drag you into it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your misery will be paradise to me. I only ask to live here, never to go
      out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! that is all very fine in words, but&mdash;&rdquo; Dinah sat down and
      melted into tears as she heard this speech, roughly spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau could not resist this distress. He clasped the Baroness in his
      arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cry, Didine!&rdquo; said he; and, as he uttered the words, he saw in the
      mirror the figure of Madame Cardot, looking at him from the further end of
      the rooms. &ldquo;Come, Didine, go with Pamela and get your trunks unloaded,&rdquo;
       said he in her ear. &ldquo;Go; do not cry; we will be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led her to the door, and then came back to divert the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame Cardot, &ldquo;I congratulate myself on having resolved
      to see for myself the home of the man who was to have been my son-in-law.
      If my daughter were to die of it, she should never be the wife of such a
      man as you. You must devote yourself to making your Didine happy,
      monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the virtuous lady walked out, followed by Felicie, who was crying too,
      for she had become accustomed to Etienne. The dreadful Madame Cardot got
      into her hackney-coach again, staring insolently at the hapless Dinah, in
      whose heart the sting still rankled of &ldquo;that is all very fine in words&rdquo;;
      but who, nevertheless, like every woman in love, believed in the murmured,
      &ldquo;Do not cry, Didine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, who was not lacking in the sort of decision which grows out of
      the vicissitudes of a storm-tossed life, reflected thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didine is high-minded; when once she knows of my proposed marriage, she
      will sacrifice herself for my future prospects, and I know how I can
      manage to let her know.&rdquo; Delighted at having hit on a trick of which the
      success seemed certain, he danced round to a familiar tune:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Larifla, fla, fla!</i>&mdash;And Didine once out of the way,&rdquo; he went
      on, talking to himself, &ldquo;I will treat Maman Cardot to a call and a
      novelette: I have seduced her Felicie at Saint-Eustache&mdash;Felicie,
      guilty through passion, bears in her bosom the pledge of our affection&mdash;and
      <i>larifla, fla, fla!</i> the father <i>Ergo</i>, the notary, his wife,
      and his daughter are caught, nabbed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, to her great amazement, Dinah discovered Etienne performing a
      prohibited dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arrival and our happiness have turned my head with joy,&rdquo; said he, to
      explain this crazy mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had fancied you had ceased to love me!&rdquo; exclaimed the poor woman,
      dropping the handbag she was carrying, and weeping with joy as she sank
      into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself at home, my darling,&rdquo; said Etienne, laughing in his sleeve;
      &ldquo;I must write two lines to excuse myself from a bachelor party, for I mean
      to devote myself to you. Give your orders; you are at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne wrote to Bixiou:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;MY DEAR BOY,&mdash;My Baroness has dropped into my arms, and will be
  fatal to my marriage unless we perform one of the most familiar
  stratagems of the thousand and one comedies at the Gymnase. I rely
  on you to come here, like one of Moliere&rsquo;s old men, to scold your
  nephew Leandre for his folly, while the Tenth Muse lies hidden in
  my bedroom; you must work on her feelings; strike hard, be brutal,
  offensive. I, you understand, shall express my blind devotion, and
  shall seem to be deaf, so that you may have to shout at me.

  &ldquo;Come, if you can, at seven o&rsquo;clock.

  &ldquo;Yours,

  &ldquo;E. LOUSTEAU.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Having sent this letter by a commissionaire to the man who, in all Paris,
      most delighted in such practical jokes&mdash;in the slang of artists, a <i>&ldquo;charge&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Lousteau
      made a great show of settling the Muse of Sancerre in his apartment. He
      busied himself in arranging the luggage she had brought, and informed her
      as to the persons and ways of the house with such perfect good faith, and
      a glee which overflowed in kind words and caresses, that Dinah believed
      herself the best-beloved woman in the world. These rooms, where everything
      bore the stamp of fashion, pleased her far better than her old chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pamela Migeon, the intelligent damsel of fourteen, was questioned by the
      journalist as to whether she would like to be waiting-maid to the imposing
      Baroness. Pamela, perfectly enchanted, entered on her duties at once, by
      going off to order dinner from a restaurant on the boulevard. Dinah was
      able to judge of the extreme poverty that lay hidden under the purely
      superficial elegance of this bachelor home when she found none of the
      necessaries of life. As she took possession of the closets and drawers,
      she indulged in the fondest dreams; she would alter Etienne&rsquo;s habits, she
      would make him home-keeping, she would fill his cup of domestic happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novelty of the position hid its disastrous side; Dinah regarded
      reciprocated love as the absolution of her sin; she did not yet look
      beyond the walls of these rooms. Pamela, whose wits were as sharp as those
      of a <i>lorette</i>, went straight to Madame Schontz to beg the loan of
      some plate, telling her what had happened to Lousteau. After making the
      child welcome to all she had, Madame Schontz went off to her friend
      Malaga, that Cardot might be warned of the catastrophe that had befallen
      his future son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist, not in the least uneasy about the crisis as affecting his
      marriage, was more and more charming to the lady from the provinces. The
      dinner was the occasion of the delightful child&rsquo;s-play of lovers set at
      liberty, and happy to be free. When they had had their coffee, and
      Lousteau was sitting in front of the fire, Dinah on his knee, Pamela ran
      in with a scared face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Monsieur Bixiou!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the bedroom,&rdquo; said the journalist to his mistress; &ldquo;I will soon
      get rid of him. He is one of my most intimate friends, and I shall have to
      explain to him my new start in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ho! dinner for two, and a blue velvet bonnet!&rdquo; cried Bixiou. &ldquo;I am
      off.&mdash;Ah! that is what comes of marrying&mdash;one must go through
      some partings. How rich one feels when one begins to move one&rsquo;s sticks,
      heh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who talks of marrying?&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you not going to be married, then?&rdquo; cried Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? My word, what next? Are you making a fool of yourself, if you please?&mdash;What!&mdash;You,
      who, by the mercy of Heaven, have come across twenty thousand francs a
      year, and a house, and a wife connected with all the first families of the
      better middle class&mdash;a wife, in short, out of the Rue des Lombards&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Bixiou, enough; it is at an end. Be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be off? I have a friend&rsquo;s privileges, and I shall take every advantage of
      them.&mdash;What has come over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has &lsquo;come over&rsquo; me is my lady from Sancerre. She is a mother, and we
      are going to live together happily to the end of our days.&mdash;You would
      have heard it to-morrow, so you may as well be told it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many chimney-pots are falling on my head, as Arnal says. But if this
      woman really loves you, my dear fellow, she will go back to the place she
      came from. Did any provincial woman ever yet find her sea-legs in Paris?
      She will wound all your vanities. Have you forgotten what a provincial is?
      She will bore you as much when she is happy as when she is sad; she will
      have as great a talent for escaping grace as a Parisian has in inventing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lousteau, listen to me. That a passion should lead you to forget to some
      extent the times in which we live, is conceivable; but I, my dear fellow,
      have not the mythological bandage over my eyes.&mdash;Well, then consider
      your position. For fifteen years you have been tossing in the literary
      world; you are no longer young, you have padded the hoof till your soles
      are worn through!&mdash;Yes, my boy, you turn your socks under like a
      street urchin to hide the holes, so that the legs cover the heels! In
      short, the joke is too stale. Your excuses are more familiar than a patent
      medicine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may say to you, like the Regent to Cardinal Dubois, &lsquo;That is kicking
      enough!&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lousteau, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, venerable young man,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, &ldquo;the iron has touched the sore
      to the quick. You are worn out, aren&rsquo;t you? Well, then; in the heyday of
      youth, under the pressure of penury, what have you done? You are not in
      the front rank, and you have not a thousand francs of your own. That is
      the sum-total of the situation. Can you, in the decline of your powers,
      support a family by your pen, when your wife, if she is an honest woman,
      will not have at her command the resources of the woman of the streets,
      who can extract her thousand-franc note from the depths where milord keeps
      it safe? You are rushing into the lowest depths of the social theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is only the financial side. Now, consider the political
      position. We are struggling in an essentially <i>bourgeois</i> age, in
      which honor, virtue, high-mindedness, talent, learning&mdash;genius, in
      short, is summed up in paying your way, owing nobody anything, and
      conducting your affairs with judgment. Be steady, be respectable, have a
      wife, and children, pay your rent and taxes, serve in the National Guard,
      and be on the same pattern as all the men of your company&mdash;then you
      may indulge in the loftiest pretensions, rise to the Ministry!&mdash;and
      you have the best chances possible, since you are no Montmorency. You were
      preparing to fulfil all the conditions insisted on for turning out a
      political personage, you are capable of every mean trick that is necessary
      in office, even of pretending to be commonplace&mdash;you would have acted
      it to the life. And just for a woman, who will leave you in the lurch&mdash;the
      end of every eternal passion&mdash;in three, five, or seven years&mdash;after
      exhausting your last physical and intellectual powers, you turn your back
      on the sacred Hearth, on the Rue des Lombards, on a political career, on
      thirty thousand francs per annum, on respectability and respect!&mdash;Ought
      that to be the end of a man who has done with illusions?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had kept a pot boiling for some actress who gave you your fun for
      it&mdash;well; that is what you may call a cabinet matter. But to live
      with another man&rsquo;s wife? It is a draft at sight on disaster; it is bolting
      the bitter pills of vice with none of the gilding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. One word answers it all; I love Madame de la Baudraye, and
      prefer her to every fortune, to every position the world can offer.&mdash;I
      may have been carried away by a gust of ambition, but everything must give
      way to the joy of being a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! you have a fancy for paternity? But, wretched man, we are the
      fathers only of our legitimate children. What is a brat that does not bear
      your name? The last chapter of the romance.&mdash;Your child will be taken
      from you! We have seen that story in twenty plays these ten years past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society, my dear boy, will drop upon you sooner or later. Read <i>Adolphe</i>
      once more.&mdash;Dear me! I fancy I can see you when you and she are used
      to each other;&mdash;I see you dejected, hang-dog, bereft of position and
      fortune, and fighting like the shareholders of a bogus company when they
      are tricked by a director!&mdash;Your director is happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, Bixiou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have only just begun,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;Listen, my dear boy. Marriage
      has been out of favor for some time past; but, apart from the advantages
      it offers in being the only recognized way of certifying heredity, as it
      affords a good-looking young man, though penniless, the opportunity of
      making his fortune in two months, it survives in spite of disadvantages.
      And there is not the man living who would not repent, sooner or later, of
      having, by his own fault, lost the chance of marrying thirty thousand
      francs a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; cried Lousteau, in a voice of exasperation. &ldquo;Go
      away&mdash;she is there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; why did you not tell me sooner?&mdash;You are of age,
      and so is she,&rdquo; he added in a lower voice, but loud enough to be heard by
      Dinah. &ldquo;She will make you repent bitterly of your happiness!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a folly, I intend to commit it.&mdash;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man gone overboard!&rdquo; cried Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take those friends who think they have a right to preach to you,&rdquo;
       said Lousteau, opening the door of the bedroom, where he found Madame de
      la Baudraye sunk in an armchair and dabbing her eyes with an embroidered
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why did I come here?&rdquo; sobbed she. &ldquo;Good Heavens, why indeed?&mdash;Etienne,
      I am not so provincial as you think me.&mdash;You are making a fool of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling angel,&rdquo; replied Lousteau, taking Dinah in his arms, lifting her
      from her chair, and dragging her half dead into the drawing-room, &ldquo;we have
      both pledged our future, it is sacrifice for sacrifice. While I was loving
      you at Sancerre, they were engaging me to be married here, but I refused.&mdash;Oh!
      I was extremely distressed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; cried Dinah, starting wildly to her feet and turning to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay here, my Didine. All is at an end. And is this fortune so
      lightly earned after all? Must I not marry a gawky, tow-haired creature,
      with a red nose, the daughter of a notary, and saddle myself with a
      stepmother who could give Madame de Piedefer points on the score of
      bigotry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pamela flew in, and whispered in Lousteau&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Schontz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau rose, leaving Dinah on the sofa, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over with you, my dear,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Cardot does not mean
      to quarrel with his wife for the sake of a son-in-law. The lady made a
      scene&mdash;something like a scene, I can tell you! So, to conclude, the
      head-clerk, who was the late head-clerk&rsquo;s deputy for two years, agrees to
      take the girl with the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed Lousteau. &ldquo;What! in two hours he has made up his
      mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, that is simple enough. The rascal, who knew all the dead man&rsquo;s
      little secrets, guessed what a fix his master was in from overhearing a
      few words of the squabble with Madame Cardot. The notary relies on your
      honor and good feeling, for the affair is settled. The clerk, whose
      conduct has been admirable, went so far as to attend mass! A finished
      hypocrite, I say&mdash;just suits the mamma. You and Cardot will still be
      friends. He is to be a director in an immense financial concern, and he
      may be of use to you.&mdash;So you have been waked from a sweet dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost a fortune, a wife, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a mistress,&rdquo; said Madame Schontz, smiling. &ldquo;Here you are, more than
      married; you will be insufferable, you will be always wanting to get home,
      there will be nothing loose about you, neither your clothes nor your
      habits. And, after all, my Arthur does things in style. I will be faithful
      to him and cut Malaga&rsquo;s acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me peep at her through the door&mdash;your Sancerre Muse,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;Is there no finer bird than that to be found in the desert?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;You are cheated! She is dignified, lean, lachrymose; she only
      needs Lady Dudley&rsquo;s turban!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; asked Madame de la Baudraye, who had heard the rustle of
      a silk dress and the murmur of a woman&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, my darling, that we are now indissolubly united.&mdash;I have just
      had an answer to the letter you saw me write, which was to break off my
      marriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was the party which you gave up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will be more than your wife&mdash;I am your slave, I give you my
      life,&rdquo; said the poor deluded creature. &ldquo;I did not believe I could love you
      more than I did!&mdash;Now I shall not be a mere incident, but your whole
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my beautiful, my generous Didine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear to me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that only death shall divide us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau was ready to sweeten his vows with the most fascinating
      prettinesses. And this was why. Between the door of the apartment where he
      had taken the lorette&rsquo;s farewell kiss, and that of the drawing-room, where
      the Muse was reclining, bewildered by such a succession of shocks,
      Lousteau had remembered little De la Baudraye&rsquo;s precarious health, his
      fine fortune, and Bianchon&rsquo;s remark about Dinah, &ldquo;She will be a rich
      widow!&rdquo; and he said to himself, &ldquo;I would a hundred times rather have
      Madame de la Baudraye for a wife than Felicie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His plan of action was quickly decided on; he determined to play the farce
      of passion once more, and to perfection. His mean self-interestedness and
      his false vehemence of passion had disastrous results. Madame de la
      Baudraye, when she set out from Sancerre for Paris, had intended to live
      in rooms of her own quite near to Lousteau; but the proofs of devotion her
      lover had given her by giving up such brilliant prospects, and yet more
      the perfect happiness of the first days of their illicit union, kept her
      from mentioning such a parting. The second day was to be&mdash;and indeed
      was&mdash;a high festival, in which such a suggestion proposed to &ldquo;her
      angel&rdquo; would have been a discordant note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, on his part, anxious to make Dinah feel herself dependent on
      him, kept her in a state of constant intoxication by incessant amusement.
      These circumstances hindered two persons so clever as these were from
      avoiding the slough into which they fell&mdash;that of a life in common, a
      piece of folly of which, unfortunately, many instances may be seen in
      Paris in literary circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus was the whole programme played out of a provincial amour, so
      satirically described by Lousteau to Madame de la Baudraye&mdash;a fact
      which neither he nor she remembered. Passion is born a deaf-mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      This winter in Paris was to Madame de la Baudraye all that the month of
      October had been at Sancerre. Etienne, to initiate &ldquo;his wife&rdquo; into Paris
      life, varied this honeymoon by evenings at the play, where Dinah would
      only go to the stage box. At first Madame de la Baudraye preserved some
      remnants of her countrified modesty; she was afraid of being seen; she hid
      her happiness. She would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Clagny or Monsieur Gravier may have followed me to Paris.&rdquo;
       She was afraid on Sancerre even in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau, who was excessively vain, educated Dinah, took her to the best
      dressmakers, and pointed out to her the most fashionable women, advising
      her to take them as models for imitation. And Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s
      provincial appearance was soon a thing of the past. Lousteau, when his
      friends met him, was congratulated on his conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through that season Etienne wrote little and got very much into debt,
      though Dinah, who was proud, bought all her clothes out of her savings,
      and fancied she had not been the smallest expense to her beloved. By the
      end of three months Dinah was acclimatized; she had reveled in the music
      at the Italian opera; she knew the pieces &ldquo;on&rdquo; at all theatres, and the
      actors and jests of the day; she had become inured to this life of
      perpetual excitement, this rapid torrent in which everything is forgotten.
      She no longer craned her neck or stood with her nose in the air, like an
      image of Amazement, at the constant surprises that Paris has for a
      stranger. She had learned to breathe that witty, vitalizing, teeming
      atmosphere where clever people feel themselves in their element, and which
      they can no longer bear to quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as she read the papers, for Lousteau had them all, two lines
      carried her back to Sancerre and the past, two lines that seemed not
      unfamiliar&mdash;as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron de Clagny, Public Prosecutor to the Criminal Court at
      Sancerre, has been appointed Deputy Public Prosecutor to the Supreme Court
      in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well that worthy lawyer loves you!&rdquo; said the journalist, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What did I tell you? He is following me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Etienne and Dinah were just then at the most dazzling and fervid stage of
      a passion when each is perfectly accustomed to the other, and yet love has
      not lost its freshness and relish. The lovers know each other well, but
      all is not yet understood; they have not been a second time to the same
      secret haunts of the soul; they have not studied each other till they
      know, as they must later, the very thought, word, and gesture that
      responds to every event, the greatest and the smallest. Enchantment
      reigns; there are no collisions, no differences of opinion, no cold looks.
      Their two souls are always on the same side. And Dinah would speak the
      magical words, emphasized by the yet more magical expression and looks
      which every woman can use under such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you cease to love me, kill me.&mdash;If you should cease to love me,
      I believe I could kill you first and myself after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this sweet exaggeration, Lousteau would reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask of God is to see you as constant as I shall be. It is you who
      will desert me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love is supreme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supreme,&rdquo; echoed Lousteau. &ldquo;Come, now? Suppose I am dragged away to a
      bachelor party, and find there one of my former mistresses, and she makes
      fun of me; I, out of vanity, behave as if I were free, and do not come in
      here till next morning&mdash;would you still love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman is only sure of being loved when she is preferred; and if you
      came back to me, if&mdash;Oh! you make me understand what the happiness
      would be of forgiving the man I adore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I am truly loved for the first time in my life!&rdquo; cried
      Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last you understand that!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau proposed that they should each write a letter setting forth the
      reasons which would compel them to end by suicide. Once in possession of
      such a document, each might kill the other without danger in case of
      infidelity. But in spite of mutual promises, neither wrote the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist, happy for the moment, promised himself that he would
      deceive Dinah when he should be tired of her, and would sacrifice
      everything to the requirements of that deception. To him Madame de la
      Baudraye was a fortune in herself. At the same time, he felt the yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, by consenting to this union, showed a generous mind and the power
      derived from self-respect. In this absolute intimacy, in which both lovers
      put off their masks, the young woman never abdicated her modesty, her
      masculine rectitude, and the strength peculiar to ambitious souls, which
      formed the basis of her character. Lousteau involuntarily held her in high
      esteem. As a Parisian, Dinah was superior to the most fascinating
      courtesan; she could be as amusing and as witty as Malaga; but her
      extensive information, her habits of mind, her vast reading enabled her to
      generalize her wit, while the Florines and the Schontzes exerted theirs
      over a very narrow circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is in Dinah,&rdquo; said Etienne to Bixiou, &ldquo;the stuff to make both a
      Ninon and a De Stael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman who combines an encyclopaedia and a seraglio is very dangerous,&rdquo;
       replied the mocking spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the expected infant became a visible fact, Madame de la Baudraye
      would be seen no more; but before shutting herself up, never to go out
      unless into the country, she was bent on being present at the first
      performance of a play by Nathan. This literary solemnity occupied the
      minds of the two thousand persons who regard themselves as constituting
      &ldquo;all Paris.&rdquo; Dinah, who had never been at a first night&rsquo;s performance, was
      very full of natural curiosity. She had by this time arrived at such a
      pitch of affection for Lousteau that she gloried in her misconduct; she
      exerted a sort of savage strength to defy the world; she was determined to
      look it in the face without turning her head aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed herself to perfection, in a style suited to her delicate looks
      and the sickly whiteness of her face. Her pallid complexion gave her an
      expression of refinement, and her black hair in smooth bands enhanced her
      pallor. Her brilliant gray eyes looked finer than ever, set in dark rings.
      But a terribly distressing incident awaited her. By a very simple chance,
      the box given to the journalist, on the first tier, was next to that which
      Anna Grossetete had taken. The two intimate friends did not even bow;
      neither chose to acknowledge the other. At the end of the first act
      Lousteau left his seat, abandoning Dinah to the fire of eyes, the glare of
      opera-glasses; while the Baronne de Fontaine and the Comtesse Marie de
      Vandenesse, who accompanied her, received some of the most distinguished
      men of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah&rsquo;s solitude was all the more distressing because she had not the art
      of putting a good face to the matter by examining the company through her
      opera-glass. In vain did she try to assume a dignified and thoughtful
      attitude, and fix her eyes on vacancy; she was overpoweringly conscious of
      being the object of general attention; she could not disguise her
      discomfort, and lapsed a little into provincialism, displaying her
      handkerchief and making involuntary movements of which she had almost
      cured herself. At last, between the second and third acts, a man had
      himself admitted to Dinah&rsquo;s box! It was Monsieur de Clagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy to see you, to tell you how much I am pleased by your
      promotion,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Madame, for whom should I come to Paris&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Have I anything to do with your appointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Since you left Sancerre, it had become intolerable
      to me; I was dying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sincere friendship does me good,&rdquo; replied she, holding out her hand.
      &ldquo;I am in a position to make much of my true friends; I now know their
      value.&mdash;I feared I must have lost your esteem, but the proof you have
      given me by this visit touches me more deeply than your ten years&rsquo; 
      attachment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an object of curiosity to the whole house,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Oh!
      my dear, is this a part for you to be playing? Could you not be happy and
      yet remain honored?&mdash;I have just heard that you are Monsieur Etienne
      Lousteau&rsquo;s mistress, that you live together as man and wife!&mdash;You
      have broken for ever with society; even if you should some day marry your
      lover, the time will come when you will feel the want of the
      respectability you now despise. Ought you not to be in a home of your own
      with your mother, who loves you well enough to protect you with her aegis?&mdash;Appearances
      at least would be saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in the wrong to have come here,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;that is all.&mdash;I
      have bid farewell to all the advantages which the world confers on women
      who know how to reconcile happiness and the proprieties. My abnegation is
      so complete that I only wish I could clear a vast space about me to make a
      desert of my love, full of God, of <i>him</i>, and of myself.&mdash;We
      have made too many sacrifices on both sides not to be united&mdash;united
      by disgrace if you will, but indissolubly one. I am happy; so happy that I
      can love freely, my friend, and confide in you more than of old&mdash;for
      I need a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was magnanimous, nay, truly great. To this declaration, in
      which Dinah&rsquo;s soul thrilled, he replied in heartrending tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to go to see you, to be sure that you were loved: I shall now be
      easy and no longer alarmed as to your future.&mdash;But will your lover
      appreciate the magnitude of your sacrifice; is there any gratitude in his
      affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the Rue des Martyrs and you will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will call,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have already passed your door without
      daring to inquire for you.&mdash;You do not yet know the literary world.
      There are glorious exceptions, no doubt; but these men of letters drag
      terrible evils in their train; among these I account publicity as one of
      the greatest, for it blights everything. A woman may commit herself with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a Public Prosecutor?&rdquo; the Baronne put in with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;and then after a rupture there is still something to fall
      back on; the world has known nothing. But with a more or less famous man
      the public is thoroughly informed. Why look there! What an example you
      have close at hand! You are sitting back to back with the Comtesse Marie
      Vandenesse, who was within an ace of committing the utmost folly for a
      more celebrated man than Lousteau&mdash;for Nathan&mdash;and now they do
      not even recognize each other. After going to the very edge of the
      precipice, the Countess was saved, no one knows how; she neither left her
      husband nor her house; but as a famous man was scorned, she was the talk
      of the town for a whole winter. But her husband&rsquo;s great fortune, great
      name, and high position, but for the admirable management of that true
      statesman&mdash;whose conduct to his wife, they say, was perfect&mdash;she
      would have been ruined; in her position no other woman would have remained
      respected as she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how was Sancerre when you came away?&rdquo; asked Madame de la Baudraye, to
      change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de la Baudraye announced that your expected confinement after so
      many years made it necessary that it should take place in Paris, and that
      he had insisted on your going to be attended by the first physicians,&rdquo;
       replied Monsieur de Clagny, guessing what it was that Dinah most wanted to
      know. &ldquo;And so, in spite of the commotion to which your departure gave
      rise, you still have your legal status.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;can Monsieur de la Baudraye still hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband, madame, did what he always does&mdash;made a little
      calculation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer left the box when the journalist returned, bowing with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a greater hit than the piece,&rdquo; said Etienne to Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brief triumph brought greater happiness to the poor woman than she
      had ever known in the whole of her provincial existence; still, as they
      left the theatre she was very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you, my Didine?&rdquo; asked Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wondering how a woman succeeds in conquering the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways. One is by being Madame de Stael, the other is by
      having two hundred thousand francs a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;asserts its hold on us by appealing to our vanity,
      our love of appearances.&mdash;Pooh! We will be philosophers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening was the last gleam of the delusive well-being in which Madame
      de la Baudraye had lived since coming to Paris. Three days later she
      observed a cloud on Lousteau&rsquo;s brow as he walked round the little
      garden-plot smoking a cigar. This woman, who had acquired from her husband
      the habit and the pleasure of never owing anybody a sou, was informed that
      the household was penniless, with two quarters&rsquo; rent owing, and on the
      eve, in fact, of an execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reality of Paris life pierced Dinah&rsquo;s heart like a thorn; she
      repented of having tempted Etienne into the extravagances of love. It is
      so difficult to pass from pleasure to work, that happiness has wrecked
      more poems than sorrows ever helped to flow in sparkling jets. Dinah,
      happy in seeing Etienne taking his ease, smoking a cigar after breakfast,
      his face beaming as he basked like a lizard in the sunshine, could not
      summon up courage enough to make herself the bum-bailiff of a magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck her that through the worthy Migeon, Pamela&rsquo;s father, she might
      pawn the few jewels she possessed, on which her &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; for she was
      learning to talk the slang of the town, advanced her nine hundred francs.
      She kept three hundred for her baby-clothes and the expenses of her
      illness, and joyfully presented the sum due to Lousteau, who was
      ploughing, furrow by furrow, or, if you will, line by line, through a
      novel for a periodical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest heart,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;finish your novel without making any sacrifice
      to necessity; polish the style, work up the subject.&mdash;I have played
      the fine lady too long; I am going to be the housewife and attend to
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the last four months Etienne had been taking Dinah to the Cafe Riche
      to dine every day, a corner being always kept for them. The countrywoman
      was in dismay at being told that five hundred francs were owing for the
      last fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! we have been drinking wine at six francs a bottle! A sole <i>Normande</i>
      costs five francs!&mdash;and twenty centimes for a roll?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      as she looked through the bill Lousteau showed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it makes very little difference to us whether we are robbed at a
      restaurant or by a cook,&rdquo; said Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henceforth, for the cost of your dinner, you shall live like a prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having induced the landlord to let her have a kitchen and two servants&rsquo; 
      rooms, Madame de la Baudraye wrote a few lines to her mother, begging her
      to send her some linen and a loan of a thousand francs. She received two
      trunks full of linen, some plate, and two thousand francs, sent by the
      hand of an honest and pious cook recommended her by her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days after the evening at the theatre when they had met, Monsieur de
      Clagny came to call at four o&rsquo;clock, after coming out of court, and found
      Madame de la Baudraye making a little cap. The sight of this proud and
      ambitious woman, whose mind was so accomplished, and who had queened it so
      well at the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy, now condescending to household cares and
      sewing for the coming infant, moved the poor lawyer, who had just left the
      bench. And as he saw the pricks on one of the taper fingers he had so
      often kissed, he understood that Madame de la Baudraye was not merely
      playing at this maternal task.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this first interview the magistrate saw to the depths of
      Dinah&rsquo;s soul. This perspicacity in a man so much in love was a superhuman
      effort. He saw that Didine meant to be the journalist&rsquo;s guardian spirit
      and lead him into a nobler road; she had seen that the difficulties of his
      practical life were due to some moral defects. Between two beings united
      by love&mdash;in one so genuine, and in the other so well feigned&mdash;more
      than one confidence had been exchanged in the course of four months.
      Notwithstanding the care with which Etienne wrapped up his true self, a
      word now and then had not failed to enlighten Dinah as to the previous
      life of a man whose talents were so hampered by poverty, so perverted by
      bad examples, so thwarted by obstacles beyond his courage to surmount. &ldquo;He
      will be a greater man if life is easy to him,&rdquo; said she to herself. And
      she strove to make him happy, to give him the sense of a sheltered home by
      dint of such economy and method as are familiar to provincial folks. Thus
      Dinah became a housekeeper, as she had become a poet, by the soaring of
      her soul towards the heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His happiness will be my absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, wrung from Madame de la Baudraye by her friend the lawyer,
      accounted for the existing state of things. The publicity of his triumph,
      flaunted by Etienne on the evening of the first performance, had very
      plainly shown the lawyer what Lousteau&rsquo;s purpose was. To Etienne, Madame
      de la Baudraye was, to use his own phrase, &ldquo;a fine feather in his cap.&rdquo;
       Far from preferring the joys of a shy and mysterious passion, of hiding
      such exquisite happiness from the eyes of the world, he found a vulgar
      satisfaction in displaying the first woman of respectability who had ever
      honored him with her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge, however, was for some time deceived by the attentions which any
      man would lavish on any woman in Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s situation, and
      Lousteau made them doubly charming by the ingratiating ways characteristic
      of men whose manners are naturally attractive. There are, in fact, men who
      have something of the monkey in them by nature, and to whom the assumption
      of the most engaging forms of sentiment is so easy that the actor is not
      detected; and Lousteau&rsquo;s natural gifts had been fully developed on the
      stage on which he had hitherto figured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the months of April and July, when Dinah expected her confinement,
      she discovered why it was that Lousteau had not triumphed over poverty; he
      was idle and had no power of will. The brain, to be sure, must obey its
      own laws; it recognizes neither the exigencies of life nor the voice of
      honor; a man cannot write a great book because a woman is dying, or to pay
      a discreditable debt, or to bring up a family; at the same time, there is
      no great talent without a strong will. These twin forces are requisite for
      the erection of the vast edifice of personal glory. A distinguished genius
      keeps his brain in a productive condition, just as the knights of old kept
      their weapons always ready for battle. They conquer indolence, they deny
      themselves enervating pleasures, or indulge only to a fixed limit
      proportioned to their powers. This explains the life of such men as Walter
      Scott, Cuvier, Voltaire, Newton, Buffon, Bayle, Bossuet, Leibnitz, Lopez
      de Vega, Calderon, Boccacio, Aretino, Aristotle&mdash;in short, every man
      who delighted, governed, or led his contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man may and ought to pride himself more on his will than on his talent.
      Though Talent has its germ in a cultivated gift, Will means the incessant
      conquest of his instincts, of proclivities subdued and mortified, and
      difficulties of every kind heroically defeated. The abuse of smoking
      encouraged Lousteau&rsquo;s indolence. Tobacco, which can lull grief, inevitably
      numbs a man&rsquo;s energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the cigar deteriorated him physically, criticism as a
      profession morally stultified a man so easily tempted by pleasure.
      Criticism is as fatal to the critic as seeing two sides to a question is
      to a pleader. In these professions the judgment is undermined, the mind
      loses its lucid rectitude. The writer lives by taking sides. Thus, we may
      distinguish two kinds of criticism, as in painting we may distinguish art
      from practical dexterity. Criticism, after the pattern of most
      contemporary leader-writers, is the expression of judgments formed at
      random in a more or less witty way, just as an advocate pleads in court on
      the most contradictory briefs. The newspaper critic always finds a subject
      to work up in the book he is discussing. Done after this fashion, the
      business is well adapted to indolent brains, to men devoid of the sublime
      faculty of imagination, or, possessed of it indeed, but lacking courage to
      cultivate it. Every play, every book comes to their pen as a subject,
      making no demand on their imagination, and of which they simply write a
      report, seriously or in irony, according to the mood of the moment. As to
      an opinion, whatever it may be, French wit can always justify it, being
      admirably ready to defend either side of any case. And conscience counts
      for so little, these <i>bravi</i> have so little value for their own
      words, that they will loudly praise in the greenroom the work they tear to
      tatters in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, men have been known to transfer their services from one paper to
      another without being at the pains to consider that the opinions of the
      new sheet must be diametrically antagonistic to those of the old. Madame
      de la Baudraye could smile to see Lousteau with one article on the
      Legitimist side and one on the side of the new dynasty, both on the same
      occasion. She admired the maxim he preached:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the attorneys of public opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other kind of criticism is a science. It necessitates a thorough
      comprehension of each work, a lucid insight into the tendencies of the
      age, the adoption of a system, and faith in fixed principles&mdash;that is
      to say, a scheme of jurisprudence, a summing-up, and a verdict. The critic
      is then a magistrate of ideas, the censor of his time; he fulfils a sacred
      function; while in the former case he is but an acrobat who turns
      somersaults for a living so long as he had a leg to stand on. Between
      Claude Vignon and Lousteau lay the gulf that divides mere dexterity from
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, whose mind was soon freed from rust, and whose intellect was by no
      means narrow, had ere long taken literary measure of her idol. She saw
      Lousteau working up to the last minute under the most discreditable
      compulsion, and scamping his work, as painters say of a picture from which
      sound technique is absent; but she would excuse him by saying, &ldquo;He is a
      poet!&rdquo; so anxious was she to justify him in her own eyes. When she thus
      guessed the secret of many a writer&rsquo;s existence, she also guessed that
      Lousteau&rsquo;s pen could never be trusted to as a resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her love for him led her to take a step she would never had thought
      of for her own sake. Through her mother she tried to negotiate with her
      husband for an allowance, but without Etienne&rsquo;s knowledge; for, as she
      thought, it would be an offence to his delicate feelings, which must be
      considered. A few days before the end of July, Dinah crumbled up in her
      wrath the letter from her mother containing Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s
      ultimatum:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye cannot need an allowance in Paris when she can live
      in perfect luxury at her Chateau of Anzy: she may return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau picked up this letter and read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will avenge you!&rdquo; said he to Dinah in the ominous tone that delights a
      woman when her antipathies are flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days after this Bianchon and Duriau, the famous ladies&rsquo; doctor, were
      engaged at Lousteau&rsquo;s; for he, ever since little La Baudraye&rsquo;s reply, had
      been making a great display of his joy and importance over the advent of
      the infant. Monsieur de Clagny and Madame Piedefer&mdash;sent for in all
      haste were to be the godparents, for the cautious magistrate feared lest
      Lousteau should commit some compromising blunder. Madame de la Baudraye
      gave birth to a boy that might have filled a queen with envy who hoped for
      an heir-presumptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bianchon and Monsieur de Clagny went off to register the child at the
      Mayor&rsquo;s office as the son of Monsieur and Madame de la Baudraye, unknown
      to Etienne, who, on his part, rushed off to a printer&rsquo;s to have this
      circular set up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>&ldquo;Madame la Baronne de la Baudraye is happily delivered of a son.</i>

  <i>&ldquo;Monsieur Etienne Lousteau has the pleasure of informing you of
  the fact.</i>

  <i>&ldquo;The mother and child are doing well.&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Lousteau had already sent out sixty of these announcements when Monsieur
      de Clagny, on coming to make inquiries, happened to see the list of
      persons at Sancerre to whom Lousteau proposed to send this amazing notice,
      written below the names of the persons in Paris to whom it was already
      gone. The lawyer confiscated the list and the remainder of the circulars,
      showed them to Madame Piedefer, begging her on no account to allow
      Lousteau to carry on this atrocious jest, and jumped into a cab. The
      devoted friend then ordered from the same printer another announcement in
      the following words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>&ldquo;Madame la Baronne de la Baudraye is happily delivered of a son.</i>

  <i>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron de la Baudraye has the honor of informing you
  of the fact.</i>

  <i>&ldquo;Mother and child are doing well.&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      After seeing the proofs destroyed, the form of type, everything that could
      bear witness to the existence of the former document, Monsieur de Clagny
      set to work to intercept those that had been sent; in many cases he
      changed them at the porter&rsquo;s lodge, he got back thirty into his own hands,
      and at last, after three days of hard work, only one of the original notes
      existed, that, namely sent to Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times had the lawyer called on the great man without finding him. By
      the time Monsieur de Clagny was admitted, after requesting an interview,
      the story of the announcement was known to all Paris. Some persons
      regarded it as one of those waggish calumnies, a sort of stab to which
      every reputation, even the most ephemeral, is exposed; others said they
      had read the paper and returned it to some friend of the La Baudraye
      family; a great many declaimed against the immorality of journalists; in
      short, this last remaining specimen was regarded as a curiosity. Florine,
      with whom Nathan was living, had shown it about, stamped in the post as
      paid, and addressed in Etienne&rsquo;s hand. So, as soon as the judge spoke of
      the announcement, Nathan began to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give up that monument of recklessness and folly?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;That
      autograph is one of those weapons which an athlete in the circus cannot
      afford to lay down. That note proves that Lousteau has no heart, no taste,
      no dignity; that he knows nothing of the world nor of public morality;
      that he insults himself when he can find no one else to insult.&mdash;None
      but the son of a provincial citizen imported from Sancerre to become a
      poet, but who is only the <i>bravo</i> of some contemptible magazine,
      could ever have sent out such a circular letter, as you must allow,
      monsieur. This is a document indispensable to the archives of the age.&mdash;To-day
      Lousteau flatters me, to-morrow he may ask for my head.&mdash;Excuse me, I
      forgot you were a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have gone through a passion for a lady, a great lady, as far superior
      to Madame de la Baudraye as your fine feeling, monsieur, is superior to
      Lousteau&rsquo;s vulgar retaliation; but I would have died rather than utter her
      name. A few months of her airs and graces cost me a hundred thousand
      francs and my prospects for life; but I do not think the price too high!&mdash;And
      I have never murmured!&mdash;If a woman betrays the secret of her passion,
      it is the supreme offering of her love, but a man!&mdash;He must be a
      Lousteau!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I would not give up that paper for a thousand crowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the lawyer at last, after an eloquent battle lasting half
      an hour, &ldquo;I have called on fifteen or sixteen men of letters about this
      affair, and can it be that you are the only one immovable by an appeal of
      honor? It is not for Etienne Lousteau that I plead, but for a woman and
      child, both equally ignorant of the damage done to their fortune, their
      prospects, and their honor.&mdash;Who knows, monsieur, whether you might
      not some day be compelled to plead for some favor of justice for a friend,
      for some person whose honor was dearer to you than your own.&mdash;It
      might be remembered against you that you had been ruthless.&mdash;Can such
      a man as you are hesitate?&rdquo; added Monsieur de Clagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wished you to understand the extent of the sacrifice,&rdquo; replied
      Nathan, giving up the letter, as he reflected on the judge&rsquo;s influence and
      accepted this implied bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the journalist&rsquo;s stupid jest had been counteracted, Monsieur de
      Clagny went to give him a rating in the presence of Madame Piedefer; but
      he found Lousteau fuming with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I did monsieur, I did with a purpose!&rdquo; replied Etienne. &ldquo;Monsieur de
      la Baudraye has sixty thousand francs a year and refuses to make his wife
      an allowance; I wished to make him feel that the child is in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, I quite suspected it,&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;For that
      reason I readily agreed to be little Polydore&rsquo;s godfather, and he is
      registered as the son of the Baron and Baronne de la Baudraye; if you have
      the feelings of a father, you ought to rejoice in knowing that the child
      is heir to one of the finest entailed estates in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, sir, is the mother to die of hunger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite easy,&rdquo; said the lawyer bitterly, having dragged from Lousteau
      the expression of feeling he had so long been expecting. &ldquo;I will undertake
      to transact the matter with Monsieur de la Baudraye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Clagny left the house with a chill at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, his idol, was loved for her money. Would she not, when too late,
      have her eyes opened?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; said the lawyer, as he walked away. And this justice we will
      do him&mdash;for to whom should justice be done unless to a Judge?&mdash;he
      loved Dinah too sincerely to regard her degradation as a means of triumph
      one day; he was all pity and devotion; he really loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The care and nursing of the infant, its cries, the quiet needed for the
      mother during the first few days, and the ubiquity of Madame Piedefer,
      were so entirely adverse to literary labors, that Lousteau moved up to the
      three rooms taken on the first floor for the old bigot. The journalist,
      obliged to go to the first performances without Dinah, and living apart
      from her, found an indescribable charm in the use of his liberty. More
      than once he submitted to be taken by the arm and dragged off to some
      jollification; more than once he found himself at the house of a friend&rsquo;s
      mistress in the heart of bohemia. He again saw women brilliantly young and
      splendidly dressed, in whom economy seemed treason to their youth and
      power. Dinah, in spite of her striking beauty, after nursing her baby for
      three months, could not stand comparison with these perishable blossoms,
      so soon faded, but so showy as long as they live rooted in opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home life had, nevertheless, a strong attraction for Etienne. In three
      months the mother and daughter, with the help of the cook from Sancerre
      and of little Pamela, had given the apartment a quite changed appearance.
      The journalist found his breakfast and his dinner served with a sort of
      luxury. Dinah, handsome and nicely dressed, was careful to anticipate her
      dear Etienne&rsquo;s wishes, and he felt himself the king of his home, where
      everything, even the baby, was subject to his selfishness. Dinah&rsquo;s
      affection was to be seen in every trifle, Lousteau could not possibly
      cease the entrancing deceptions of his unreal passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, meanwhile, was aware of a source of ruin, both to her love and to
      the household, in the kind of life into which Lousteau had allowed himself
      to drift. At the end of ten months she weaned her baby, installed her
      mother in the upstairs rooms, and restored the family intimacy which
      indissolubly links a man and woman when the woman is loving and clever.
      One of the most striking circumstances in Benjamin Constant&rsquo;s novel, one
      of the explanations of Ellenore&rsquo;s desertion, is the want of daily&mdash;or,
      if you will, of nightly&mdash;intercourse between her and Adolphe. Each of
      the lovers has a separate home; they have both submitted to the world and
      saved appearances. Ellenore, repeatedly left to herself, is compelled to
      vast labors of affection to expel the thoughts of release which captivate
      Adolphe when absent. The constant exchange of glances and thoughts in
      domestic life gives a woman such power that a man needs stronger reasons
      for desertion than she will ever give him so long as she loves him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an entirely new phase both to Etienne and to Dinah. Dinah
      intended to be indispensable; she wanted to infuse fresh energy into this
      man, whose weakness smiled upon her, for she thought it a security. She
      found him subjects, sketched the treatment, and at a pinch, would write
      whole chapters. She revived the vitality of this dying talent by
      transfusing fresh blood into his veins; she supplied him with ideas and
      opinions. In short, she produced two books which were a success. More than
      once she saved Lousteau&rsquo;s self-esteem by dictating, correcting, or
      finishing his articles when he was in despair at his own lack of ideas.
      The secret of this collaboration was strictly preserved; Madame Piedefer
      knew nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mental galvanism was rewarded by improved pay, enabling them to live
      comfortably till the end of 1838. Lousteau became used to seeing Dinah do
      his work, and he paid her&mdash;as the French people say in their vigorous
      lingo&mdash;in &ldquo;monkey money,&rdquo; nothing for her pains. This expenditure in
      self-sacrifice becomes a treasure which generous souls prize, and the more
      she gave the more she loved Lousteau; the time soon came when Dinah felt
      that it would be too bitter a grief ever to give him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then another child was coming, and this year was a terrible trial. In
      spite of the precautions of the two women, Etienne contracted debts; he
      worked himself to death to pay them off while Dinah was laid up; and,
      knowing him as she did, she thought him heroic. But after this effort,
      appalled at having two women, two children, and two maids on his hands, he
      was incapable of the struggle to maintain a family by his pen when he had
      failed to maintain even himself. So he let things take their chance. Then
      the ruthless speculator exaggerated the farce of love-making at home to
      secure greater liberty abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah proudly endured the burden of life without support. The one idea,
      &ldquo;He loves me!&rdquo; gave her superhuman strength. She worked as hard as the
      most energetic spirits of our time. At the risk of her beauty and health,
      Didine was to Lousteau what Mademoiselle Delachaux was to Gardane in
      Diderot&rsquo;s noble and true tale. But while sacrificing herself, she
      committed the magnanimous blunder of sacrificing dress. She had her gowns
      dyed, and wore nothing but black. She stank of black, as Malaga said,
      making fun mercilessly of Lousteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of 1839, Etienne, following the example of Louis XV., had, by
      dint of gradual capitulations of conscience, come to the point of
      establishing a distinction between his own money and the housekeeping
      money, just as Louis XV. drew the line between his privy purse and the
      public moneys. He deceived Dinah as to his earnings. On discovering this
      baseness, Madame de la Baudraye went through fearful tortures of jealousy.
      She wanted to live two lives&mdash;the life of the world and the life of a
      literary woman; she accompanied Lousteau to every first-night performance,
      and could detect in him many impulses of wounded vanity, for her black
      attire rubbed off, as it were, on him, clouding his brow, and sometimes
      leading him to be quite brutal. He was really the woman of the two; and he
      had all a woman&rsquo;s exacting perversity; he would reproach Dinah for the
      dowdiness of her appearance, even while benefiting by the sacrifice, which
      to a mistress is so cruel&mdash;exactly like a woman who, after sending a
      man through a gutter to save her honor, tells him she &ldquo;cannot bear dirt!&rdquo;
       when he comes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah then found herself obliged to gather up the rather loose reins of
      power by which a clever woman drives a man devoid of will. But in so doing
      she could not fail to lose much of her moral lustre. Such suspicions as
      she betrayed drag a woman into quarrels which lead to disrespect, because
      she herself comes down from the high level on which she had at first
      placed herself. Next she made some concession; Lousteau was allowed to
      entertain several of his friends&mdash;Nathan, Bixiou, Blondet, Finot,
      whose manners, language, and intercourse were depraving. They tried to
      convince Madame de la Baudraye that her principles and aversions were a
      survival of provincial prudishness; and they preached the creed of woman&rsquo;s
      superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, her jealousy put weapons into Lousteau&rsquo;s hands. During the
      carnival of 1840, she disguised herself to go to the balls at the
      Opera-house, and to suppers where she met courtesans, in order to keep an
      eye on all Etienne&rsquo;s amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of Mid-Lent&mdash;or rather, at eight on the morning after&mdash;Dinah
      came home from the ball in her fancy dress to go to bed. She had gone to
      spy on Lousteau, who, believing her to be ill, had engaged himself for
      that evening to Fanny Beaupre. The journalist, warned by a friend, had
      behaved so as to deceive the poor woman, only too ready to be deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stepped out of the hired cab, Dinah met Monsieur de la Baudraye, to
      whom the porter pointed her out. The little old man took his wife by the
      arm, saying, in an icy tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is you, madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sudden advent of conjugal authority, before which she felt herself so
      small, and, above all, these words, almost froze the heart of the unhappy
      woman caught in the costume of a <i>debardeur</i>. To escape Etienne&rsquo;s eye
      the more effectually, she had chosen a dress he was not likely to detect
      her in. She took advantage of the mask she still had on to escape without
      replying, changed her dress, and went up to her mother&rsquo;s rooms, where she
      found her husband waiting for her. In spite of her assumed dignity, she
      blushed in the old man&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me, monsieur?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Are we not separated
      forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actually, yes,&rdquo; said Monsieur de la Baudraye. &ldquo;Legally, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Piedefer was telegraphing signals to her daughter, which Dinah
      presently observed and understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have brought you here but your own interests,&rdquo; she said, in
      a bitter tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Our</i> interests,&rdquo; said the little man coldly, &ldquo;for we have two
      children.&mdash;Your Uncle Silas Piedefer is dead, at New York, where,
      after having made and lost several fortunes in various parts of the world,
      he has finally left some seven or eight hundred thousand francs&mdash;they
      say twelve&mdash;but there is stock-in-trade to be sold. I am the chief in
      our common interests, and act for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Dinah, &ldquo;in everything that relates to business, I trust no one
      but Monsieur de Clagny. He knows the law, come to terms with him; what he
      does, will be done right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no occasion for Monsieur de Clagny,&rdquo; answered Monsieur de la
      Baudraye, &ldquo;to take my children from you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your children!&rdquo; exclaimed Dinah. &ldquo;Your children, to whom you have not
      sent a sou! <i>Your</i> children!&rdquo; She burst into a loud shout of
      laughter; but Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s unmoved coolness threw ice on the
      explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother has just brought them to show me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They are
      charming boys. I do not intend to part from them. I shall take them to our
      house at Anzy, if it were only to save them from seeing their mother
      disguised like a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye imperatively. &ldquo;What do you want of
      me that brought you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A power of attorney to receive our Uncle Silas&rsquo; property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah took a pen, wrote two lines to Monsieur de Clagny, and desired her
      husband to call again in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock, Monsieur de Clagny&mdash;who had been promoted to the
      post of Attorney-General&mdash;enlightened Madame de la Baudraye as to her
      position; still, he undertook to arrange everything by a bargain with the
      old fellow, whose visit had been prompted by avarice alone. Monsieur de la
      Baudraye, to whom his wife&rsquo;s power of attorney was indispensable to enable
      him to deal with the business as he wished, purchased it by certain
      concessions. In the first place, he undertook to allow her ten thousand
      francs a year so long as she found it convenient&mdash;so the document was
      worded&mdash;to reside in Paris; the children, each on attaining the age
      of six, were to be placed in Monsieur de la Baudraye&rsquo;s keeping. Finally,
      the lawyer extracted the payment of the allowance in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little La Baudraye, who came jauntily enough to say good-bye to his wife
      and <i>his</i> children, appeared in a white india-rubber overcoat. He was
      so firm on his feet, and so exactly like the La Baudraye of 1836, that
      Dinah despaired of ever burying the dreadful little dwarf. From the
      garden, where he was smoking a cigar, the journalist could watch Monsieur
      de la Baudraye for so long as it took the little reptile to cross the
      forecourt, but that was enough for Lousteau; it was plain to him that the
      little man had intended to wreck every hope of his dying that his wife
      might have conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      This short scene made a considerable change in the writer&rsquo;s secret
      scheming. As he smoked a second cigar, he seriously reviewed the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life with Madame de la Baudraye had hitherto cost him quite as much as
      it had cost her. To use the language of business, the two sides of the
      account balanced, and they could, if necessary, cry quits. Considering how
      small his income was, and how hardly he earned it, Lousteau regarded
      himself, morally speaking, as the creditor. It was, no doubt, a favorable
      moment for throwing the woman over. Tired at the end of three years of
      playing a comedy which never can become a habit, he was perpetually
      concealing his weariness; and this fellow, who was accustomed to disguise
      none of his feelings, compelled himself to wear a smile at home like that
      of a debtor in the presence of his creditor. This compulsion was every day
      more intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the immense advantages he foresaw in the future had given him
      strength; but when he saw Monsieur de la Baudraye embark for the United
      States, as briskly as if it were to go down to Rouen in a steamboat, he
      ceased to believe in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in from the garden to the pretty drawing-room, where Dinah had
      just taken leave of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Etienne,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye, &ldquo;do you know what my lord and
      master has proposed to me? In the event of my wishing to return to live at
      Anzy during his absence, he has left his orders, and he hopes that my
      mother&rsquo;s good advice will weigh with me, and that I shall go back there
      with my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good advice,&rdquo; replied Lousteau drily, knowing the passionate
      disclaimer that Dinah expected, and indeed begged for with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone, the words, the cold look, all hit the hapless woman so hard, who
      lived only in her love, that two large tears trickled slowly down her
      cheeks, while she did not speak a word, and Lousteau only saw them when
      she took out her handkerchief to wipe away these two beads of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Didine?&rdquo; he asked, touched to the heart by this excessive
      sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I was priding myself on having won our freedom,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;at
      the cost of my fortune&mdash;by selling&mdash;what is most precious to a
      mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;selling my children!&mdash;for he is to have them
      from the age of six&mdash;and I cannot see them without going to Sancerre!&mdash;and
      that is torture!&mdash;Ah, dear God! What have I done&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau knelt down by her and kissed her hands with a lavish display of
      coaxing and petting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I blame myself, for I am not worth
      such sacrifices, dear angel. I am, in a literary sense, a quite
      second-rate man. If the day comes when I can no longer cut a figure at the
      bottom of the newspaper, the editors will let me lie, like an old shoe
      flung into the rubbish heap. Remember, we tight-rope dancers have no
      retiring pension! The State would have too many clever men on its hands if
      it started on such a career of beneficence. I am forty-two, and I am as
      idle as a marmot. I feel it&mdash;I know it&rdquo;&mdash;and he took her by the
      hand&mdash;&ldquo;my love can only be fatal to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you know, at two-and-twenty I lived on Florine; but what is excusable
      in a youth, what then seems smart and charming, is a disgrace to a man of
      forty. Hitherto we have shared the burden of existence, and it has not
      been lovely for this year and half. Out of devotion to me you wear nothing
      but black, and that does me no credit.&rdquo;&mdash;Dinah gave one of those
      magnanimous shrugs which are worth all the words ever spoken.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       Etienne went on, &ldquo;I know you sacrifice everything to my whims, even your
      beauty. And I, with a heart worn out in past struggles, a soul full of
      dark presentiments as to the future, I cannot repay your exquisite love
      with an equal affection. We were very happy&mdash;without a cloud&mdash;for
      a long time.&mdash;Well, then, I cannot bear to see so sweet a poem end
      badly. Am I wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye loved Etienne so truly, that this prudence, worthy
      of de Clagny, gratified her and stanched her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves me for myself alone!&rdquo; thought she, looking at him with smiling
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After four years of intimacy, this woman&rsquo;s love now combined every shade
      of affection which our powers of analysis can discern, and which modern
      society has created; one of the most remarkable men of our age, whose
      death is a recent loss to the world of letters, Beyle (Stendhal), was the
      first to delineate them to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau could produce in Dinah the acute agitation which may be compared
      to magnetism, that upsets every power of the mind and body, and overcomes
      every instinct of resistance in a woman. A look from him, or his hand laid
      on hers, reduced her to implicit obedience. A kind word or a smile
      wreathed the poor woman&rsquo;s soul with flowers; a fond look elated, a cold
      look depressed her. When she walked, taking his arm and keeping step with
      him in the street or on the boulevard, she was so entirely absorbed in him
      that she lost all sense of herself. Fascinated by this fellow&rsquo;s wit,
      magnetized by his airs, his vices were but trivial defects in her eyes.
      She loved the puffs of cigar smoke that the wind brought into her room
      from the garden; she went to inhale them, and made no wry faces, hiding
      herself to enjoy them. She hated the publisher or the newspaper editor who
      refused Lousteau money on the ground of the enormous advances he had had
      already. She deluded herself so far as to believe that her bohemian was
      writing a novel, for which the payment was to come, instead of working off
      a debt long since incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, no doubt, is true love, and includes every mode of loving; the love
      of the heart and of the head&mdash;passion, caprice, and taste&mdash;to
      accept Beyle&rsquo;s definitions. Didine loved him so wholly, that in certain
      moments when her critical judgment, just by nature, and constantly
      exercised since she had lived in Paris, compelled her to read to the
      bottom of Lousteau&rsquo;s soul, sense was still too much for reason, and
      suggested excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;A woman who has put herself outside the
      pale. Since I have sacrificed all a woman&rsquo;s honor, why should you not
      sacrifice to me some of a man&rsquo;s honor? Do we not live outside the limits
      of social conventionality? Why not accept from me what Nathan can accept
      from Florine? We will square accounts when we part, and only death can
      part us&mdash;you know. My happiness is your honor, Etienne, as my
      constancy and your happiness are mine. If I fail to make you happy, all is
      at an end. If I cause you a pang, condemn me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our debts are paid; we have ten thousand francs a year, and between us we
      can certainly make eight thousand francs a year&mdash;I will write
      theatrical articles.&mdash;With fifteen hundred francs a month we shall be
      as rich as Rothschild.&mdash;Be quite easy. I will have some lovely
      dresses, and give you every day some gratified vanity, as on the first
      night of Nathan&rsquo;s play&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about your mother, who goes to Mass every day, and wants to
      bring a priest to the house and make you give up this way of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one has a pet vice. You smoke, she preaches at me, poor woman! But
      she takes great care of the children, she takes them out, she is
      absolutely devoted, and idolizes me. Would you hinder her from crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be thought of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we do not live for the world!&rdquo; cried she, raising Etienne and making
      him sit by her. &ldquo;Besides, we shall be married some day&mdash;we have the
      risks of a sea voyage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said Lousteau simply; and he added to himself,
      &ldquo;Time enough to part when little La Baudraye is safe back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that day forth Etienne lived in luxury; and Dinah, on first nights,
      could hold her own with the best dressed women in Paris. Lousteau was so
      fatuous as to affect, among his friends, the attitude of a man overborne,
      bored to extinction, ruined by Madame de la Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what would I not give to the friend who would deliver me from Dinah!
      But no one ever can!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She loves me enough to throw herself out
      of the window if I told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The journalist was duly pitied; he would take precautions against Dinah&rsquo;s
      jealousy when he accepted an invitation. And then he was shamelessly
      unfaithful. Monsieur de Clagny, really in despair at seeing Dinah in such
      disgraceful circumstances when she might have been so rich, and in so
      wretched a position at the time when her original ambitions would have
      been fulfilled, came to warn her, to tell her&mdash;&ldquo;You are betrayed,&rdquo;
       and she only replied, &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was silenced; still he found his tongue to say one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye interrupted him when he had scarcely spoken a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still love me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would lose my soul for you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hapless man&rsquo;s eyes flashed like torches, he trembled like a leaf, his
      throat was rigid, his hair thrilled to the roots; he believed he was so
      blessed as to be accepted as his idol&rsquo;s avenger, and this poor joy filled
      him with rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so startled?&rdquo; said she, making him sit down again. &ldquo;That is
      how I love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer understood this argument <i>ad hominem</i>. And there were
      tears in the eyes of the Judge, who had just condemned a man to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau&rsquo;s satiety, that odious conclusion of such illicit relations, had
      betrayed itself in a thousand little things, which are like grains of sand
      thrown against the panes of the little magical hut where those who love
      dwell and dream. These grains of sand, which grow to be pebbles, had never
      been discerned by Dinah till they were as big as rocks. Madame de la
      Baudraye had at last thoroughly understood Lousteau&rsquo;s character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; she said to her mother, &ldquo;a poet, defenceless against disaster,
      mean out of laziness, not for want of heart, and rather too prone to
      pleasure; in short, a great cat, whom it is impossible to hate. What would
      become of him without me? I hindered his marriage; he has no prospects.
      His talent would perish in privations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Dinah!&rdquo; Madame Piedefer had exclaimed, &ldquo;what a hell you live in!
      What is the feeling that gives you strength enough to persist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be a mother to him!&rdquo; she had replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain horrible situations in which we come to no decision till
      the moment when our friends discern our dishonor. We accept compromises
      with ourself so long as we escape a censor who comes to play prosecutor.
      Monsieur de Clagny, as clumsy as a tortured man, had been torturing Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To preserve my love I will be all that Madame de Pompadour was to
      preserve her power,&rdquo; said she to herself when Monsieur de Clagny had left
      her. And this phrase sufficiently proves that her love was becoming a
      burden to her, and would presently be a toil rather than a pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part now assumed by Dinah was horribly painful, and Lousteau made it
      no easier to play. When he wanted to go out after dinner he would perform
      the tenderest little farces of affection, and address Dinah in words full
      of devotion; he would take her by the chain, and when he had bruised her
      with it, even while he hurt her, the lordly ingrate would say, &ldquo;Did I
      wound you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These false caresses and deceptions had degrading consequences for Dinah,
      who believed in a revival of his love. The mother, alas, gave way to the
      mistress with shameful readiness. She felt herself a mere plaything in the
      man&rsquo;s hands, and at last she confessed to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will be his plaything!&rdquo; finding joy in it&mdash;the rapture
      of damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this woman, of a really manly spirit, pictured herself as living in
      solitude, she felt her courage fail. She preferred the anticipated and
      inevitable miseries of this fierce intimacy to the absence of the joys,
      which were all the more exquisite because they arose from the midst of
      remorse, of terrible struggles with herself, of a <i>No</i> persuaded to
      be <i>Yes</i>. At every moment she seemed to come across the pool of
      bitter water found in a desert, and drunk with greater relish than the
      traveler would find in sipping the finest wines at a prince&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dinah wondered to herself at midnight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he come home, or will he not?&rdquo; she was not alive again till she
      heard the familiar sound of Lousteau&rsquo;s boots, and his well-known ring at
      the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would often try to restrain him by giving him pleasure; she would hope
      to be a match for her rivals, and leave them no hold on that agitated
      heart. How many times a day would she rehearse the tragedy of <i>Le
      Dernier Jour d&rsquo;un condamne</i>, saying to herself, &ldquo;To-morrow we part.&rdquo;
       And how often would a word, a look, a kiss full of apparently artless
      feeling, bring her back to the depths of her love!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was terrible. More than once had she meditated suicide as she paced the
      little town garden where a few pale flowers bloomed. In fact, she had not
      yet exhausted the vast treasure of devotion and love which a loving woman
      bears in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The romance of <i>Adolphe</i> was her Bible, her study, for above all else
      she would not be an Ellenore. She allowed herself no tears, she avoided
      all the bitterness so cleverly described by the critic to whom we owe an
      analysis of this striking work; whose comments indeed seemed to Dinah
      almost superior to the book. And she read again and again this fine essay
      by the only real critic who has written in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
      an article now printed at the beginning of the new edition of <i>Adolphe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she would say to herself, as she repeated the author&rsquo;s fateful
      words, &ldquo;no, I will not &lsquo;give my requests the form of an order,&rsquo; I will not
      &lsquo;fly to tears as a means of revenge,&rsquo; I will not &lsquo;condemn the things I
      once approved without reservation,&rsquo; I will not &lsquo;dog his footsteps with a
      prying eye&rsquo;; if he plays truant, he shall not on his return &lsquo;see a
      scornful lip, whose kiss is an unanswerable command.&rsquo; No, &lsquo;my silence
      shall not be a reproach nor my first word a quarrel.&rsquo;&mdash;I will not be
      like every other woman!&rdquo; she went on, laying on her table the little
      yellow paper volume which had already attracted Lousteau&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;What!
      are you studying <i>Adolphe</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If for one day only he should
      recognize my merits and say, &lsquo;That victim never uttered a cry!&rsquo;&mdash;it
      will be all I ask. And besides, the others only have him for an hour; I
      have him for life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thinking himself justified by his private tribunal in punishing his wife,
      Monsieur de la Baudraye robbed her to achieve his cherished enterprise of
      reclaiming three thousand acres of moorland, to which he had devoted
      himself ever since 1836, living like a mouse. He manipulated the property
      left by Monsieur Silas Piedefer so ingeniously, that he contrived to
      reduce the proved value to eight hundred thousand francs, while pocketing
      twelve hundred thousand. He did not announce his return; but while his
      wife was enduring unspeakable woes, he was building farms, digging
      trenches, and ploughing rough ground with a courage that ranked him among
      the most remarkable agriculturists of the province.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four hundred thousand francs he had filched from his wife were spent
      in three years on this undertaking, and the estate of Anzy was expected to
      return seventy-two thousand francs a year of net profits after the taxes
      were paid. The eight hundred thousand he invested at four and a half per
      cent in the funds, buying at eighty francs, at the time of the financial
      crisis brought about by the Ministry of the First of March, as it was
      called. By thus securing to his wife an income of forty-eight thousand
      francs he considered himself no longer in her debt. Could he not restore
      the odd twelve hundred thousand as soon as the four and a half per cents
      had risen above a hundred? He was now the greatest man in Sancerre, with
      the exception of one&mdash;the richest proprietor in France&mdash;whose
      rival he considered himself. He saw himself with an income of a hundred
      and forty thousand francs, of which ninety thousand formed the revenue
      from the lands he had entailed. Having calculated that besides this net
      income he paid ten thousand francs in taxes, three thousand in working
      expenses, ten thousand to his wife, and twelve hundred to his
      mother-in-law, he would say in the literary circles of Sancerre:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am reputed miserly, and said to spend nothing; but my outlay amounts to
      twenty-six thousand five hundred francs a year. And I have still to pay
      for the education of my two children! I daresay it is not a pleasing fact
      to the Milauds of Nevers, but the second house of La Baudraye may yet have
      as noble a center as the first.&mdash;I shall most likely go to Paris and
      petition the King of the French to grant me the title of Count&mdash;Monsieur
      Roy is a Count&mdash;and my wife would be pleased to be Madame la
      Comtesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was said with such splendid coolness that no one would have dared
      to laugh at the little man. Only Monsieur Boirouge, the Presiding Judge,
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your place, I should not be happy unless I had a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall go to Paris before long&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of 1842 Madame de la Baudraye, feeling that she was to
      Lousteau no more than a reserve in the background, had again sacrificed
      herself absolutely to secure his comfort; she had resumed her black
      raiment, but now it was in sign of mourning, for her pleasure was turning
      to remorse. She was too often put to shame not to feel the weight of the
      chain, and her mother found her sunk in those moods of meditation into
      which visions of the future cast unhappy souls in a sort of torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Piedefer, by the advice of her spiritual director, was on the watch
      for the moment of exhaustion, which the priest told her would inevitably
      supervene, and then she pleaded in behalf of the children. She restricted
      herself to urging that Dinah and Lousteau should live apart, not asking
      her to give him up. In real life these violent situations are not closed
      as they are in books, by death or cleverly contrived catastrophes; they
      end far less poetically&mdash;in disgust, in the blighting of every flower
      of the soul, in the commonplace of habit, and very often too in another
      passion, which robs a wife of the interest which is traditionally ascribed
      to women. So, when common sense, the law of social proprieties, family
      interest&mdash;all the mixed elements which, since the Restoration, have
      been dignified by the mane of Public Morals, out of sheer aversion to the
      name of the Catholic religion&mdash;where this is seconded by a sense of
      insults a little too offensive; when the fatigue of constant
      self-sacrifice has almost reached the point of exhaustion; and when, under
      these circumstances, a too cruel blow&mdash;one of those mean acts which a
      man never lets a woman know of unless he believes himself to be her
      assured master&mdash;puts the crowning touch to her revulsion and
      disenchantment, the moment has come for the intervention of the friend who
      undertakes the cure. Madame Piedefer had no great difficulty now in
      removing the film from her daughter&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent for Monsieur de Clagny, who completed the work by assuring Madame
      de la Baudraye that if she would give up Etienne, her husband would allow
      her to keep the children and to live in Paris, and would restore her to
      the command of her own fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a life you are leading!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;With care and judgment, and
      the support of some pious and charitable persons, you may have a salon and
      conquer a position. Paris is not Sancerre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinah left it to Monsieur de Clagny to negotiate a reconciliation with the
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de la Baudraye had sold his wine well, he had sold his wool, he
      had felled his timber, and, without telling his wife, he had come to Paris
      to invest two hundred thousand francs in the purchase of a delightful
      residence in the Rue de l&rsquo;Arcade, that was being sold in liquidation of an
      aristocratic House that was in difficulties. He had been a member of the
      Council for the Department since 1826, and now, paying ten thousand francs
      in taxes, he was doubly qualified for a peerage under the conditions of
      the new legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time before the elections of 1842 he had put himself forward as
      candidate unless he were meanwhile called to the Upper House as Peer of
      France. At the same time, he asked for the title of Count, and for
      promotion to the higher grade of the Legion of Honor. In the matter of the
      elections, the dynastic nominations; now, in the event of Monsieur de la
      Baudraye being won over to the Government, Sancerre would be more than
      ever a rotten borough of royalism. Monsieur de Clagny, whose talents and
      modesty were more and more highly appreciated by the authorities, gave
      Monsieur de la Baudraye his support; he pointed out that by raising this
      enterprising agriculturist to the peerage, a guarantee would be offered to
      such important undertakings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de la Baudraye, then, a Count, a Peer of France, and Commander of
      the Legion of Honor, was vain enough to wish to cut a figure with a wife
      and handsomely appointed house.&mdash;&ldquo;He wanted to enjoy life,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore addressed a letter to his wife, dictated by Monsieur de
      Clagny, begging her to live under his roof and to furnish the house,
      giving play to the taste of which the evidences, he said, had charmed him
      at the Chateau d&rsquo;Anzy. The newly made Count pointed out to his wife that
      while the interests of their property forbade his leaving Sancerre, the
      education of their boys required her presence in Paris. The accommodating
      husband desired Monsieur de Clagny to place sixty thousand francs at the
      disposal of Madame la Comtesse for the interior decoration of their
      mansion, requesting that she would have a marble tablet inserted over the
      gateway with the inscription: <i>Hotel de la Baudraye</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then accounted to his wife for the money derived from the estate of
      Silas Piedefer, told her of the investment at four and a half per cent of
      the eight hundred thousand francs he had brought from New York, and
      allowed her that income for her expenses, including the education of the
      children. As he would be compelled to stay in Paris during some part of
      the session of the House of Peers, he requested his wife to reserve for
      him a little suite of rooms in an <i>entresol</i> over the kitchens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! why, he is growing young again&mdash;a gentleman!&mdash;a
      magnifico!&mdash;What will he become next? It is quite alarming,&rdquo; said
      Madame de la Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He now fulfils all your wishes at the age of twenty,&rdquo; replied the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison of her future prospects with her present position was
      unendurable to Dinah. Only the day before, Anna de Fontaine had turned her
      head away in order to avoid seeing her bosom friend at the Chamarolles&rsquo; 
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a countess,&rdquo; said Dinah to herself. &ldquo;I shall have the peer&rsquo;s blue
      hammer-cloth on my carriage, and the leaders of the literary world in my
      drawing-room&mdash;and I will look at her!&rdquo;&mdash;And it was this little
      triumph that told with all its weight at the moment of her rehabilitation,
      as the world&rsquo;s contempt had of old weighed on her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine day, in May 1842, Madame de la Baudraye paid all her little
      household debts and left a thousand crowns on top of the packet of
      receipted bills. After sending her mother and the children away to the
      Hotel de la Baudraye, she awaited Lousteau, dressed ready to leave the
      house. When the deposed king of her heart came into dinner, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have upset the pot, my dear. Madame de la Baudraye requests the
      pleasure of your company at the <i>Rocher de Cancale</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She carried off Lousteau, quite bewildered by the light and easy manners
      assumed by the woman who till that morning has been the slave of his least
      whim, for she too had been acting a farce for two months past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Baudraye is figged out as if for a first night,&rdquo; said he&mdash;<i>une
      premiere</i>, the slang abbreviation for a first performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget the respect you owe to Madame de la Baudraye,&rdquo; said Dinah
      gravely. &ldquo;I do not mean to understand such a word as <i>figged out</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didine a rebel!&rdquo; said he, putting his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such person as Didine; you have killed her, my dear,&rdquo; she
      replied, releasing herself. &ldquo;I am taking you to the first performance of
      <i>Madame la Comtesse de la Baudraye</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, then, that our insect is a peer of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nomination is to be gazetted in this evening&rsquo;s <i>Moniteur</i>, as I
      am told by Monsieur de Clagny, who is promoted to the Court of Appeal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is quite right,&rdquo; said the journalist. &ldquo;The entomology of society
      ought to be represented in the Upper House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, we are parting for ever,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye, trying
      to control the trembling of her voice. &ldquo;I have dismissed the two servants.
      When you go in, you will find the house in order, and no debts. I shall
      always feel a mother&rsquo;s affection for you, but in secret. Let us part
      calmly, without a fuss, like decent people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a fault to find with my conduct during the past six years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, but that you have spoiled my life, and wrecked my prospects,&rdquo; said
      he in a hard tone. &ldquo;You have read Benjamin Constant&rsquo;s book very
      diligently; you have even studied the last critique on it; but you have
      read with a woman&rsquo;s eyes. Though you have one of those superior intellects
      which would make a fortune of a poet, you have never dared to take the
      man&rsquo;s point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That book, my dear, is of both sexes.&mdash;We agreed that books were
      male or female, dark or fair. In <i>Adolphe</i> women see nothing but
      Ellenore; young men see only Adolphe; men of experience see Ellenore and
      Adolphe; political men see the whole of social existence. You did not
      think it necessary to read the soul of Adolphe&mdash;any more than your
      critic indeed, who saw only Ellenore. What kills that poor fellow, my
      dear, is that he has sacrificed his future for a woman; that he never can
      be what he might have been&mdash;an ambassador, a minister, a chamberlain,
      a poet&mdash;and rich. He gives up six years of his energy at that stage
      of his life when a man is ready to submit to the hardships of any
      apprenticeship&mdash;to a petticoat, which he outstrips in the career of
      ingratitude, for the woman who has thrown over her first lover is certain
      sooner or later to desert the second. Adolphe is, in fact, a tow-haired
      German, who has not spirit enough to be false to Ellenore. There are
      Adolphes who spare their Ellenores all ignominious quarreling and
      reproaches, who say to themselves, &lsquo;I will not talk of what I have
      sacrificed; I will not for ever be showing the stump of my wrist to let
      that incarnate selfishness I have made my queen,&rsquo; as Ramorny does in <i>The
      Fair Maid of Perth</i>. But men like that, my dear, get cast aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolphe is a man of birth, an aristocratic nature, who wants to get back
      into the highroad to honors and recover his social birthright, his
      blighted position.&mdash;You, at this moment, are playing both parts. You
      are suffering from the pangs of having lost your position, and think
      yourself justified in throwing over a hapless lover whose misfortune it
      has been that he fancied you so far superior as to understand that, though
      a man&rsquo;s heart ought to be true, his sex may be allowed to indulge its
      caprices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you suppose that I shall not make it my business to restore to you
      all you have lost by me? Be quite easy,&rdquo; said Madame de la Baudraye,
      astounded by this attack. &ldquo;Your Ellenore is not dying; and if God gives
      her life, if you amend your ways, if you give up courtesans and actresses,
      we will find you a better match than a Felicie Cardot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two lovers were sullen. Lousteau affected dejection, he aimed at
      appearing hard and cold; while Dinah, really distressed, listened to the
      reproaches of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Lousteau presently, &ldquo;why not end as we ought to have begun&mdash;hide
      our love from all eyes, and see each other in secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried the new-made Countess, with an icy look. &ldquo;Do you not
      comprehend that we are, after all, but finite creatures? Our feelings seem
      infinite by reason of our anticipation of heaven, but here on earth they
      are limited by the strength of our physical being. There are some feeble,
      mean natures which may receive an endless number of wounds and live on;
      but there are some more highly-tempered souls which snap at last under
      repeated blows. You have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! enough!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;No more copy! Your dissertation is unnecessary,
      since you can justify yourself by merely saying&mdash;&lsquo;I have ceased to
      love!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed in bewilderment. &ldquo;Is it I who have ceased to love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You have calculated that I gave you more trouble, more
      vexation than pleasure, and you desert your partner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desert!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; cried she, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have not you yourself just said &lsquo;Never&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, yes! <i>Never</i>,&rdquo; she repeated vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This final <i>Never</i>, spoken in the fear of falling once more under
      Lousteau&rsquo;s influence, was interpreted by him as the death-warrant of his
      power, since Dinah remained insensible to his sarcastic scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist could not suppress a tear. He was losing a sincere and
      unbounded affection. He had found in Dinah the gentlest La Valliere, the
      most delightful Pompadour that any egoist short of a king could hope for;
      and, like a boy who has discovered that by dint of tormenting a cockchafer
      he has killed it, Lousteau shed a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye rushed out of the private room where they had been
      dining, paid the bill, and fled home to the Rue de l&rsquo;Arcade, scolding
      herself and thinking herself a brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah, who had made her house a model of comfort, now metamorphosed
      herself. This double metamorphosis cost thirty thousand francs more than
      her husband had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal accident which in 1842 deprived the House of Orleans of the
      heir-presumptive having necessitated a meeting of the Chambers in August
      of that year, little La Baudraye came to present his titles to the Upper
      House sooner than he had expected, and then saw what his wife had done. He
      was so much delighted, that he paid the thirty thousand francs without a
      word, just as he had formerly paid eight thousand for decorating La
      Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return from the Luxembourg, where he had been presented according
      to custom by two of his peers&mdash;the Baron de Nucingen and the Marquis
      de Montriveau&mdash;the new Count met the old Duc de Chaulieu, a former
      creditor, walking along, umbrella in hand, while he himself sat perched in
      a low chaise on which his coat-of-arms was resplendent, with the motto, <i>Deo
      sic patet fides et hominibus</i>. This contrast filled his heart with a
      large draught of the balm on which the middle class has been getting drunk
      ever since 1840.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye was shocked to see her husband improved and looking
      better than on the day of his marriage. The little dwarf, full of
      rapturous delight, at sixty-four triumphed in the life which had so long
      been denied him; in the family, which his handsome cousin Milaud of Nevers
      had declared he would never have; and in his wife&mdash;who had asked
      Monsieur and Madame de Clagny to dinner to meet the cure of the parish and
      his two sponsors to the Chamber of Peers. He petted the children with
      fatuous delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handsome display on the table met with his approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the fleeces of the Berry sheep,&rdquo; said he, showing Monsieur de
      Nucingen the dish-covers surmounted by his newly-won coronet. &ldquo;They are of
      silver, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though consumed by melancholy, which she concealed with the determination
      of a really superior woman, Dinah was charming, witty, and above all,
      young again in her court mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might declare,&rdquo; cried La Baudraye to Monsieur de Nucingen with a wave
      of his hand to his wife, &ldquo;that the Countess was not yet thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! Matame is a voman of dirty!&rdquo; replied the baron, who was prone to
      time-honored remarks, which he took to be the small change of
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In every sense of the words,&rdquo; replied the Countess. &ldquo;I am, in fact,
      five-and-thirty, and mean to set up a little passion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my wife ruins me in curiosities and china images&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She started that mania at an early age,&rdquo; said the Marquis de Montriveau
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said La Baudraye, with a cold stare at the Marquis, whom he had
      known at Bourges, &ldquo;you know that in &lsquo;25, &lsquo;26, and &lsquo;27, she picked a
      million francs&rsquo; worth of treasures. Anzy is a perfect museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cool hand!&rdquo; thought Monsieur de Clagny, as he saw this little
      country miser quite on the level of his new position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But misers have savings of all kinds ready for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day after the vote on the Regency had passed the Chambers, the
      little Count went back to Sancerre for the vintage and resumed his old
      habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of that winter, the Comtesse de la Baudraye, with the
      support of the Attorney-General to the Court of Appeals, tried to form a
      little circle. Of course, she had an &ldquo;at home&rdquo; day, she made a selection
      among men of mark, receiving none but those of serious purpose and ripe
      years. She tried to amuse herself by going to the Opera, French and
      Italian. Twice a week she appeared there with her mother and Madame de
      Clagny, who was made by her husband to visit Dinah. Still, in spite of her
      cleverness, her charming manners, her fashionable stylishness, she was
      never really happy but with her children, on whom she lavished all her
      disappointed affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthy Monsieur de Clagny tried to recruit women for the Countess&rsquo; circle,
      and he succeeded; but he was more successful among the advocates of piety
      than the women of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they bore her!&rdquo; said he to himself with horror, as he saw his idol
      matured by grief, pale from remorse, and then, in all the splendor of
      recovered beauty, restored by a life of luxury and care for her boys. This
      devoted friend, encouraged in his efforts by her mother and by the cure
      was full of expedient. Every Wednesday he introduced some celebrity from
      Germany, England, Italy, or Prussia to his dear Countess; he spoke of her
      as a quite exceptional woman to people to whom she hardly addressed two
      words; but she listened to them with such deep attention that they went
      away fully convinced of her superiority. In Paris, Dinah conquered by
      silence, as at Sancerre she had conquered by loquacity. Now and then, some
      smart saying about affairs, or sarcasm on an absurdity, betrayed a woman
      accustomed to deal with ideas&mdash;the woman who, four years since, had
      given new life to Lousteau&rsquo;s articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phase was to the poor lawyer&rsquo;s hapless passion like the late season
      known as the Indian summer after a sunless year. He affected to be older
      than he was, to have the right to befriend Dinah without doing her an
      injury, and kept himself at a distance as though he were young, handsome,
      and compromising, like a man who has happiness to conceal. He tried to
      keep his little attentions a profound secret, and the trifling gifts which
      Dinah showed to every one; he endeavored to suggest a dangerous meaning
      for his little services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He plays at passion,&rdquo; said the Countess, laughing. She made fun of
      Monsieur de Clagny to his face, and the lawyer said, &ldquo;She notices me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I impress that poor man so deeply,&rdquo; said she to her mother, laughing,
      &ldquo;that if I would say Yes, I believe he would say No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening Monsieur de Clagny and his wife were taking his dear Countess
      home from the theatre, and she was deeply pensive. They had been to the
      first performance of Leon Gozlan&rsquo;s first play, <i>La Main Droite et la
      Main Gauche</i> (The Right Hand and the Left).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, alarmed at his idol&rsquo;s
      dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deep and persistent melancholy, though disguised by the Countess, was
      a perilous malady for which Monsieur de Clagny knew no remedy; for true
      love is often clumsy, especially when it is not reciprocated. True love
      takes its expression from the character. Now, this good man loved after
      the fashion of Alceste, when Madame de la Baudraye wanted to be loved
      after the manner of Philinte. The meaner side of love can never get on
      with the Misanthrope&rsquo;s loyalty. Thus, Dinah had taken care never to open
      her heart to this man. How could she confess to him that she sometimes
      regretted the slough she had left?
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a void in this fashionable life; she had no one for whom to
      dress, or whom to tell of her successes and triumphs. Sometimes the memory
      of her wretchedness came to her, mingled with memories of consuming joys.
      She would hate Lousteau for not taking any pains to follow her; she would
      have liked to get tender or furious letters from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinah made no reply, so Monsieur de Clagny repeated the question, taking
      the Countess&rsquo; hand and pressing it between his own with devout respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have the right hand or the left?&rdquo; said she, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The left,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I suppose you mean the truth or a fib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I saw him,&rdquo; she said, speaking into the lawyer&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;And as
      I saw him looking so sad, so out of heart, I said to myself, Has he a
      cigar? Has he any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish for the truth, I can tell it you,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;He is
      living as a husband with Fanny Beaupre. You have forced me to tell you
      this secret; I should never have told you, for you might have suspected me
      perhaps of an ungenerous motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye grasped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband,&rdquo; said she to her chaperon, &ldquo;is one of the rarest souls!&mdash;Ah!
      Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank into her corner, looking out of the window, but she did not
      finish her sentence, of which the lawyer could guess the end: &ldquo;Why had not
      Lousteau a little of your husband&rsquo;s generosity of heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information served, however, to cure Dinah of her melancholy; she
      threw herself into the whirl of fashion. She wished for success, and she
      achieved it; still, she did not make much way with women, and found it
      difficult to get introductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of March, Madame Piedefer&rsquo;s friends the priests and Monsieur
      de Clagny made a fine stroke by getting Madame de la Baudraye appointed
      receiver of subscriptions for the great charitable work founded by Madame
      de Carcado. Then she was commissioned to collect from the Royal Family
      their donations for the benefit of the sufferers from the earthquake at
      Guadeloupe. The Marquise d&rsquo;Espard, to whom Monsieur de Canalis read the
      list of ladies thus appointed, one evening at the Opera, said, on hearing
      that of the Countess:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived a long time in the world, and I can remember nothing finer
      than the manoeuvres undertaken for the rehabilitation of Madame de la
      Baudraye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the early spring, which, by some whim of our planets, smiled on Paris
      in the first week of March in 1843, making the Champs-Elysees green and
      leafy before Longchamp, Fanny Beaupre&rsquo;s attache had seen Madame de la
      Baudraye several times without being seen by her. More than once he was
      stung to the heart by one of those promptings of jealousy and envy
      familiar to those who are born and bred provincials, when he beheld his
      former mistress comfortably ensconced in a handsome carriage, well
      dressed, with dreamy eyes, and his two little boys, one at each window. He
      accused himself with all the more virulence because he was waging war with
      the sharpest poverty of all&mdash;poverty unconfessed. Like all
      essentially light and frivolous natures, he cherished the singular point
      of honor which consists in never derogating in the eyes of one&rsquo;s own
      little public, which makes men on the Bourse commit crimes to escape
      expulsion from the temple of the goddess Per-cent, and has given some
      criminals courage enough to perform acts of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau dined and breakfasted and smoked as if he were a rich man. Not
      for an inheritance would he have bought any but the dearest cigars, for
      himself as well as for the playwright or author with whom he went into the
      shop. The journalist took his walks abroad in patent leather boots; but he
      was constantly afraid of an execution on goods which, to use the bailiff&rsquo;s
      slang, had already received the last sacrament. Fanny Beaupre had nothing
      left to pawn, and her salary was pledged to pay her debts. After
      exhausting every possible advance of pay from newspapers, magazines, and
      publishers, Etienne knew not of what ink he could churn gold.
      Gambling-houses, so ruthlessly suppressed, could no longer, as of old,
      cash I O U&rsquo;s drawn over the green table by beggary in despair. In short,
      the journalist was reduced to such extremity that he had just borrowed a
      hundred francs of the poorest of his friends, Bixiou, from whom he had
      never yet asked for a franc. What distressed Lousteau was not the fact of
      owing five thousand francs, but seeing himself bereft of his elegance, and
      of the furniture purchased at the cost of so many privations, and added to
      by Madame de la Baudraye.
    </p>
    <p>
      On April the 3rd, a yellow poster, torn down by the porter after being
      displayed on the wall, announced the sale of a handsome suite of furniture
      on the following Saturday, the day fixed for sales under legal authority.
      Lousteau was taking a walk, smoking cigars, and seeking ideas&mdash;for,
      in Paris, ideas are in the air, they smile on you from a street corner,
      they splash up with a spurt of mud from under the wheels of a cab! Thus
      loafing, he had been seeking ideas for articles, and subjects for novels
      for a month past, and had found nothing but friends who carried him off to
      dinner or to the play, and who intoxicated his woes, telling him that
      champagne would inspire him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware,&rdquo; said the virulent Bixiou one night, the man who would at the
      same moment give a comrade a hundred francs and stab him to the heart with
      a sarcasm; &ldquo;if you go to sleep drunk every night, one day you will wake up
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the day before, the Friday, the unhappy wretch, although he was
      accustomed to poverty, felt like a man condemned to death. Of old he would
      have said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the furniture is very old! I will buy new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was incapable now of literary legerdemain. Publishers, undermined
      by piracy, paid badly; the newspapers made close bargains with hard-driven
      writers, as the Opera managers did with tenors that sang flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, his eye on the crowd, though seeing nothing, a cigar in his
      mouth, and his hands in his pockets, every feature of his face twitching,
      and an affected smile on his lips. Then he saw Madame de la Baudraye go by
      in a carriage; she was going to the Boulevard by the Rue de la Chaussee
      d&rsquo;Antin to drive in the Bois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing else left!&rdquo; said he to himself, and he went home to
      smarten himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at seven, he arrived in a hackney cab at Madame de la
      Baudraye&rsquo;s door, and begged the porter to send a note up to the Countess&mdash;a
      few lines, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Madame la Comtesse do Monsieur Lousteau the favor of receiving him
      for a moment, and at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This note was sealed with a seal which as lovers they had both used.
      Madame de la Baudraye had had the word <i>Parce que</i> engraved on a
      genuine Oriental carnelian&mdash;a potent word&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s word&mdash;the
      word that accounts for everything, even for the Creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess had just finished dressing to go to the Opera; Friday was her
      night in turn for her box. At the sight of this seal she turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; she said, tucking the note into her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was firm enough to conceal her agitation, and begged her mother to see
      the children put to bed. She then sent for Lousteau, and received him in a
      boudoir, next to the great drawing-room, with open doors. She was going to
      a ball after the Opera, and was wearing a beautiful dress of brocade in
      stripes alternately plain and flowered with pale blue. Her gloves, trimmed
      with tassels, showed off her beautiful white arms. She was shimmering with
      lace and all the dainty trifles required by fashion. Her hair, dressed <i>a
      la Sevigne</i>, gave her a look of elegance; a necklace of pearls lay on
      her bosom like bubbles on snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, monsieur?&rdquo; said the Countess, putting out her foot
      from below her skirt to rest it on a velvet cushion. &ldquo;I thought, I hoped,
      I was quite forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should reply <i>Never</i>, you would refuse to believe me,&rdquo; said
      Lousteau, who remained standing, or walked about the room, chewing the
      flowers he plucked from the flower-stands full of plants that scented the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment silence reigned. Madame de la Baudraye, studying Lousteau,
      saw that he was dressed as the most fastidious dandy might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the only person in the world who can help me, or hold out a plank
      to me&mdash;for I am drowning, and have already swallowed more than one
      mouthful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said he, standing still in front of Dinah, and
      seeming to yield to an overpowering impulse. &ldquo;Since you see me here, it is
      because my affairs are going to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause, during which Lousteau turned away, took out his
      handkerchief, and seemed to wipe away a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want, Etienne,&rdquo; she went on in motherly tones. &ldquo;We are at
      this moment old comrades; speak to me as you would to&mdash;to Bixiou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save my furniture from vanishing into thin air to-morrow morning at
      the auction mart, eighteen hundred francs! To repay my friends, as much
      again! Three quarters&rsquo; rent to the landlord&mdash;whom you know.&mdash;My
      &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; wants five hundred francs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you!&mdash;to live on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have my pen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is heavier to lift than any one could believe who reads your
      articles,&rdquo; said she, with a subtle smile.&mdash;&ldquo;I have not such a sum as
      you need, but come to-morrow at eight; the bailiff will surely wait till
      nine, especially if you bring him away to pay him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She must, she felt, dismiss Lousteau, who affected to be unable to look at
      her; she herself felt such pity as might cut every social Gordian knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she added, rising and offering her hand to Lousteau. &ldquo;Your
      confidence has done me good! It is long indeed since my heart has known
      such joy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lousteau took her hand and pressed it tenderly to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drop of water in the desert&mdash;and sent by the hand of an angel! God
      always does things handsomely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke half in jest and half pathetically; but, believe me, as a piece
      of acting it was as fine as Talma&rsquo;s in his famous part of <i>Leicester</i>,
      which was played throughout with touches of this kind. Dinah felt his
      heart beating through his coat; it was throbbing with satisfaction, for
      the journalist had had a narrow escape from the hulks of justice; but it
      also beat with a very natural fire at seeing Dinah rejuvenescent and
      restored by wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Baudraye, stealing an examining glance at Etienne, saw that
      his expression was in harmony with the flowers of love, which, as she
      thought, had blossomed again in that throbbing heart; she tried to look
      once into the eyes of the man she had loved so well, but the seething
      blood rushed through her veins and mounted to her brain. Their eyes met
      with the same fiery glow as had encouraged Lousteau on the Quay by the
      Loire to crumple Dinah&rsquo;s muslin gown. The Bohemian put his arm round her
      waist, she yielded, and their cheeks were touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes my mother, hide!&rdquo; cried Dinah in alarm. And she hurried
      forward to intercept Madame Piedefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said she&mdash;this word was to the stern old lady a coaxing
      expression which never failed of its effect&mdash;&ldquo;will you do me a great
      favor? Take the carriage and go yourself to my banker, Monsieur Mongenod,
      with a note I will give you, and bring back six thousand francs. Come,
      come&mdash;it is an act of charity; come into my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she dragged away her mother, who seemed very anxious to see who it was
      that her daughter had been talking with in the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards, Madame Piedefer held a conference with the cure of
      the parish. After listening to the lamentations of the old mother, who was
      in despair, the priest said very gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any moral regeneration which is not based on a strong religious
      sentiment, and carried out in the bosom of the Church, is built on sand.&mdash;The
      many means of grace enjoined by the Catholic religion, small as they are,
      and not understood, are so many dams necessary to restrain the violence of
      evil promptings. Persuade your daughter to perform all her religious
      duties, and we shall save her yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within ten days of this meeting the Hotel de la Baudraye was shut up. The
      Countess, the children, and her mother, in short, the whole household,
      including a tutor, had gone away to Sancerre, where Dinah intended to
      spend the summer. She was everything that was nice to the Count, people
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the Muse of Sancerre had simply come back to family and married
      life; but certain evil tongues declared that she had been compelled to
      come back, for that the little peer&rsquo;s wishes would no doubt be fulfilled&mdash;he
      hoped for a little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatien and Monsieur Gravier lavished every care, every servile attention
      on the handsome Countess. Gatien, who during Madame de la Baudraye&rsquo;s long
      absence had been to Paris to learn the art of <i>lionnerie</i> or
      dandyism, was supposed to have a good chance of finding favor in the eyes
      of the disenchanted &ldquo;Superior Woman.&rdquo; Others bet on the tutor; Madame
      Piedefer urged the claims of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1844, about the middle of June, as the Comte de la Baudraye was taking
      a walk on the Mall at Sancerre with the two fine little boys, he met
      Monsieur Milaud, the Public Prosecutor, who was at Sancerre on business,
      and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are my children, cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! so these are our children!&rdquo; replied the lawyer, with a
      mischievous twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARIS, June 1843-August 1844.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
